    "title": "Variational Masked Diffusion Models",
    "summary": "Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for\ndiscrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked\ndiffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens\nthat are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when\ndependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among\ntokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that\nintroduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through\ncontrolled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD\nsuccessfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to\ncapture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku\npuzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves\nglobal consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality\nand dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational\ninference into masked diffusion.

    "summary": "Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,\nefficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic\nidentity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation\nmethods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as\nPersonalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content\nthat align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D\ngeneration is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE\n(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.\nIt takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as\ninput and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.\nThen, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling\nthe identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view\nobservations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity\npreservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when\nscaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,\nself-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation\nto prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a\nself-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain\nexpert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context\nProtocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated\nsuite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful\ntrajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and\nconsolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs\nretrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and\nuse cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across\nseveral benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains\nstrong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves\n83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result\nwhile reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a\nstrong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from\ngeneralist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both\naccuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly\nface the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.\nExisting unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a\nregularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.\nThis often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained\ndata, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of\nLLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced\nvia a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output\ndistribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is\npreserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to\nentropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and\nmaintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust\noptimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual\nalgorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through\nthe dynamics of the dual variable, all without any extra computational\noverhead. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM\narchitectures demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or exceeds\nstate-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted information while\npreserving downstream utility.",

    "summary": "Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments\nto obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing\nmethods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions\nwithout explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and\nresults in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective\nresponses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates\nexternal tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more\nuseful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better\nexploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining\nadditional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more\naccurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's\nability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA\ndata generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks\nwith reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,\nwe collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a\ntraining set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping\nwith the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on\nEQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by\n9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot\nToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench\ndatasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see\nhttps://tooleqa.github.io.",

To address these challenges, we propose\nMulti-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in\nsolving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge\nQ&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents\n(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies\nreinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates\nquestions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while\nco-evolving.

    "title": "UrbanVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Urban Micromobility",
    "summary": "Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable\nnavigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon\nroute instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic\nand unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation\nmethods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective\nurban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills:\nlow-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and\nhigh-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we\npropose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework\ndesigned for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy\nroute waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently\nplans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels\nof navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories\nparsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on\na mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety\nand adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA\nsurpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban.\nFurthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both\nscalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world\nuncertainties.",

    "summary": "The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing\ndiverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable\nevaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally\nconstrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to\nreproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train\nand test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models\ntrained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments.\nAs policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify,\nsince defining \"success\" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of\nexecution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework\nthat overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale\nsimulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging\nadvances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and\ndifferentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video\ndemonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts.\nWithin these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated\nVLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from\ncrowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup,\nresetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To\nmeasure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along\nmultiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy\ngeneralization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously\nevolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot\nmanipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's\nrobotics landscape.",

In this work, we propose SafeMERGE, a lightweight, post-fine-tuning\nframework that preserves safety while maintaining downstream performance.\nSafeMERGE selectively merges fine-tuned with safety-aligned model layers only\nwhen they deviate from safe behavior, measured by a cosine similarity\ncriterion. Across three LLMs and two tasks, SafeMERGE consistently reduces\nharmful outputs compared to other defenses, with negligible or even positive\nimpact on utility.

    "summary": "Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel\nat this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is\nfundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate\nfluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as\nabstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes\ninto finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This\nrecursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,\nenabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.\nFurthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,\nmulti-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical\ndecision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly\nsurpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates\nexceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that\nunifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful\nand effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

    "summary": "Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on\npost-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction\nfollowing, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training\ndatasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to\nthe public, with limited information about their construction process. This\nlack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source\npost-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield\nperformance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain\nchallenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them\nrigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains\nunclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence\ndownstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct\nthe first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open\npost-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie\nframework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including\nturn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and\nresponse quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and\nqualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on\nthese insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data\nmixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset\nwhile matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings\noffer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training\ndatasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To\nsupport future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets\nand our curated TuluTalk mixture.",

    "summary": "We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our\nmain contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions\nof the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic\nsystem of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit\ncharacterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a\nfunction space. This framework provides a transparent description of local\nbifurcations, characterizing their periodicity, and resonance structures, while\naccommodating singular potentials. We derive analytic expressions that\ncharacterize the emergence, form and shape (supercritical, critical,\nsubcritical or transcritical) of bifurcations involving possibly multiple\nFourier modes and connect them with discontinuous phase transitions. We also\ncharacterize, under suitable assumptions, the detailed structure of the\nstationary bifurcating solutions that are accurate upto an arbitrary number of\nFourier modes. At the global level, we establish regularity and concavity\nproperties of the free energy landscape, proving existence, compactness, and\ncoexistence of globally minimizing stationary measures, further identifying\ndiscontinuous phase transitions with points of non-differentiability of the\nminimum free energy map. As an application, we specialize the theory to the\nNoisy Mean-Field Transformer model, where we show how changing the inverse\ntemperature parameter $\\beta$ affects the geometry of the infinitely many\nbifurcations from the uniform measure. We also explain how increasing $\\beta$\ncan lead to a rich class of approximate multi-mode stationary solutions which\ncan be seen as `metastable states'. Further, a sharp transition from continuous\nto discontinuous (first-order) phase behavior is observed as $\\beta$ increases.",

    "title": "DmC: Nearest Neighbor Guidance Diffusion Model for Offline Cross-domain\n  Reinforcement Learning",
    "summary": "Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample\nefficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key\nchallenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to\nthe target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring\ndomain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or\nmutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods\noften require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world\nscenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited\ntarget data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,\nwhich is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to\noverfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in\nuninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset\nof the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these\nissues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with\nlimited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor\n($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network\ntraining, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain\nproximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate\nadditional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus\nenhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through\ntheoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,\nwe demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain\noffline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.",

    "summary": "Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers\na promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without\ncompromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods\nstruggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the\nstructure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,\nreferred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can\ngenerate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift\nthe challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by\nleveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes\neach private image into a concise textual description using image to text\nmodels, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP\ntext, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI\nrequires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a\nprivate dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality\nthan prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID\nequal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private Evolution FID\nof 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID equal to 33.27 at\nepsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine tuning baselines. Overall,\nour results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries\nprovides a resource efficient and proprietary model compatible framework for\ngenerating high resolution DP synthetic images, greatly expanding access to\nprivate visual datasets.",

To realize this shift,\nemotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues\nunderlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for\npredicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.\nHowever, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that\ndiverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own\npredicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for\nmisunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address\nthis, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and\nan Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is\nexplicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion\nrecognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional\npaired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves\nfaithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on\nthe MAFW and DFEW datasets.

Therefore, mixed\nprecision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use\nlow-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their\nsuccess, these principles are currently not reliable for training\ncontinuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations\n(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for\nneural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation\nscheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.\nOur scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,\nparameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while\nstability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating\nthe solution and gradients in higher precision.

Specifically,\nthe mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training\ncapabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task,\noverfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as\nillustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a\npractical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany\nand predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to\nprovide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of\nfine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when\nconfiguring models for specific applications.

However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is\noften inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of\nfaithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to\nthe RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved\nvision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information\ninto its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual\ninformation. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by\nmeasuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts\nare intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged\nunder visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,\nindicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze\nvisual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that\nquantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability\nand sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current\nMCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component\nCause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate\nsufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of\nleading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free\nand compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner.

    "title": "BBOPlace-Bench: Benchmarking Black-Box Optimization for Chip Placement",
    "summary": "Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial\nimpact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.\nThe use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of\nseveral decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem\nformulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the\neffectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential\nto achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field\nlacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various\nproblem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose\nBBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and\ndeveloping BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem\nformulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and\nflexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and\ncompare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of\nexisting BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary\nalgorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show\nthat the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter\noptimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem\nformulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,\nespecially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench\nnot only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip\nplacement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are\nurgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available\nat https://github.com/lamda-bbo/BBOPlace-Bench.",

    "title": "Robust Decision Making with Partially Calibrated Forecasts",
    "summary": "Calibration has emerged as a foundational goal in ``trustworthy machine\nlearning'', in part because of its strong decision theoretic semantics.\nIndependent of the underlying distribution, and independent of the decision\nmaker's utility function, calibration promises that amongst all policies\nmapping predictions to actions, the uniformly best policy is the one that\n``trusts the predictions'' and acts as if they were correct. But this is true\nonly of \\emph{fully calibrated} forecasts, which are tractable to guarantee\nonly for very low dimensional prediction problems. For higher dimensional\nprediction problems (e.g. when outcomes are multiclass), weaker forms of\ncalibration have been studied that lack these decision theoretic properties. In\nthis paper we study how a conservative decision maker should map predictions\nendowed with these weaker (``partial'') calibration guarantees to actions, in a\nway that is robust in a minimax sense: i.e. to maximize their expected utility\nin the worst case over distributions consistent with the calibration\nguarantees. We characterize their minimax optimal decision rule via a duality\nargument, and show that surprisingly, ``trusting the predictions and acting\naccordingly'' is recovered in this minimax sense by \\emph{decision calibration}\n(and any strictly stronger notion of calibration), a substantially weaker and\nmore tractable condition than full calibration. For calibration guarantees that\nfall short of decision calibration, the minimax optimal decision rule is still\nefficiently computable, and we provide an empirical evaluation of a natural one\nthat applies to any regression model solved to optimize squared error.",

    "summary": "Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nfiling reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very\nimportant for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length,\nfinancial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.\nPrior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive\nlabeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial\ntargets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for\nstance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per\nshare (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual\nreports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using\nthe advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this\ncorpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models\n(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting\nstrategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best\ncompared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC\nand ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging\nLLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring\nextensive labeled data.",

    "summary": "Most existing sound event detection~(SED) algorithms operate under a\nclosed-set assumption, restricting their detection capabilities to predefined\nclasses. While recent efforts have explored language-driven zero-shot SED by\nexploiting audio-language models, their performance is still far from\nsatisfactory due to the lack of fine-grained alignment and cross-modal feature\nfusion. In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a\nquery-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries.\nDASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are\nmatched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support\nthis formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly\ndecouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event\ndecoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound\nevents at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies\nfor frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking\nstrategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel\nclasses, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments\non the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances\nlocalization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming\nCLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in\nthe closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS). Furthermore, in cross-dataset zero-shot\nevaluation on DESED, DASM achieves a PSDS1 score of 42.2, even exceeding the\nsupervised CRNN baseline.

Inference-time reward alignment with score-based\ngenerative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader\nparadigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of\nthis trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising\nprocess. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the\nGaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results\nin reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the\nreward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable\nposterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the\npreconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines\ndimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach\nenables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves\nperformance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image\ngeneration, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as\ndemonstrated in our experiments.

Despite its effectiveness\nin inference speedup, previous work on vocabulary expansion has focused on\nhigh-resource settings assuming access to a substantial amount of target\nlanguage data to effectively initialize the embeddings of the new tokens and\nadapt the LLM to the target language. However, vocabulary expansion in\nlow-resource settings has yet to be explored. In this article, we investigate\nvocabulary expansion in low-resource settings by considering embedding\ninitialization methods and continual pre-training strategies. Through extensive\nexperiments across typologically diverse languages, tasks and models, we\nestablish a set of strategies to perform vocabulary expansion for faster\ninference, while striving to maintain competitive downstream performance to\nbaselines. This is achieved with only 30K sentences ($\\sim$0.01GB text data)\nfrom the target language.",

    "title": "A Principle of Targeted Intervention for Multi-Agent Reinforcement\n  Learning",
    "summary": "Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards\ndesired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a\nhuman on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On\nthe other hand, designing external mechanisms (e.g., intrinsic rewards and\nhuman feedback) to coordinate agents mostly relies on empirical studies,\nlacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent\ninfluence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above\nissues. First, we introduce the concept of MARL interaction paradigms\n(orthogonal to MARL learning paradigms), using MAIDs to analyze and visualize\nboth unguided self-organization and global guidance mechanisms in MARL. Then,\nwe design a new MARL interaction paradigm, referred to as the targeted\nintervention paradigm that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the\nproblem of global guidance can be mitigated. In implementation, we introduce a\ncausal inference technique, referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI), to\nrealize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a\nspecial class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates\nthe primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by\nmaximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the\nbundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether\nan MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an MARL interaction\nparadigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\ntargeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.",

While previous work has made great efforts to\nmodel bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in\ngeneralizability across environments since these models are typically tailored\nfor specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the\nscenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the\nachieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross\nmerchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding\nfoundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various\nscenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode\nheterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex\ninter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose\ntwo attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables\nand embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation\nlearning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a\nvariable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome\nprediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a\nzero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero\nprobability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization\nobjective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to\nconverge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the\nad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline\nevaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various\nbaselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by\n4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding\nfoundation model in computational advertising.",

    "summary": "Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives\nefficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by\nassigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation\nmethods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating\nchanges in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as\nopposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different\npatterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods\nbased on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when\nthe validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware\nmethods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical\ndeployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \\emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),\na plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an\nID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral\napproximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and\nOOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then\nestimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via\nperturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV\nplugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional\ntraining loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and\nstable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining\ncomputationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for\nlarge-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to\nOOD-robust data valuation.",

To study our steering\ntechnique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a\ntwo-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge\nnaturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual\ndescriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not\nduring deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation\ncue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert\niteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings.

    "summary": "The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and publicly\navailable ChatGPT have marked a significant turning point in the integration of\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) into people's everyday lives. This study examines\nthe ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate future research ideas\nfrom scientific papers. Unlike tasks such as summarization or translation, idea\ngeneration lacks a clearly defined reference set or structure, making manual\nevaluation the default standard. However, human evaluation in this setting is\nextremely challenging ie: it requires substantial domain expertise, contextual\nunderstanding of the paper, and awareness of the current research landscape.\nThis makes it time-consuming, costly, and fundamentally non-scalable,\nparticularly as new LLMs are being released at a rapid pace. Currently, there\nis no automated evaluation metric specifically designed for this task. To\naddress this gap, we propose two automated evaluation metrics: Idea Alignment\nScore (IAScore) and Idea Distinctness Index. We further conducted human\nevaluation to assess the novelty, relevance, and feasibility of the generated\nfuture research ideas. This investigation offers insights into the evolving\nrole of LLMs in idea generation, highlighting both its capability and\nlimitations. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts in evaluating and\nutilizing language models for generating future research ideas. We make our\ndatasets and codes publicly available",

    "summary": "We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic\nmodels integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data\ngenerators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \\textit{Symbolic Neural\nGenerators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of\nfeasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each\nspecification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a\nneural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic\nspecification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the\ncomplementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG\nis a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible\ninstances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that\nsatisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics\nfor such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \\textit{base} and\n\\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,\nand outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In\nthis extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We\nimplement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming\n(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug\ndesign. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor\nmolecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are\nwell understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood\ntargets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading\nclinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as\npreliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for\nsynthesis and wet-lab testing.",

In this work,\nwe study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of\nrobustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide\nbenefits. We build a recipe called $\\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners\nfor Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to\nreason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that\nbalances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical\ndesign choices: (1) a ``lightweight'' warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of\nharmful, harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as\ntoo many refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of\nreasoning capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit\nadaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to\nbetter safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better\ndistinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to\nboth white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR).

    "summary": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision\nand audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost\nalways executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous\naccelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end\nlatency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design\ninference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models\ninto modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its\nideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into\nmodular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units.\nIt performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on\nunified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level\nscheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our\nframework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs\nentirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent\nassistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher\nthroughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The\ndesign further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage\nthrough token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system\noutperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy\nconsumption by 42.3\\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\\%. This enables a\nbattery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a\nday and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.",

Current evaluations are fragmented,\nbased on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable\nresults. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale,\nstandardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By\nunifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to\neconomic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the\nnecessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM\nsimulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have\nlimited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly\nwith model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased\ninference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off:\ninstruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions\nbut degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle\nwhen simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that\nsimulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive\nreasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939).

    "summary": "Scientific discovery plays a pivotal role in advancing human society, and\nrecent progress in large language models (LLMs) suggests their potential to\naccelerate this process. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can\nautonomously generate novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether LLMs can discover high-quality chemistry hypotheses given\nonly a research background-comprising a question and/or a survey-without\nrestriction on the domain of the question. We begin with the observation that\nhypothesis discovery is a seemingly intractable task. To address this, we\npropose a formal mathematical decomposition grounded in a fundamental\nassumption: that most chemistry hypotheses can be composed from a research\nbackground and a set of inspirations. This decomposition leads to three\npractical subtasks-retrieving inspirations, composing hypotheses with\ninspirations, and ranking hypotheses - which together constitute a sufficient\nset of subtasks for the overall scientific discovery task. We further develop\nan agentic LLM framework, MOOSE-Chem, that is a direct implementation of this\nmathematical decomposition. To evaluate this framework, we construct a\nbenchmark of 51 high-impact chemistry papers published and online after January\n2024, each manually annotated by PhD chemists with background, inspirations,\nand hypothesis. The framework is able to rediscover many hypotheses with high\nsimilarity to the groundtruth, successfully capturing the core\ninnovations-while ensuring no data contamination since it uses an LLM with\nknowledge cutoff date prior to 2024. Finally, based on LLM's surprisingly high\naccuracy on inspiration retrieval, a task with inherently out-of-distribution\nnature, we propose a bold assumption: that LLMs may already encode latent\nscientific knowledge associations not yet recognized by humans.",

    "summary": "Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) represents a cornerstone in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting answers from\nunstructured textual data. With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models\n(LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent\nunderstanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared\nto traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical\nchallenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to\nadaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task\nsituations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named\nGenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge\nIntegration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically,\nwe first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge\nfrom a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge\nintegration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions\nduring fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable\ngeneration in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based\non text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format\nassurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO,\nand CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines.

In such cases, to ensure\nthe human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an\nassistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but\nalso estimate how and when this information can be communicated most\neffectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive\nresource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming\ninformation. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which\nmeets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,\nformalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)\nmodelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely\nalignment between user belief and a dynamic environment.

    "summary": "A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet\nstill coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet\ncontaining a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that\ncelebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could\nconceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible\nthanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and\nefficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter\nopen-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message\nas long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in\nseconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of\ntext from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,\nalready shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete\nscenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its\nanswers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises\nurgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it\nmeans for a Large Language Model to know something.",

    "summary": "This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis:\nthe reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the\nneed for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By\nfocusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain\nadaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,\npresenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep\nlearning in medical imaging.\n  Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative\nneural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain\nadaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image\ndatasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic\ninput-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and\nintegration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex\n3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.\n  Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in\nmedical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of\nextracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing\nthe model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through\nrigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset,\ndemonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features\napplicable to various downstream tasks.\n  In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image\nanalysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on\nlabeled data.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific\nhypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained\nhypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We\nintroduce and formally define the new task of fine-grained scientific\nhypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally\nactionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as\na combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs'\ncapacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four\nfoundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to\nformulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most\npromising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own\ninternal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis\nspace; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment\nwith ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an\nensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than\ndefining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4)\nwhether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape\nthan a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search\nmethod that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis,\nprogressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We\nshow that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables\nmore effective optimization.

Recent\nadvancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to\naddress these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to\nhallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D\nstructures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the\naccuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing\nreconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this\nwork, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative\nmethods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in\nconstructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view\nimage features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative\ndenoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but\ninconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs.

Many existing interpretability are limited in\nthis area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward\npasses of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold\nduring reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence\nlevel is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We\nintroduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual\nimportance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model,\nfiltering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought\nfrom that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution\nof final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized\nimpact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these\nsentences \\textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty\nmanagement sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from\nsubsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining\nsentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a\nmodel's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's\ndifficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or\ndiffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques\ntogether provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by\nconducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math\nproblem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the\nreasoning trace's structure.

    "summary": "Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous\nintrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts\n(e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key\nchallenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch\namong embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy\nrelational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information\naggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding\n(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.\nFirst, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that\nestablishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different\nmodalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we\ndevelop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,\nwhere a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide\ninformative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis\nimplies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb\ngraph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically,\nDAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on\nstandard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains\n0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment\ncontributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp\nFmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for\nrobust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing\nprotein function prediction.",

    "summary": "Circuit discovery, which involves identifying sparse and task-relevant\nsubnetworks in pre-trained language models, is a cornerstone of mechanistic\ninterpretability. Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal\nmethodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models\nis severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory\nrequirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they\nprimarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly\ncompromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating\nautomated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a\nfundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each\nindividual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between\nactivation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability\nanalysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.\nTherefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated\ncomponents while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.\nPAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\\% and memory consumption by\nup to 30\\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.\nImportantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit\ndiscovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This\ntraining-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating\nmechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/626619403/PAHQ.",

Active inference (AIF) based on the\nfree-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by\nminimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and\nextrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework\nthat integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale\nrecurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy\ngenerates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their\nlong-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection\nthat minimizes EFE.

However, the most powerful\nempathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about\nthe architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the\ncritical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,\nwe present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM\ndesigned to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic\nspeech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved\ndecoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate\nend-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction\npipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at\nlow cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content\nand controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional\nvariation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic\ndiversity and minimal human supervision.

    "summary": "In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic\ncurriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach\nprogressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an\nimproved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of\nthe training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a\nresource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score\nperformance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical\nimage segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score\nperformance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a\nnotable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves\nupon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically\nsignificant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,\nacross all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the\nconstant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously\nreducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced\nfor highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous\nexperiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean\nsegmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more\ntrustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the\nproposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but\nrepresents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance\nacross diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In\nsummary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data\nsubstantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while\nbeing compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.",

In addition,\nwe construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and\ntrain our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective,\neliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and\ntraining objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very\nlightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets\n(MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms\nself-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting\nsuperior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical\nutility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached\nconvolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and\nminimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time\napplications.",

Finally, we apply heat operators on these\nfunctions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating\nprecise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of\nBlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results\nfurther validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold\nspeedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying\nphysical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation\ntime, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits\ncomparable performance to that using the existing method.",

Even when\nfine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety\nbehaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned\nmodels. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework\nfor preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key\ncomponents: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.\nFirst, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and\nsafety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value\ndecomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant\nones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated\nsafety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts\nadapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby\nmaintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained\nmodels on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves\nsuperior performance over existing methods.

Unlike methods\nreliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to\nan unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively\nfilter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when\ndiscarding the worst 10% of reports).

    "summary": "Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific\ndisciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural\neigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of\ninference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to\ntraditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large\namounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.\nTo tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev\nSubspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data\ngeneration by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked\nby existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier\ntransform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and\nconstructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from\npreviously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing\nredundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method\nto accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF\nachieves up to a $3.5\\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.",

Thus, unlike other automatic\nabstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition\nprobabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build\nits abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that\nstate-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting\nsymmetric states are far apart in state space.

    "summary": "The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining\nnarrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end\ngeneration approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue\nthis failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two\ndisparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format\nadherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We\naddress this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs\nexisting screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages\nthese inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.\nBlind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%\nwin rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of\nhuman-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation\narchitecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in\ncomplex creative domains.",

    "summary": "While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are\nremarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a\ndiversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,\nsequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:\nquadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these\nlimitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less\nreliant on intensive computations. We introduce Echo State Transformers (EST),\na hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves this challenge while\ndemonstrating exceptional performance in classification and detection tasks.\nEST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from\nReservoir Computing to create a fixed-size window distributed memory system.\nDrawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of\nthe Reservoir Computing paradigm, our approach leverages reservoirs (random\nrecurrent networks) as a lightweight and efficient memory. Our architecture\nintegrates a new module called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs\nworking in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent working memory units\nwith distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical reservoir\nhyperparameters, controlling the dynamics, are now trained. Thus, the EST\ndynamically adapts the reservoir memory/non-linearity trade-off. Thanks to\nthese working memory units, EST achieves constant computational complexity at\neach processing step, effectively breaking the quadratic scaling problem of\nstandard Transformers. We evaluate ESTs on a recent challenging timeseries\nbenchmark: the Time Series Library, which comprises 69 tasks across five\ncategories. Results show that ESTs ranks first overall in two of five\ncategories, outperforming strong state-of-the-art baselines on classification\nand anomaly detection tasks, while remaining competitive on short-term\nforecasting. These results position ESTs as a compelling alternative for\ntime-series classification and anomaly detection, and a practical complement to\ntransformer-style models in applications that prioritize robust representations\nand sensitive event detection.",

    "summary": "The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in\nnon-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While\nprior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex\npreprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance\nhardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability.\nThis study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on\nlow-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture\nrecognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1)\nWe replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating\ncomplex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without\nsacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and\n1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to\nas few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only\nquantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.\nA ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability\nunder tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework\nto support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering\naccuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two\nswipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach\nachieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25\nFPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches\n0.970 average accuracy across users with 9.22 ms latency. The chosen 8-bit\n1D-SepCNN further reduces latency to 6.83 ms (over 53x CPU speedup) with\nslightly lower accuracy (0.949). Both consume under 1.2 mJ per inference,\ndemonstrating suitability for long-term edge operation.",

Conventional architectures typically\nisolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from\ndecision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since\nthe policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is\nimportant. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving\nTransformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that\nalternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer.\nThis interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual\nfeatures dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by\nCLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We\nevaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that\nthe approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a\nstandard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer\nencoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous\nagents.",

This work presents a large-scale\nevaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution\naccuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing\ncounterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that\nquantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident\npre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.\nIntriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other\nreliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these\nsame poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific\nquantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in\nzero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a\nstrict efficiency-performance trade-off.

    "summary": "Improving Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the post-training\nstage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement\nlearning (RL), which require expensive and manually annotated multi-modal\ndata--an ultimately unsustainable resource. This limitation has motivated a\ngrowing interest in unsupervised paradigms as a third stage of post-training\nafter SFT and RL. While recent efforts have explored this direction, their\nmethods are complex and difficult to iterate. To address this, we propose\nMM-UPT, a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of\nMLLMs, enabling continual self-improvement without any external supervision.\nThe training method of MM-UPT builds upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward\nsignals with a self-rewarding mechanism based on majority voting over multiple\nsampled responses. Our experiments demonstrate that such training method\neffectively improves the reasoning ability of Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g.,\n66.3\\%$\\rightarrow$72.9\\% on MathVista, 62.9\\%$\\rightarrow$68.7\\% on We-Math),\nusing standard dataset without ground truth labels. To further explore\nscalability, we extend our framework to a data self-generation setting,\ndesigning two strategies that prompt the MLLM to synthesize new training\nsamples on its own. Additional experiments show that combining these synthetic\ndata with the unsupervised training method can also boost performance,\nhighlighting a promising approach for scalable self-improvement. Overall,\nMM-UPT offers a new paradigm for autonomous enhancement of MLLMs, serving as a\ncritical third step after initial SFT and RL in the absence of external\nsupervision.

    "summary": "Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising\nfrontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a\nfundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the\ntokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,\nrisking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,\nintroducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally\nlimit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion\nof the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades\nperformance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for\nmodels with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the\nprimary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to\ninterpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for\nreasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for\nreframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines\nover expert knowledge.

From a unified reinforcement\nlearning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we\nintroduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models. These include two\ntraining-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO)\nand reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time\ntechnique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos.\nExperimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms\nexisting reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared\nto both Flow-RWR and supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG\nlets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference,\nmeeting personalized video quality needs.",

    "summary": "The growing size of large language models has created significant\ncomputational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation\nmethods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference,\nreducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on\nnon-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN\nlayer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down\nprojection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN,\nleveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct\ncoefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that\nD-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5%\nideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4%\nbetter performance preservation compared to existing methods.

We further propose a novel modular\nframework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to\nassess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a\ndual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can\nalso provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their\nrefusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity;\nthe VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration\nwith diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales.

With the rapid development of large language\nmodels (LLMs), recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs to enhance rating prediction tasks. However, existing\ndistillation-based methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher model's\ninsufficient recommendation capability, costly and static supervision, and\nsuperficial transfer of reasoning ability. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes RecZero, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommendation paradigm\nthat abandons the traditional multi-model and multi-stage distillation\napproach. Instead, RecZero trains a single LLM through pure RL to autonomously\ndevelop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction. RecZero consists of two\nkey components: (1) \"Think-before-Recommendation\" prompt construction, which\nemploys a structured reasoning template to guide the model in step-wise\nanalysis of user interests, item features, and user-item compatibility; and (2)\nrule-based reward modeling, which adopts group relative policy optimization\n(GRPO) to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the LLM.\nAdditionally, the paper explores a hybrid paradigm, RecOne, which combines\nsupervised fine-tuning with RL, initializing the model with cold-start\nreasoning samples and further optimizing it with RL. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that RecZero and RecOne significantly outperform existing baseline\nmethods on multiple benchmark datasets, validating the superiority of the RL\nparadigm in achieving autonomous reasoning-enhanced recommender systems.",

    "title": "ContextAgent: Context-Aware Proactive LLM Agents with Open-World Sensory\n  Perceptions",
    "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled intelligent\nagents from reactive responses to proactive support. While promising, existing\nproactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed\nenvironments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based\nproactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and\nlimited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce\nContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates\nextensive sensory contexts surrounding humans to enhance the proactivity of LLM\nagents. ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive\nsensory perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user\nintentions. ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and personas from\nhistorical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive\nassistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary\ntools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate\nContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive\nLLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty\ntools. Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms\nbaselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive\npredictions and tool calling, respectively. We hope our research can inspire\nthe development of more advanced, human-centric, proactive AI assistants. The\ncode and dataset are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/openaiotlab/ContextAgent.",

    "summary": "Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English\ndocuments and translates them into the query language for low-resource\nsettings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation\nperformance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality\nor utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and\nhallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware\nTranslation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation\nquality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and\nnaturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the\noriginal content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines\nin two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs\nranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages\n(Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG\noutperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling\ngenerator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability.\nThis approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in\nlow-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a\npractical and robust solution across multilingual domains.",

Cognitive diagnostic technology can\nutilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational\nevaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.\nHowever, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,\nthey also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of\ndisciplinary data.

Given the differences in\nknowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between\ndifferent disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network\ncognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive\ndiagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis\nmethod (TLCD).

    "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating\nhigh-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion\nmodels have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image\nediting. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the\nsource image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.\nHowever, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the\ntarget text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while\nenabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility\nneeded for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map\nInversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for\noptimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We\nanalyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this\nanalysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with\nthe desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and\nedited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion\noutperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in\nboth preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also\nbe easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content\nmanipulation across frames.",

We introduce FaithLM, a\nmodel-agnostic framework that evaluates and improves the faithfulness of LLM\nexplanations without token masking or task-specific heuristics. FaithLM\nformalizes explanation faithfulness as an intervention property: a faithful\nexplanation should yield a prediction shift when its content is contradicted.\nTheoretical analysis shows that the resulting contrary-hint score is a sound\nand discriminative estimator of faithfulness. Building on this principle,\nFaithLM iteratively refines both the elicitation prompt and the explanation to\nmaximize the measured score. Experiments on three multi-domain datasets and\nmultiple LLM backbones demonstrate that FaithLM consistently increases\nfaithfulness and produces explanations more aligned with human rationales than\nstrong self-explanation baselines. These findings highlight that\nintervention-based evaluation, coupled with iterative optimization, provides a\nprincipled route toward faithful and reliable LLM explanations.",

We validate AGENT KB across major frameworks on GAIA, Humanity's Last\nExam, GPQA, and SWE-bench.

    "summary": "Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step\nplanning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their\ntrajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory\ncomputational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades\nperformance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform\nacross a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should\nbe more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion\nplanner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.\nMDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL\ntask domains.",

    "summary": "Ordering-based approaches to causal discovery identify topological orders of\ncausal graphs, providing scalable alternatives to combinatorial search methods.\nUnder the Additive Noise Model (ANM) assumption, recent causal ordering methods\nbased on score matching require an accurate estimation of the Hessian diagonal\nof the log-densities. In this paper, we aim to improve the approximation of the\nHessian diagonal of the log-densities, thereby enhancing the performance of\nordering-based causal discovery algorithms. Existing approaches that rely on\nStein gradient estimators are computationally expensive and memory-intensive,\nwhile diffusion-model-based methods remain unstable due to the second-order\nderivatives of score models. To alleviate these problems, we propose\nScore-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in\nsmooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and\nto preserve structural information during the score modeling. Empirical results\nshow that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by\n31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining\nmemory efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic\ncontrol algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that\nintegrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors,\nenabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information.\nConsequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs\nwithout additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering.",

    "summary": "Few-shot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over\nrelations given only a limited number of training examples. While existing\napproaches largely adopt a meta-learning framework for enabling fast adaptation\nto new relations, they suffer from two key pitfalls. First, they learn relation\nmeta-knowledge in isolation, failing to capture common relational patterns\nshared across tasks. Second, they struggle to effectively incorporate local,\ntask-specific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MoEMeta, a novel meta-learning framework that\ndisentangles globally shared knowledge from task-specific contexts to enable\nboth effective generalization and rapid adaptation. MoEMeta introduces two key\ninnovations: (i) a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that learns globally shared\nrelational prototypes to enhance generalization, and (ii) a task-tailored\nadaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast task-specific\nadaptation. By balancing global generalization with local adaptability, MoEMeta\nsignificantly advances few-shot relational learning. Extensive experiments and\nanalyses on three KG benchmarks demonstrate that MoEMeta consistently\noutperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

In this work, we\nprove that the softmax function is contractive with the Lipschitz constant\n$1/2$, uniformly across all $\\ell_p$ norms with $p \\ge 1$. We also show that\nthe local Lipschitz constant of softmax attains $1/2$ for $p = 1$ and $p =\n\\infty$, and for $p \\in (1,\\infty)$, the constant remains strictly below $1/2$\nand the supremum $1/2$ is achieved only in the limit. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first comprehensive norm-uniform analysis of softmax Lipschitz continuity.\nWe demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing\ntheoretical results on robustness and convergence.

In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on\nother ML tasks, e.g., classification models and natural language processing.\nHowever, traditional MIAs are ill-suited for RecSys due to the unseen posterior\nprobability. Although MIAs on RecSys form a newly emerging and rapidly growing\nresearch area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this\narticle, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on RecSys MIAs. This survey\noffers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in RecSys MIAs,\nexploring the design principles, challenges, attack and defense associated with\nthis emerging field.

    "summary": "While language models have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks,\nthey still encounter challenges in complex reasoning scenarios. Recent research\nsuggests that language models trained on linearized search traces toward\nsolutions, rather than solely on the final solutions, exhibit improved\ngeneralization, despite the search traces being potentially noisy or\nsuboptimal. However, relying on such imperfect traces can result in inefficient\nuse of test-time compute. To address this, we propose guided reinforced\nself-training (Guided-ReST), a fine-tuning algorithm designed to improve the\nmodel's capability for effective search during inference. The key insight\nbehind Guided-ReST is that optimal solutions can serve as valuable step-by-step\nlandmarks to guide the model's search process. Based on this insight, we\nintroduce a novel data generation method that seamlessly incorporates optimal\nsolutions into the model's search procedure, enabling the generation of\nhigh-quality search traces. By fine-tuning the model on these search traces, we\neffectively distill improved search strategies into the model.

To\ngenerate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking\nability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human\ninstructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and\nboundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,\nthis paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction\n(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,\nadaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,\nwe propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate\nthe unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language\nreferences. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the\noptimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,\ntherefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of\nmulti-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded\nattacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from\nincomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are\nproposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger\nscenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,\nwe propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by\nclarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more\neffective SemanticAE generators.

    "summary": "Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for\nred-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI\nmodels. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds\nof red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of\nrisks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches\npromise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of\nmodel behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an\ninitial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in\nautomated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,\nthat introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to\nexplore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first\nintroduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either \"red-teaming\nexpert\" personas or \"regular AI user\" personas. We then develop a dynamic\npersona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types\nadaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new\nmetrics to explicitly measure the \"mutation distance\" to complement existing\ndiversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising\nimprovements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts\nthrough persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to\nRainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the\nstrengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,\nshedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between\nautomated and human red-teaming approaches.",

    "summary": "Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key\nstrategy for building Agents that \"think then act.\" However, recent\nobservations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often\ncoincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically\nexamined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To\naddress this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning\nincrease tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,\na diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)\nno tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled\nexperiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal\nrelationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool\nhallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect\ntranscends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still\namplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,\nappearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is\nmerely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step\nthinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering\nand Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental\nreliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades\nutility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses\ntool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as\namplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These\nfindings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify\ntool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that\njointly optimize for capability and reliability.",

However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic\nanswer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically\nmeaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench,\na structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available\nMIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of\nintermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting\nanatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements,\ncomputing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench\nleverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid\nreasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance,\nenabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning.

    "summary": "In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation\nplays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While\ncentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a\ncentral coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer\nfrom scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed\nTraining with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed\nlearning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and\nlimited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion\nModel Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.\nBuilt upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP\nemploys Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future\ntrajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby\nalleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE\nmethods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field\n(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This\ndesign mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with\nminimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further\ntheoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation\nerror introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence\nstability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL\nbaselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its\nscalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.",

    "summary": "Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent\nchallenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,\ngeneral-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic\nclassroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on\nsentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,\ninterpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword\ntokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings\nunder a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our\nresults demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and\neven super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and\nsurpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis\nof annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better\naligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to\nlesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the\nsufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external\nvalidity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added\nmeasures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.\nHowever, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that\nwhile the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full\ngeneralization.

    "summary": "A pinching-antenna system (PASS)-enhanced mobile edge computing (MEC)\narchitecture is investigated to improve the task offloading efficiency and\nlatency performance in dynamic wireless environments. By leveraging dielectric\nwaveguides and flexibly adjustable pinching antennas, PASS establishes\nshort-distance line-of-sight (LoS) links while effectively mitigating the\nsignificant path loss and potential signal blockage, making it a promising\nsolution for high-frequency MEC systems. We formulate a network latency\nminimization problem to joint optimize uplink PASS beamforming and task\noffloading. The resulting problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP)\nand solved via the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. To address the\ninstability introduced by the $\\max$ operator in the objective function, we\npropose a load balancing-aware proximal policy optimization (LBPPO) algorithm.\nLBPPO incorporates both node-level and waveguide-level load balancing\ninformation into the policy design, maintaining computational and transmission\ndelay equilibrium, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed PASS-enhanced MEC with adaptive uplink PASS beamforming exhibit\nstronger convergence capability than fixed-PA baselines and conventional\nMIMO-assisted MEC, especially in scenarios with a large number of UEs or high\ntransmit power.",

Existing studies predominantly concentrate on adversarial attacks or\ninherent flaws within the models. However, a more prevalent yet underexplored\nissue concerns how the quality of a benign but poorly formulated prompt affects\nthe security of the generated code. To investigate this, we first propose an\nevaluation framework for prompt quality encompassing three key dimensions: goal\nclarity, information completeness, and logical consistency. Based on this\nframework, we construct and publicly release CWE-BENCH-PYTHON, a large-scale\nbenchmark dataset containing tasks with prompts categorized into four distinct\nlevels of normativity (L0-L3). Extensive experiments on multiple\nstate-of-the-art LLMs reveal a clear correlation: as prompt normativity\ndecreases, the likelihood of generating insecure code consistently and markedly\nincreases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that advanced prompting techniques, such\nas Chain-of-Thought and Self-Correction, effectively mitigate the security\nrisks introduced by low-quality prompts, substantially improving code safety.\nOur findings highlight that enhancing the quality of user prompts constitutes a\ncritical and effective strategy for strengthening the security of AI-generated\ncode.",

However, existing approaches typically rely on\nperturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and\ninsufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To\naddress these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that\ndirectly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using\noff-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level\nguidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to\nreduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel\nspace. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the\nclassifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,\nthis dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample\ngeneration. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively\ncombines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We\nperform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the\neffectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by\nGOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.",

To overcome this limitation, we propose\nGTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.\nGTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces\nfor different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in\nhyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel\nMamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent\nspace. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses\nspatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),\nenabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes.

However, existing works are mainly\nrestricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack\nof a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real\nresearch scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation\nbenchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically\nrequire integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of\nexternal tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse\nformats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with\nappropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support\nstandardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent\nexecution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and\nprogrammatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most\nadvanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%\naverage accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,\nhighlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical\nfindings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,\noften invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task.

    "summary": "Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a\ngiven source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior\nresearch has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from\nannotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible\nexternal knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often\nincorporated into responses and labeled as \"faithful\", yet the acceptable\nextent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent\nannotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation\nframework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to\nclassify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using\nthis framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a\nnew unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that\neven SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\\sim 6\\%$ of sentences)\nin summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\\sim 8\\%$ on\naverage of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,\nunderscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness\ndetection benchmarks.

    "summary": "Scalable oversight, the process by which weaker AI systems supervise stronger\nones, has been proposed as a key strategy to control future superintelligent\nsystems. However, it is still unclear how scalable oversight itself scales. To\naddress this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of\nsuccessful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the\nsystem being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game\nbetween capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific Elo\nscores that are a piecewise-linear function of their general intelligence, with\ntwo plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and task saturation. We\nvalidate our framework with a modified version of the game Nim and then apply\nit to four oversight games: Mafia, Debate, Backdoor Code and Wargames. For each\ngame, we find scaling laws that approximate how domain performance depends on\ngeneral AI system capability. We then build on our findings in a theoretical\nstudy of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which trusted models\noversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted models in the\nnext step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and derive\nnumerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of oversight\nlevels to maximize the probability of oversight success. We also apply our\ntheory to our four oversight games, where we find that NSO success rates at a\ngeneral Elo gap of 400 are 13.5% for Mafia, 51.7% for Debate, 10.0% for\nBackdoor Code, and 9.4% for Wargames; these rates decline further when\noverseeing stronger systems.",

In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many\nquality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces\njudgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding\ndiluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a\ntwo-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1\nperforms adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical\ndimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,\nevidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a\ntargeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters\nmost. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn\ntraces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making\nthe approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines.

While previous research has identified model collapse as a risk in\nself-improvement, where model outputs become increasingly deterministic, we\ndiscover a more fundamental challenge: the superficial self-improved reasoners\nphenomenon. In particular, our analysis reveals that even when LMs show\nimproved in-domain (ID) reasoning accuracy, they actually compromise their\ngeneralized reasoning capabilities on out-of-domain (OOD) tasks due to\nmemorization rather than genuine. Through a systematic investigation of LM\narchitecture, we discover that during self-improvement, LM weight updates are\nconcentrated in less reasoning-critical layers, leading to superficial\nlearning. To address this, we propose Iterative Model Merging (IMM), a method\nthat strategically combines weights from original and self-improved models to\npreserve generalization while incorporating genuine reasoning improvements.

    "summary": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on telecom datasets is a common\npractice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However, little\nattention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety. Recent\nresearch has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety\nalignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user\nqueries. In this paper, we investigate this issue by fine-tuning LLMs on three\nrepresentative telecom datasets and show that safety degrades even for light\ntelecom domain adaptation. To this end, we introduce TeleHarm, the first\ntelecom-specific red-teaming benchmark, which we use alongside established\nDirect-Harm and HexPhi datasets to systematically assess harmful behavior. We\nfurther extend our analysis to publicly available TeleLLMs that were\ncontinually pre-trained on large telecom corpora, revealing that safety\nalignment is severely lacking, primarily due to the omission of safety-focused\ninstruction tuning. To address these issues, we evaluate three realignment\ndefenses: SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, SafeMERGE. We show that, across all settings,\nthe proposed defenses can effectively restore safety without compromising\ntelecom task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models.\nOur work serves as both a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety\nrealignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, underscoring the need for safety-aware\ninstruction and fine-tuning in the telecom domain.",

Yet, no existing benchmarks offer a systematic and comprehensive\nevaluation of this sensitivity. We introduce ISA-Bench, a dynamic benchmark\nevaluating instruction sensitivity for LALMs along three axes: instruction\ndescription, output format, and task composition. We assess recent open-source\nand proprietary LALMs using ISA-Bench, profiling both compliance and accuracy\nunder controlled instruction variations. Experimental results reveal that even\nstate-of-the-art LALMs suffer significant instruction sensitivity, leading to\ndegraded performance on fundamental audio understanding tasks. To mitigate this\nissue, we fine-tune Qwen2-Audio on a specifically constructed complex\ninstruction-variant dataset, achieving a marked improvement in\ninstruction-following performance.

Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,\ntrained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions\nfrom an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to\nextract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer\nmodel trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5\nlanguages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our\narchitecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is\nevaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and\ntranslation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates\npromising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for\ntranslating text directly from images.",

    "summary": "The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around\ndetection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about\ntoxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their\ntrustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on\nexplainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate\nfree-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text\nperturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a\nnovel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned\nFaithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity\nexplanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We\ndevelop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively\nevaluate HAF of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and\nhighlight how \"non-ideal\" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments\non three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five\ndiverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible\nexplanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when\nprompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the\nindividual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and\nirrelevant responses. We open-source our code at\nhttps://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF and LLM-generated explanations at\nhttps://huggingface.co/collections/uofthcdslab/haf.",

    "summary": "Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate\nresponses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing\nbenchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without\ndirectly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical\nbecause without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot\ngenerate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we\nintroduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting\nanswers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we\npropose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized\nQuestion Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized\nintents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer\nselection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting\ntheir acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains\nthrough systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality\ncontrol combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental\nevaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems\nstruggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail\nto identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as\nquestion complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly\navailable to facilitate future research in this direction.",

    "summary": "Cancer patients are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) for\nmedical information, making it critical to assess how well these models handle\ncomplex, personalized questions. However, current medical benchmarks focus on\nmedical exams or consumer-searched questions and do not evaluate LLMs on real\npatient questions with patient details. In this paper, we first have three\nhematology-oncology physicians evaluate cancer-related questions drawn from\nreal patients. While LLM responses are generally accurate, the models\nfrequently fail to recognize or address false presuppositions in the questions,\nposing risks to safe medical decision-making. To study this limitation\nsystematically, we introduce Cancer-Myth, an expert-verified adversarial\ndataset of 585 cancer-related questions with false presuppositions. On this\nbenchmark, no frontier LLM -- including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and\nClaude-4-Sonnet -- corrects these false presuppositions more than $43\\%$ of the\ntime. To study mitigation strategies, we further construct a 150-question\nCancer-Myth-NFP set, in which physicians confirm the absence of false\npresuppositions. We find typical mitigation strategies, such as adding\nprecautionary prompts with GEPA optimization, can raise accuracy on Cancer-Myth\nto $80\\%$, but at the cost of misidentifying presuppositions in $41\\%$ of\nCancer-Myth-NFP questions and causing a $10\\%$ relative performance drop on\nother medical benchmarks. These findings highlight a critical gap in the\nreliability of LLMs, show that prompting alone is not a reliable remedy for\nfalse presuppositions, and underscore the need for more robust safeguards in\nmedical AI systems.",

In this work, we shed light\non the mechanism of in-context retrieval augmentation for question answering by\nviewing a prompt as a composition of informational components. We propose an\nattribution-based method to identify specialized attention heads, revealing\nin-context heads that comprehend instructions and retrieve relevant contextual\ninformation, and parametric heads that store entities' relational knowledge.

However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has\nrarely been explored.

Meanwhile, we propose\na Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models\nwith different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities\nand work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the\ncapability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we\nutilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models\nto solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of\ntext-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated\nthe effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive\niterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models\n(within 70B).",

Audio-only baselines\nexceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields\nsubstantial 50% improvements, highlighting the importance of multi-modality.

While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such\nas code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding\ntasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new\npipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first\nconstruct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on\ncode aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system\nthat evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics.\nBuilding on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the\nGRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.\nFinally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics.\nExperimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K\nwith reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly\nimproves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing\nbenchmarks such as PandasPlotBench.

Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic\nsources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a\nproprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works\nin linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside\nthousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned\nthrough a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the\nmeaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across\nclassical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on\ncomprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant\nresponses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that\noften fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen\nuses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its\ncore innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the\n\"Utility Gap Crisis\" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'\ncore needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By\nprioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an\ninformation repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030.\nThe model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with\nmulti-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both\ncultural preservation and general knowledge domains.",

    "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate\nhallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external\nknowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle\nwith large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent\nadvances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,\nenabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.\nHowever, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and\ncostly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs\nwith incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In\nthis paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose\nLinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient\nframework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage\nretrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical\ngraph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic\nlinking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph\nconstruction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token\nconsumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original\npassages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant\nentity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage\nretrieval through global importance aggregation.

    "title": "Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-Thought Is Necessary for\n  LLMs?",
    "summary": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for\nenhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While\nextended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary\nand substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning\nmodels in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose\ncontrols that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it\nis used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks\nit improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even\nharms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a\nmodel invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To\nthis end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence\nestimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free\nconfidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an\noracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we\nshow that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT\nand outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual\nconfidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the\nmodel, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in\npractice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights\nthe potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more\nreliable adaptive gating of CoT.",

    "summary": "The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a\nbase word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to\nconsider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any\ninformation about their frequency distribution. However, in production\ndeployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world\ndistribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind,\nwe explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of\nmorphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development:\n(i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which\nevaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted\nstrategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different\nfrequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement\nthe standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats\nall items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns\ngreater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running\ntext; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the\ncontext of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates\nword frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training\noutperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.",

    "title": "Beyond Higher Rank: Token-wise Input-Output Projections for Efficient\n  Low-Rank Adaptation",
    "summary": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method\nwidely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the\nprojection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the\ndimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens\nshare the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This\nlimits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent\nsemantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose\nToken-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts\nLoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise\ninput-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of\nTopLoRA can be expressed as $B\\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank\nmatrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated\nfrom each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA\nweights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA\nweights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments\nacross multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently\noutperforms LoRA and its variants.

    "summary": "Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models\n(LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM\nembedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the\ndistinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental\nto time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel\nMulti-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical\ntime-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four\nspecialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys\ndataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and\nseries-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that\nembed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial\nautocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined\nwith raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment\nmodule to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM\nand projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse\ndatasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based\nmethods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs\nsignificantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when\npaired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in\nlong-term forecasting tasks.",

However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual\nhead capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its\nvariants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) -\nsimply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To\naddress this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which\nenables attention heads to \"knock\" on each other - facilitating cross-head\nfeature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is\nachieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across\nall heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization\nat the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn\nintegrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and\nFLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention\nvariants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B\nactivated) on 1T high-quality tokens.

This paper reexamines SMoEs through the\nlens of \\textit{Linear Programming}, and proposes a Unified Sparse Mixture of\nExperts (USMoE) framework that addresses these limitations. Specifically, our\napproach introduces a unified mechanism that integrates information from both\nthe expert and token dimensions, and a unified scoring function that linearly\ncombines similarity scores between experts and tokens. We provide both\ntheoretical justification and empirical evidence demonstrating USMoE's\neffectiveness in overcoming the limitations of traditional routing methods.\nThrough comprehensive evaluations on both clean and corrupted settings for\nlarge language models and vision tasks, under both training-free and training\nscenarios, USMoE achieves up to a 10\\% performance improvement over standard\napproaches or reduces inference costs by up to 14\\%, while maintaining\ncompetitive accuracy.",

    "summary": "Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is\ncrucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context\ncomposition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine\nbasic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than\nthe standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in\ntraining. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative\nopen-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to\nprobe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can\nhave a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models\ngenerally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with\nChain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is\ncrucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent\nresearch area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both\nalgorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress,\nseveral critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized\nguidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their\nunderlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings,\nvariations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led\nto conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these\ntechniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting\nappropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL\ntechniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a\nunified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable\nscenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained\nexperiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and\narchitectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for\nselecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable\nroadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we\nreveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning\ncapability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss.

    "summary": "Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question\nanswering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the\nlargest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to\nmitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval\nstrategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,\nknowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose\nTagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy\nthat boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and\naltering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our\nhypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant\nquestion-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging\nthe context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to\nconsistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token\ncontexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop\nqueries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text.

    "summary": "Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative\ncontent, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought\nthrough repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for\nevaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks\nsuch as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a\nsingle model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,\nreal-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible\nanswers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive\ntaxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to\nLMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that\nfurther breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a\nlarge-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial\nHivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)\nintra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar\nresponses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models\nproduce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human\nannotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25\nindependent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and\nindividual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our\nfindings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated\nto human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic\nannotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,\nINFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically\nstudying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to\nguide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the\nArtificial Hivemind.",

In English, for example, words of Germanic and Latinate\norigin exhibit different stress patterns, and a certain syntactic structure,\ndouble-object datives, is predominantly associated with Germanic verbs rather\nthan Latinate verbs. As a cognitive model, however, such etymology-based\ngeneralizations face challenges in terms of learnability, since the historical\norigins of words are presumably inaccessible information for general language\nlearners. In this study, we present computational evidence indicating that the\nGermanic-Latinate distinction in the English lexicon is learnable from the\nphonotactic information of individual words. Specifically, we performed an\nunsupervised clustering on corpus-extracted words, and the resulting word\nclusters largely aligned with the etymological distinction. The\nmodel-discovered clusters also recovered various linguistic generalizations\ndocumented in the previous literature regarding the corresponding etymological\nclasses.

Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but it is\nunclear where the benefit comes from. To this end, we perform a controlled\nstudy that scales the vocabulary of the language model from 24K to 196K while\nholding data, computation, and optimization unchanged. We begin by quantifying\nthe complexity of tokenized text -- formalized via Kolmogorov complexity -- and\nshow that larger vocabularies reduce this complexity. Above 24K, every common\nword is already tokenized as a single token, so enlarging vocabulary only\ndeepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. Word-level loss decomposition\nshows that larger vocabularies reduce cross-entropy loss almost exclusively by\nlowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most frequent words, even though loss on the\nrare tail rises. The same frequent words cover roughly 75% of tokens in\ndownstream benchmarks, so this training advantage transfers intact.

Over time, the\ninteraction history between a user and an LLM can provide extensive information\nabout an individual's traits and preferences. However, open questions remain on\nhow well LLMs today can effectively leverage such history to (1) internalize\nthe user's inherent traits and preferences, (2) track how the user profiling\nand preferences evolve over time, and (3) generate personalized responses\naccordingly in new scenarios.\n  In this work, we introduce the PERSONAMEM benchmark. PERSONAMEM features\ncurated user profiles with over 180 simulated user-LLM interaction histories,\neach containing up to 60 sessions of multi-turn conversations across 15\nreal-world tasks that require personalization. Given an in-situ user query,\ni.e. query issued by the user from the first-person perspective, we evaluate\nLLM chatbots' ability to identify the most suitable response according to the\ncurrent state of the user's profile. We observe that current LLMs still\nstruggle to recognize the dynamic evolution in users' profiles over time\nthrough direct prompting approaches. As a consequence, LLMs often fail to\ndeliver responses that align with users' current situations and preferences,\nwith frontier models such as GPT-4.1, o4-mini, GPT-4.5, o1, or Gemini-2.0\nachieving only around 50% overall accuracy, suggesting room for improvement.

    "summary": "Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While\nreinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing \"Aha\"\nmoments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for\nlong-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data\nare scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for\nadvanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis\napproach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context\ntasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large\ncollections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to\ntrace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve\nrelevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on\nKeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning\npattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K\neffectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.\nOn Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA\naccuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches\na score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)\nand DeepSeek-R1 (74.9).

As engineered systems\nevolve toward multi-agent architectures with autonomous LLM-based agents,\ntraditional governance approaches using static rules or fixed network\nstructures fail to address the dynamic uncertainties inherent in real-world\noperations. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates adaptive\ngovernance mechanisms directly into the design of sociotechnical systems\nthrough a unique separation of agent interaction networks from information flow\nnetworks. We introduce a system comprising strategic LLM-based system agents\nthat engage in repeated interactions and a reinforcement learning-based\ngoverning agent that dynamically modulates information transparency. Unlike\nconventional approaches that require direct structural interventions or payoff\nmodifications, our framework preserves agent autonomy while promoting\ncooperation through adaptive information governance. The governing agent learns\nto strategically adjust information disclosure at each timestep, determining\nwhat contextual or historical information each system agent can access.\nExperimental results demonstrate that this RL-based governance significantly\nenhances cooperation compared to static information-sharing baselines.",

    "summary": "Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but\nstandard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are\noften complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach\nthat recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)\nestimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the\nmarginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair\nas samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward\nmodel and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO\nimplicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that\nnaturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging\nfrom 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable\nwith respect to the hyperparameter $\\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,\nand 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better\npreserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of\nablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed\nattributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient\nupdates.",

    "summary": "Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to\npropose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending\nthis idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the\nragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of\ndraft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention\nmasks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations\nviolate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative\ndecoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive\ngeneration. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the\nragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization\nrequirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch\nspeculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of\noverhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences\nand dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead\nwhile preserving per-sequence speculative speedups.

    "summary": "Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become\nubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines\ntheir reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of \"chameleon\nbehavior\" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with\ncontradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in\nsearch-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising\n17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn\nconversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in\nstate-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the\nChameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use\nRate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of\nLlama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent\nfailures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511),\nwith GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small\nacross-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a\nsampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations\nbetween source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes\n(r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that\nlimited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query\nframing.

To resolve this problem, we first\ndefine a new concept called superficial unlearning, which refers to the\nphenomenon where an unlearning method either fails to erase the interconnected\nknowledge it should remove or unintentionally erases irrelevant knowledge.\nBased on the definition, we introduce a new benchmark, FaithUn, to analyze and\nevaluate the faithfulness of unlearning in real-world knowledge QA settings.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel unlearning method, KLUE, which updates only\nknowledge-related neurons to achieve faithful unlearning.

Experimental results demonstrate that\nwidely-used unlearning methods fail to ensure faithful unlearning, while our\nmethod shows significant effectiveness in real-world QA unlearning.",

While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly\nused to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are\nhighly \"entangled,\" mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and\nreasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward\nlinguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult\nto isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we\nintroduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these\ncomponents. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our\nmethod iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four\nnearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,\nreasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)\nbrain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We\nshow that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive\npower, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other\nlinguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions\nbeyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is\ntemporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to\nlexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing\nhierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as\ntheir predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow\nfeatures, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.",

A key structural feature of\nthese interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes\ninto interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been\nwidely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous\nspoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.\nAt the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating\ndiscourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on\ntracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether\nexplicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in\ngroup talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in\nsynchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting\nstrategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences\nperformance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that\ncapture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.\nOur results show that providing clear conversational thread information\nimproves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of\ndownstream analysis on well-structured dialogue.

    "title": "Cross-Lingual Stability and Bias in Instruction-Tuned Language Models\n  for Humanitarian NLP",
    "summary": "Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly\ncommercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human\nrights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight\nalternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages\ncommon in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison\nof commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for\nhuman-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the\ncost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across\n78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four\ninstruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,\nGPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both\nstandard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:\nCalibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),\nand Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale,\ndetermines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and\nbalanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages\n(e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant\nprompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate\nthat multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide\npractical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints\nwith reliability in multilingual deployment.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when\ninstructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions\nprovide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about\npotential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to\nimprove response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction.\nThe empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various\napplications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on\nmoral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic\nself-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and\nprovide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our\nexperimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of\nconvergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral\nconcepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the\nactivated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds. This paper\ndemonstrates the strong potential of moral self-correction by showing that it\nexhibits a desirable property of converged performance.",

    "summary": "We give a simple replacement for the contested \"domain-extension\" in Step 9\nof a recent windowed-QFT lattice algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows (Chen,\n2024). As acknowledged by the author, the reported issue is due to a\nperiodicity/support mismatch when extending only the first coordinate in the\npresence of offsets, which breaks the intended $\\mathbb{Z}_P$-fiber. Our new\nsubroutine replaces domain extension by a pair-shift difference that cancels\nunknown offsets exactly and synthesizes a uniform cyclic subgroup (a\nzero-offset coset) of order $P$ inside $(\\mathbb{Z}_{M_2})^n$. We adopt a\ngate-level access model and run a short prepass that measures the designated\noutcome registers (Chen's Steps 1, 3, and 5), fixing $E=(y',z',h^{\\ast})$.

Periodicity is ubiquitous throughout nature and\nscience. Therefore, neural networks should be equipped with the essential\nability to model and handle periodicity. In this work, we propose FAN, a novel\nneural network that effectively addresses periodicity modeling challenges while\noffering broad applicability similar to MLP with fewer parameters and FLOPs.\nPeriodicity is naturally integrated into FAN's structure and computational\nprocesses by introducing the Fourier Principle. Unlike existing Fourier-based\nnetworks, which possess particular periodicity modeling abilities but face\nchallenges in scaling to deeper networks and are typically designed for\nspecific tasks, our approach overcomes this challenge to enable scaling to\nlarge-scale models and maintains general-purpose modeling capability. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of FAN in periodicity\nmodeling tasks and the effectiveness and generalizability of FAN across a range\nof real-world tasks.

In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end\ngenerative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive\n(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image\nsynthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive\nflow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled\nimplicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity\nin pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction\nscheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant\ngroups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we\ndesign a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference\nspeed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to\nboost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER\nachieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative\nmodels while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.",

To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an\ninteractive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.\nOur approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel\nrepresentation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling\nocclusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected\nlayers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly\nto the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the\nproposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects\nthrough intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires\nno architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings\ncombined with a new complementary data sampling strategy.

    "summary": "Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during\ntemporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their\nidentity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate\ntemporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional\nkeyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address\nthis, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future\ntimesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This\ntransforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model\ncontinuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio\ncues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also\nenables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead\ntarget, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the\ntemporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity\nand consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while\nsmaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human\nanimation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,\nidentity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal\nconditioning across several different architectures.

This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new\ngraph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image\nclassification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and\nrelationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,\nincluding patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph\nconstruction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph\nneural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and\norganising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation\nthat effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental\nevaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,\nexhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.\nOur approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,\nparticularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph\nrepresentation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships\namong visual entities.",

    "summary": "Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a\nchallenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning\ndata. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but\nit is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To\naddress this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning\ncapabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,\nVOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces\nto be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using\nGRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an\neffective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that\nwithout sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,\non-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD\nacross diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and\nLogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and\nimproves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the\nimportance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a\ntext-only teacher.",

    "summary": "Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances\ninto virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally\nstable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition\nmethods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and\ninstability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain\nconstrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that\ncombines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and\nphysically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic\nestimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading\ncomponents, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such\nas shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity\nFields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real\nand synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially\nmore stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while\nscaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results\nindicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically\ngrounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric\nvideo relighting.",

Transfer learning techniques,\nleveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,\nthe impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular\ndistribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional\nneural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised\nTraining (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,\nenhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification\nperformance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based\non the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic\nunlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class\ndistribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream\ntask.

These\nchallenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nand Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and\nreliability in medical reasoning.

We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight\ndistinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in\naverage accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms\nQwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters.

This workflow specifically targets the\ncomplexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the\nchallenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise\ncharacteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city\ncenters. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed\nSemi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS\ntrajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step\nreduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud\nregistration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment\nto avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized\nIterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively\nutilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not\nonly improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more\nthan 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods.

    "summary": "Image-based cell profiling aims to create informative representations of cell\nimages. This technique is critical in drug discovery and has greatly advanced\nwith recent improvements in computer vision. Inspired by recent developments in\nnon-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), this paper provides an initial\nexploration into training a generalizable feature extractor for cell images\nusing such methods. However, there are two major challenges: 1) Unlike typical\nscenarios where each representation is based on a single image, cell profiling\noften involves multiple input images, making it difficult to effectively fuse\nall available information; and 2) There is a large difference between the\ndistributions of cell images and natural images, causing the view-generation\nprocess in existing SSL methods to fail. To address these issues, we propose a\nself-supervised framework with local aggregation to improve cross-site\nconsistency of cell representations. We introduce specialized data augmentation\nand representation post-processing methods tailored to cell images, which\neffectively address the issues mentioned above and result in a robust feature\nextractor. With these improvements, the proposed framework won the Cell Line\nTransferability challenge at CVPR 2025.",

    "summary": "Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos\nbased on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video\nunderstanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown\npromise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the\nchallenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.\n(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond\nthe annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground\nsamples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and\nindistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference\namong multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with\nreflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,\nwe propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict\nquery-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to\nidentify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing\nambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess\nthe training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that\ndynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the\ntraining steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer\npreference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples\nand 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data\ncounterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT).

    "summary": "Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but\nhistorically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,\nespecially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super\nresolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are\neffective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow\ninference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary\ninformation as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic\nimages. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In\nthis study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new\nmultimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built\non frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention\nwith auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and\nSynthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier\nNDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary\ndelineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)\nand 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while\nmaintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers\neffectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,\nyielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:\n0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision\nagriculture.",

To address these challenges, we propose\nTEn-CATG, a text-enriched AVVP framework that combines semantic calibration\nwith category-aware temporal reasoning. More specifically, we design a\nbi-directional text fusion (BiT) module by leveraging audio-visual features as\nsemantic anchors to refine text embeddings, which departs from conventional\ntext-to-feature alignment, thereby mitigating noise and enhancing cross-modal\nconsistency.

    "summary": "Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in\nrobotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further\ndevelopment of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is\nlargely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale\nplatforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality\nand challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack\nconsists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term\nand 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-\nand long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in\nunconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but\nmore realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,\neach video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round\nmeticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of\nPlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is\ndifferent from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by\nfar the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar\ntracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to\nprovide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar\ntrackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation\nreveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the\nchallenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for\nimproving planar tracking.

    "summary": "Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality\ninconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors\n(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched\nconditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical\napplications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible\nany-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both\nmodality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the\ninsight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:\nmodality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and\nmodality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent\ncharacteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key\ncomponents: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric\nLearning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into\nmodality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective\nretrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored\nmetric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity\nbetween the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.\nExtensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID\nbenchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the\nsuperiority of MDReID.

    "summary": "Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled\nHandwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible\napplications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.\nA lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies\nthat reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising\nresults in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently\nproposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method\nrequires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in\nrepetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the\nautoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned\ngeneration task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing\nspecial textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.\nMoreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our\nautoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate\nthat our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer\ninputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the\ntextual prompt, improving content adherence.",

    "summary": "Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world\nsettings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces\nMoir\\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study\nsystematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on\nMoir\\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We\ncollected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,\nDFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world\nconditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera\nangles. To further examine the influence of Moir\\'e patterns on deepfake\ndetection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\\'eFake,\nreferred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\\'e generation techniques.\nAcross 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\\'e artifacts\ndegrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\\'e\npatterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\\'eing methods,\nintended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing\naccuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for\ndetection models that can robustly handle Moir\\'e distortions alongside other\nrealworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring.

    "summary": "The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new\npossibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among\nthese, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to\nidentify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting\nprecise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting\nexample-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images\n(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of\ncapturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To\novercome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that\nunifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide\nembeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a\ncorpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained\nmorphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and\nflexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)\nmosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide\nresearch; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly\nretrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public\npathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including\nanatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,\nand grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and\nstomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional\nimage-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further\ndemonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,\nand enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical\nscenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable\nretrieval solution for digital pathology.",

We address this\nfundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which\nleverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with\nlocal proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a\nseparate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental\ninformation, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level\nunderstanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection\nparadigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive\nenvironmental information.

Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in\nenhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative\ntasks.

We review the evolution of RL from classical control\nto its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration\ninto image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not\nonly as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning\ngeneration with complex, high-level goals.

However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common\nreal-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open\nproblem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that\naddresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction\nas an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior\nscene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference\nstrategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views\nwithout additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we\nintroduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction\nacross multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy\nthat transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully\nend-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and\nimproves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new\nbenchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,\nenabling comprehensive analysis.

DECO was the first in the\nwild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and\nstruggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot\ncontacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch\nnetwork based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,\nclass-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention\nfor improved local reasoning.

    "summary": "The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming\namount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This\npresents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely\ndetection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and\nprevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is\nfundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper\ninvestigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing\nanomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing\nthe embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse\n2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs\ncan act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video\ninto text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate\nfour open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and\nprivacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some\nmodels, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially\nfull-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.\nThese results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially\nsalient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity\nobfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial\ngrounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight\nspatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,\nand privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions\nzero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for\nembodied, real-world video understanding.

    "summary": "3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered\nsignificant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object\nqueries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.\nHowever, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often\nfar from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In\nthis paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection\n(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that\nreference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.\nFurthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we\nintroduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results\nwith depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the\nnuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\\%\nin terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\\% in the NuScenes Detection\nScore (NDS).",

    "summary": "This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor\nconstructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by\nGranlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite\ndifferent--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient\nfilter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer\nproducts of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when\nboth constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares\n(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large\nextent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction\nterm introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it\nensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby\nsimplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this\ninterpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by\nreinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure\ntensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly\nfrom quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and\nnon-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,\nalthough not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor\nconstruction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,\nprovided they are sufficiently concentrated.",

    "summary": "Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create\nhigh-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for\ndownstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a\ncritical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts\nof key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises\ninstruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism\nrisks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this\nissue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework\nthat decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal\nfeatures for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic\nprompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm.

Additionally, models trained on modality-incomplete data\nare prone to overfitting. Therefore, MIAD models that demonstrate robustness\nagainst modality-incomplete data are highly desirable in practice.

However, when processing complex geometric structures in\npoint clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture\nlocal geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and\nhigh model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate\ntheir efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a\nGeometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the\nmodel's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature\nProcessing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and\nglobal context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and\noverall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the\nGlobal Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive\nfield gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric\ninformation of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and\ncomputational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the\nPointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while\nmaintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN\noutperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,\nand ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning\ntask.

Although global products such\nas the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef\ndistri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision\nand semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary\ndelineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel\nse-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under\nnoisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN\narchitecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)\nblock in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic\nstructures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a\ncoral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming\nconventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting.

    "summary": "Disparity compensation represents the primary strategy in stereo video\ncompression (SVC) for exploiting cross-view redundancy. These mechanisms can be\nbroadly categorized into two types: one that employs explicit horizontal\nshifting, and another that utilizes an implicit cross-attention mechanism to\nreduce cross-view disparity redundancy. In this work, we propose a hybrid\ndisparity compensation (HDC) strategy that leverages explicit pixel\ndisplacement as a robust prior feature to simplify optimization and perform\nimplicit cross-attention mechanisms for subsequent warping operations, thereby\ncapturing a broader range of disparity information. Specifically, HDC first\ncomputes a similarity map by fusing the horizontally shifted cross-view\nfeatures to capture pixel displacement information. This similarity map is then\nnormalized into an \"explicit pixel-wise attention score\" to perform the\ncross-attention mechanism, implicitly aligning features from one view to\nanother. Building upon HDC, we introduce a novel end-to-end optimized neural\nstereo video compression framework, which integrates HDC-based modules into key\ncoding operations, including cross-view feature extraction and reconstruction\n(HDC-FER) and cross-view entropy modeling (HDC-EM).

To address these issues, we propose a unified\ngeometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three\ncore components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement\n(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based\nsparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with\nhigh precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the\nrefined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced\ngeometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest\nNeighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively\npreserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the\ndecoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a\nweighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of\nhigh-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.\nUGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:\n8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB.

Quantization offers a promising solution by\nreducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that\nthe joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion\nmodels (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high\ncalibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we\npropose S$^2$Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for V-DMs that\nleverages Salient data and Sparse token distillation.

More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder\nlogits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,\nconcatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of\nsynthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss\nweight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step\narchitecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,\nmixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures\n(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset\nimproves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep\nsupervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero\ninference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled\nscans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.\nAcross four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up\nto +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted\nmixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully\ninterpretable, and overhead-free at inference.

We propose\nSceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene\nPlanning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a\n``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain\nlong-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,\nhighlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,\nand games.",

To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic\noccupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.\nIts scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but\nalso autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we\ndevelop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic\noccupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds.

While many efforts have focused on\ndetecting swapped face images or videos, these methods are insufficient for\ntracing the malicious users behind fraudulent activities.

To address these challenges, we introduce FaceTracer,\nthe first non-intrusive framework specifically designed to trace the identity\nof the source person from swapped face images or videos. Specifically,\nFaceTracer leverages a disentanglement module that effectively suppresses\nidentity information related to the target person while isolating the identity\nfeatures of the source person.

    "summary": "U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image\nsegmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and\nlow-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections\nexhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature\nconstraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of\nfeature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is\ntransmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The\nintra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale\nfeature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global\ncontextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\nDynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer\nconnectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two\ncomplementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module\naddresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden\nrepresentations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature\nrefinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the\nintra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on\nglobal contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature\nintegration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly\nincorporated into existing U-like network structures.

    "summary": "Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong\npotential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a\nsingle textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and\ndomains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately\ncapturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise\nadaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and\nlearnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping\nall visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns\neach token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual\ncharacteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each\ntoken is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We\ninstead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal\nsubspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination\nguided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient\ntoken-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an\noptimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported\nto textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of\nOT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus\non different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that\nadaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces.

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image\nsegmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a\nconvolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a\nvision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed\nframework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed\nby segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,\npixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular\nvalue decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered\nusing hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The\nnumber of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular\nvalues. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded\ninto image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text\nembeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific\nprompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set\nrecognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into\na shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.\nRecognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between\nthe projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on\nstandard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and\nF1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and\ngeneralizability of the proposed framework.",

    "summary": "Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive\nhuman-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.\nState-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting\nto efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled\nfrom high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently\noffset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for\nfeature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck\nthat hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,\nthat eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a\ngeneralized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet\ndataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent\nspace for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific\ntraining. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction\nprocess achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance\ncomparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our\ndesign choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the\noptimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity\nusing Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and\nreprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings.

In neural and physical\nsystems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled\noscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for\nstructured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs\n\\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally\ncoupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase,\ngradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The\nreverse process then performs \\textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse\npatterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach\nenables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical\ngeneration process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale\ndetails. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware\nnetworks to account for the circular geometry.

    "summary": "With the rapid development of large multimodal models (LMMs), multimodal\nunderstanding applications are emerging. As most LMM inference requests\noriginate from edge devices with limited computational capabilities, the\npredominant inference pipeline involves directly forwarding the input data to\nan edge server which handles all computations. However, this approach\nintroduces high transmission latency due to limited uplink bandwidth of edge\ndevices and significant computation latency caused by the prohibitive number of\nvisual tokens, thus hindering delay-sensitive tasks and degrading user\nexperience. To address this challenge, we propose a task-oriented feature\ncompression (TOFC) method for multimodal understanding in a device-edge\nco-inference framework, where visual features are merged by clustering and\nencoded by a learnable and selective entropy model before feature projection.\nSpecifically, we employ density peaks clustering based on K nearest neighbors\nto reduce the number of visual features, thereby minimizing both data\ntransmission and computational complexity. Subsequently, a learnable entropy\nmodel with hyperprior is utilized to encode and decode merged features, further\nreducing transmission overhead. To enhance compression efficiency, multiple\nentropy models are adaptively selected based on the characteristics of the\nvisual features, enabling a more accurate estimation of the probability\ndistribution. Comprehensive experiments on seven visual question answering\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFC method. Results show\nthat TOFC achieves up to 52% reduction in data transmission overhead and 63%\nreduction in system latency while maintaining identical task performance,\ncompared with neural compression ELIC.",

Such facts, as we observed, stem\nfrom the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that\nencode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text\nprompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a\nnull-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \\textbf{NTN-Diff}, for\ntext-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across\nmasked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,\nwhile preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.\nBased on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into\nearly (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the\nmid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process.

    "summary": "Real-world objects are composed of distinctive, object-specific parts.\nIdentifying these parts is key to performing fine-grained, compositional\nreasoning-yet, large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to perform this\nseemingly straightforward task. In this work, we introduce PARTONOMY, an LMM\nbenchmark designed for pixel-level part grounding. We construct PARTONOMY from\nexisting part datasets and our own rigorously annotated set of images,\nencompassing 862 part labels and 534 object labels for evaluation. Unlike\nexisting datasets that simply ask models to identify generic parts, PARTONOMY\nuses specialized concepts (e.g., agricultural airplane), and challenges models\nto compare objects' parts, consider part-whole relationships, and justify\ntextual predictions with visual segmentations. Our experiments demonstrate\nsignificant limitations in state-of-the-art LMMs (e.g., LISA-13B achieves only\n5.9% gIoU), highlighting a critical gap in their part grounding abilities. We\nnote that existing segmentation-enabled LMMs (segmenting LMMs) have two key\narchitectural shortcomings: they use special [SEG] tokens not seen during\npretraining which induce distribution shift, and they discard predicted\nsegmentations instead of using past predictions to guide future ones. To\naddress these deficiencies, we train several part-centric LMMs and propose\nPLUM, a novel segmenting LMM that uses span tagging instead of segmentation\ntokens and that conditions on prior predictions in a feedback loop. We find\nthat pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on reasoning\nsegmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination benchmarks. In addition, PLUM\nfinetuned on our proposed Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive\nwith segmenting LMMs trained on significantly more segmentation data. Our work\nopens up new avenues towards enabling fine-grained, grounded visual\nunderstanding in LMMs.",

    "summary": "Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a\nunified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at\ncorresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long\ntraining times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We\nintroduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the\ncomputational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise\nmatches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid\nnonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and\ninter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and\naggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography\nparameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,\nthat eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted\ntransformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated\nwith such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.\nExperimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves\nresults better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,\nwhile reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds.

In this paper, we propose Segment then Splat,\na 3D-aware open vocabulary segmentation approach for both static and dynamic\nscenes based on Gaussian Splatting. Segment then Splat reverses the long\nestablished approach of \"segmentation after reconstruction\" by dividing\nGaussians into distinct object sets before reconstruction. Once reconstruction\nis complete, the scene is naturally segmented into individual objects,\nachieving true 3D segmentation. This design eliminates both geometric and\nsemantic ambiguities, as well as Gaussian-object misalignment issues in dynamic\nscenes.

Nevertheless, adapting\nto a target subject presents significant challenges due to large distributional\ndifferences between source and target domains, often resulting in negative\ntransfer. In addition, integrating all sources simultaneously increases\ncomputational costs and causes misalignment with the target. To address these\nissues, we propose a progressive MSDA approach that gradually introduces\ninformation from subjects based on their similarity to the target subject.

    "summary": "Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated\nstrong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly\nvulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and\ncompromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial\nfine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot\nsettings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP\nadversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view\nvariations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective\ntest-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic\nconsistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and\nmulti-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the\ntarget embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning\nperturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under\nadversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play\ninference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack\nsettings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP\nwhile maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs\nfor further gains.

When the time horizon $T$ is\nat least exponential in the embedding dimension $d$, one can learn the geometry\nof the class regions: in this regime, we propose the Conservative Hull-based\nClassifier (CHC), which maintains convex hulls of expert-labeled queries and\ncalls the expert as soon as a query lands outside all known hulls.

    "summary": "Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for\ntransferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student\nmodels, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in\nresource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to\ngraph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to\ngenerate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related\ninformation. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by\nexploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of\na pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN\narchitectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing\nbetter during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a\ncollaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach\neach other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit\nweighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an\nentropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components\ndynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during\ntraining, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "summary": "Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools\nfor analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across\ndiverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability\nof these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph\nstructure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and\ndeployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we\nstudy how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a\nnovel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that\nfocus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation\ncharacterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This\nway, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on\nthe interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and\nperturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to\nvalidate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing\nbaselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on\ndownstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the\nproposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data\ndistribution into stability analysis.",

Our framework unifies\nRiesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning, covariate balancing,\ntargeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and density-ratio estimation. In\nmany problems involving causal effects or structural models, the parameters of\ninterest depend on regression functions. Plugging regression functions\nestimated by machine learning methods into the identifying equations can yield\npoor performance because of first-stage bias. To reduce such bias, debiased\nmachine learning employs Neyman orthogonal estimating equations. Debiased\nmachine learning typically requires estimation of the Riesz representer and the\nregression function. For this problem, we develop a direct debiased machine\nlearning framework with an end-to-end algorithm. We formulate estimation of the\nnuisance parameters, the regression function and the Riesz representer, as\nminimizing the discrepancy between Neyman orthogonal scores computed with known\nand unknown nuisance parameters, which we refer to as Neyman targeted\nestimation. Neyman targeted estimation includes Riesz representer estimation,\nand we measure discrepancies using the Bregman divergence. The Bregman\ndivergence encompasses various loss functions as special cases, where the\nsquared loss yields Riesz regression and the Kullback-Leibler divergence yields\nentropy balancing. We refer to this Riesz representer estimation as generalized\nRiesz regression. Neyman targeted estimation also yields TMLE as a special case\nfor regression function estimation.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of collaborative inference\nin wireless edge networks, where energy-constrained edge devices aim to\ncomplete inference tasks within given deadlines. These tasks are carried out\nusing neural networks, and the edge device seeks to optimize inference\nperformance under energy and delay constraints. The inference process can be\nsplit between the edge device and an edge server, thereby achieving\ncollaborative inference over wireless networks. We formulate an inference\nutility optimization problem subject to energy and delay constraints, and\npropose a novel solution called Bayes-Split-Edge, which leverages Bayesian\noptimization for collaborative split inference over wireless edge networks. Our\nsolution jointly optimizes the transmission power and the neural network split\npoint.

We evaluate our approach using the VGG19 model\non the ImageNet-Mini dataset, and Resnet101 on Tiny-ImageNet, and real-world\nmMobile wireless channel datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that\nBayes-Split-Edge achieves up to 2.4x reduction in evaluation cost compared to\nstandard Bayesian optimization and achieves near-linear convergence.

To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like\ninitialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial\nimprovements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of\ncPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce\nResidual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in\ndeep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical\ntests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully\ntraverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the\ndiffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward\nPDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components\ndemonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and\nPirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in\nsettings where the others diverge.",

To validate such\njudge systems, evaluators assess human--judge agreement by first collecting\nmultiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, then aggregating\nthe ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. For many items, however,\nrating criteria may admit multiple valid interpretations, so a human or LLM\nrater may deem multiple ratings \"reasonable\" or \"correct.\" We call this\ncondition rating indeterminacy. Problematically, many rating tasks that contain\nrating indeterminacy rely on forced-choice elicitation, whereby raters are\ninstructed to select only one rating for each item. In this paper, we introduce\na framework for validating LLM-as-a-judge systems under rating indeterminacy.\nWe draw theoretical connections between different measures of judge system\nperformance under different human--judge agreement metrics, and different\nrating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We demonstrate that differences in\nhow humans and LLMs resolve rating indeterminacy when responding to\nforced-choice rating instructions can heavily bias LLM-as-a-judge validation.\nThrough extensive experiments involving 11 real-world rating tasks and 9\ncommercial LLMs, we show that standard validation approaches that rely upon\nforced-choice ratings select judge systems that are highly suboptimal,\nperforming as much as 31% worse than judge systems selected by our approach\nthat uses multi-label \"response set\" ratings to account for rating\nindeterminacy.

A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as\nfew simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work,\nwe address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models\nfor tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN\n-- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for\nSBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks\n(NPE-PFN) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms\nof accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse\nproblems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of\nsimulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer\nsimulations.

    "title": "Adaptive Dual Prompting: Hierarchical Debiasing for Fairness-aware Graph\n  Neural Networks",
    "summary": "In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through\nself-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely\nadopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for\npre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between\npre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts\npre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable\nprompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph\nprompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,\nthey often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In\nfact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations\nacross demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains\nbiases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we\npropose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness\nfor adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute\nbias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized\nattribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,\nreducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message\nCalibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust\nthe message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of\nthe information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting\nmodules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct\nextensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to\nevaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed\nADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.",

    "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves\nprivacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its\nprototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled\nby analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \\emph{over-the-air\nFL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \\emph{frenemy}\nin the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while\nproviding a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,\nformally quantified by \\emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,\nnevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as\nprior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted\ntypes of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a\nsingle-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study\nAirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station\n(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which\nclaimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to\nensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as\na \\emph{perk} even \\emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a\nnovel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on\nmodel parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and\nnon-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power\nallocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which\nalso reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising\ntraining. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive\nnumerical results.",

    "summary": "In multi-objective black-box optimization, the goal is typically to find\nsolutions that optimize a set of $T$ black-box objective functions, $f_1,\n\\ldots f_T$, simultaneously. Traditional approaches often seek a single\nPareto-optimal set that balances trade-offs among all objectives. In contrast,\nwe consider a problem setting that departs from this paradigm: finding a small\nset of $K < T$ solutions, that collectively \"cover\" the $T$ objectives. A set\nof solutions is defined as \"covering\" if, for each objective $f_1, \\ldots f_T$,\nthere is at least one good solution. A motivating example for this problem\nsetting occurs in drug design. For example, we may have $T$ pathogens and aim\nto identify a set of $K < T$ antibiotics such that at least one antibiotic can\nbe used to treat each pathogen. This problem, known as coverage optimization,\nhas yet to be tackled with the Bayesian optimization (BO) framework. To fill\nthis void, we develop Multi-Objective Coverage Bayesian Optimization (MOCOBO),\na BO algorithm for solving coverage optimization. Our approach is based on a\nnew acquisition function reminiscent of expected improvement in the vanilla BO\nsetup. We demonstrate the performance of our method on high-dimensional\nblack-box optimization tasks, including applications in peptide and molecular\ndesign. Results show that the coverage of the $K < T$ solutions found by MOCOBO\nmatches or nearly matches the coverage of $T$ solutions obtained by optimizing\neach objective individually.

But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous\nenvironments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile\nor slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning\nalgorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning\nshows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when\nformulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)\nare unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;\n2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with\nvariable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board\ndeployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a\nnovel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and\ndevelop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and\nAttention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple\nexample of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the\ntime) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic\nsolver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi.

Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes,\nachieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents\nbackward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally\nchallenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two\nvariational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model.\nIn this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural\nnetwork-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly\nutilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the\nupstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis\nand reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for\nthe upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional\nvariational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional\ncut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all\nthe upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut\nestimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data\nregime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution,\nquantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the\ntarget cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we\nestablish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of\nconditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses\nillustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over\ntraditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than\nparametric variational cut approaches.",

    "summary": "Evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires diverse,\nsafety-critical scenarios, with collisions being especially important yet rare\nand unsafe to collect in the real world. Therefore, the community has been\nfocusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation. However,\ncontrolling attributes such as collision type and time-to-accident (TTA)\nremains challenging. We introduce a new task called controllable collision\nscenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a\nuser-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of\nautomatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we\npresent COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by\ntransforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across\nfive representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a\nframework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable\nrepresentation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the\nadversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial\ntrajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines\nin both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios\nconsistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of\nexisting planners. We demonstrate that these scenarios fine-tune planners for\nrobustness improvements, contributing to safer AV deployment in different\ncollision scenarios.

    "summary": "The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to\nmathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in\nthe reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite\nits success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning\nfine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in\ndecreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance\nduring Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on\noptimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive\nan unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric.\nFurthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common\nelement in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.\nEmpirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in\noff-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.",

By aligning\nthese properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property\ncorrelations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false\nnegatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability,\nGATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to\nthe discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent\nreal-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening\nbillions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for\npractical deployment.

    "summary": "While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling\nrelational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way\nrelationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to\nthis, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial\nrepresentations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate\nhigher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through\nHigher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \\emph{scalability\nchallenges} due to \\textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing\nroutes, and \\textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation\nmechanism.

Instead, HOPSE breaks\n\\emph{arbitrary higher-order domains} into their neighborhood relationships\nusing a Hasse graph decomposition. This method shows that decoupling the\nrepresentation learning of neighborhood topology from that of attributes\nresults in lower computational complexity, casting doubt on the need for HOMP.\nThe experiments on molecular graph tasks and topological benchmarks show that\nHOPSE matches performance on traditional TDL datasets and outperforms HOMP\nmethods on topological tasks, achieving up to $7\\times$ speedups over\nHOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.",

This design,\naugmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not\nonly improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise\nimmunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration\nand derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded\ninto a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the\npower of deep learning.

    "summary": "When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters\nsimultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's\nweights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using\ndifferent adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to\nbe separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the\nLoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base\nmodel's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA\nsharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in\ntheory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain\ncertain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way\nof sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication\nfor the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our\nblock-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA\n(i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream\nperformance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA.\nFor example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x)\nend-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for\nLlama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x)\nthe number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.",

The\nmodel demonstrated an overall F1-score of 97.6% for abnormal data and 99.4% for\nnormal data, signifying its high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and\nanomalous sensor data. Regarding the anomaly classification, GRAD successfully\ncategorized different anomaly types with high precision, enabling the recovery\nmodule to accurately restore damaged sensor data.

Additionally, we shed light on the fact that\nthe unbalanced situation allows two meaningful definitions of multi-task risk,\ndepending on whether all tasks should be considered equally important or if\nsample-rich tasks should receive more weight than sample-poor ones.",

    "summary": "Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and\nnon-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily\ndisturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering\nresults. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via\nGravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a\ngroup-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points\ninto collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based\ncontraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood\ntopology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups\nand their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.\nUsing groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy\nensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments\non multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11\nrepresentative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,\n52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,\nwhile maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results\nhighlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing\nboundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data\ndistributions.",

Collaborative\nlearning (CL) -- techniques that enable multiple parties to train models\njointly without sharing raw data -- offers a principled approach to this\nchallenge. However, existing CL frameworks (e.g., federated and split learning)\nremain limited in real-world deployments. Current CL benchmarks and algorithms\nprimarily target the learning step under assumptions of isolated, aligned, and\njoinable databases, and they typically neglect the end-to-end data management\npipeline, especially preprocessing steps such as table joins and data\nalignment. In contrast, our analysis of the real-world corpus WikiDBs shows\nthat databases are interconnected, unaligned, and sometimes unjoinable,\nexposing a significant gap between CL algorithm design and practical\ndeployment. To close this evaluation gap, we build WikiDBGraph, a large-scale\ndataset constructed from 100{,}000 real-world relational databases linked by 17\nmillion weighted edges. Each node (database) and edge (relationship) is\nannotated with 13 and 12 properties, respectively, capturing a hybrid of\ninstance- and feature-level overlap across databases. Experiments on\nWikiDBGraph demonstrate both the effectiveness and limitations of existing CL\nmethods under realistic conditions, highlighting previously overlooked gaps in\nmanaging real-world data silos and pointing to concrete directions for\npractical deployment of collaborative learning systems.",

In the last ten years, the fluid mechanics community\nhas widely adopted reinforcement learning, often in the form of its simplest\nimplementations, to address this challenge. But it is unclear how good are the\nstrategies learned by these algorithms. In this paper, we perform a\nquantitative assessment of reinforcement learning methods applied to navigation\nin partially observable flows. We first introduce a well-posed problem of\ndirectional navigation for which a quasi-optimal policy is known analytically.\nWe then report on the poor performance and robustness of commonly used\nalgorithms (Q-Learning, Advantage Actor Critic) in flows regularly encountered\nin the literature: Taylor-Green vortices, Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, and\ntwo-dimensional turbulence. We show that they are vastly surpassed by PPO\n(Proximal Policy Optimization), a more advanced algorithm that has established\ndominance across a wide range of benchmarks in the reinforcement learning\ncommunity. In particular, our custom implementation of PPO matches the\ntheoretical quasi-optimal performance in turbulent flow and does so in a robust\nmanner.

    "summary": "We introduce a novel class of score-based diffusion processes that operate\ndirectly in the representation space of Lie groups. Leveraging the framework of\nGeneralized Score Matching, we derive a class of Langevin dynamics that\ndecomposes as a direct sum of Lie algebra representations, enabling the\nmodeling of any target distribution on any (non-Abelian) Lie group. Standard\nscore-matching emerges as a special case of our framework when the Lie group is\nthe translation group. We prove that our generalized generative processes arise\nas solutions to a new class of paired stochastic differential equations (SDEs),\nintroduced here for the first time. We validate our approach through\nexperiments on diverse data types, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nreal-world applications such as SO(3)-guided molecular conformer generation and\nmodeling ligand-specific global SE(3) transformations for molecular docking,\nshowing improvement in comparison to Riemannian diffusion on the group itself.\nWe show that an appropriate choice of Lie group enhances learning efficiency by\nreducing the effective dimensionality of the trajectory space and enables the\nmodeling of transitions between complex data distributions.",

    "summary": "Physics-informed statistical learning (PISL) integrates empirical data with\nphysical knowledge to enhance the statistical performance of estimators. While\nPISL methods are widely used in practice, a comprehensive theoretical\nunderstanding of how informed regularization affects statistical properties is\nstill missing. Specifically, two fundamental questions have yet to be fully\naddressed: (1) what is the trade-off between considering soft penalties versus\nhard constraints, and (2) what is the statistical gain of incorporating\nphysical knowledge compared to purely data-driven empirical error minimisation.\nIn this paper, we address these questions for PISL in convex classes of\nfunctions under physical knowledge expressed as linear equations by developing\nappropriate complexity dependent error rates based on the small-ball method. We\nshow that, under suitable assumptions, (1) the error rates of physics-informed\nestimators are comparable to those of hard constrained empirical error\nminimisers, differing only by constant terms, and that (2) informed\npenalization can effectively reduce model complexity, akin to dimensionality\nreduction, thereby improving learning performance. This work establishes a\ntheoretical framework for evaluating the statistical properties of\nphysics-informed estimators in convex classes of functions, contributing to\nclosing the gap between statistical theory and practical PISL, with potential\napplications to cases not yet explored in the literature.",

    "summary": "Probabilistic models must be well calibrated to support reliable\ndecision-making. While calibration in single-output regression is well studied,\ndefining and achieving multivariate calibration in multi-output regression\nremains considerably more challenging. The existing literature on multivariate\ncalibration primarily focuses on diagnostic tools based on pre-rank functions,\nwhich are projections that reduce multivariate prediction-observation pairs to\nunivariate summaries to detect specific types of miscalibration. In this work,\nwe go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to\nenforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank\nfunctions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest\ndensity region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces\ncalibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral\ntransforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a\nregularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor.\nSpecifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both\nmarginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration. We also introduce a new\nPCA-based pre-rank that captures calibration along directions of maximal\nvariance in the predictive distribution, while also enabling dimensionality\nreduction. Across 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that\nunregularized models are consistently miscalibrated, and that our methods\nsignificantly improve calibration across all pre-rank functions without\nsacrificing predictive accuracy.",

However, current datasets are limited by the trade-off between\nacoustic realism and scalability. Measured corpora provide faithful physics but\nare expensive, low-coverage, and rarely include paired clean and reverberant\ndata. In contrast, most simulation-based datasets rely on simplified\ngeometrical acoustics, thus failing to reproduce key physical phenomena like\ndiffraction, scattering, and interference that govern sound propagation in\ncomplex environments. We introduce Treble10, a large-scale, physically accurate\nroom-acoustic dataset. Treble10 contains over 3000 broadband room impulse\nresponses (RIRs) simulated in 10 fully furnished real-world rooms, using a\nhybrid simulation paradigm implemented in the Treble SDK that combines a\nwave-based and geometrical acoustics solver. The dataset provides six\ncomplementary subsets, spanning mono, 8th-order Ambisonics, and 6-channel\ndevice RIRs, as well as pre-convolved reverberant speech scenes paired with\nLibriSpeech utterances. All signals are simulated at 32 kHz, accurately\nmodelling low-frequency wave effects and high-frequency reflections. Treble10\nbridges the realism gap between measurement and simulation, enabling\nreproducible, physically grounded evaluation and large-scale data augmentation\nfor far-field speech tasks.

    "summary": "Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas.\nOutliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human\nerror, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform\noutlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers\nand build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier\ndetection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal\noutlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier\ndetection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of\ndomain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed\nto represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify\noutliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an\nadvantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are\nfounded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been\nevaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from\ntwo different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying\nbalance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a\nneurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate\nthe proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in\nterms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal\nis useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false\npositive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.",

Most habitats face mounting pressures from human activities, which\nrequires accurate, high-resolution habitat mapping for effective conservation\nand restoration. Yet, current habitat maps often fall short in thematic or\nspatial resolution because they must (1) model several mutually exclusive\nhabitat types that co-occur across landscapes and (2) cope with severe class\nimbalance that complicates exhaustive multi-class training. Here, we evaluated\nhow high-resolution remote sensing (RS) data and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ntools can improve habitat mapping across large geographical extents at fine\nspatial and thematic resolution. Using vegetation plots from the European\nVegetation Archive, we modelled the distribution of Level 3 EUNIS habitat types\nacross Europe and assessed multiple modelling strategies against independent\nvalidation datasets. Strategies that exploited the hierarchical nature of\nhabitat classifications resolved classification ambiguities, especially in\nfragmented habitats.

Our\ntheoretical analysis reveals how the interplay between emulator inductive\nbiases, training objectives, and numerical error characteristics enables\nsuperior performance during multi-step rollouts.

To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel\n''model MoE-ization'' strategy that leads to a conflict- and oblivion-resistant\nmulti-task adaptation method.

Accordingly, the weight matrix\nbecomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert\ncorresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the\ncorresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a\nlearnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors.

While prior work in this setting\nhas focused exclusively on worst-case analysis, we initiate the study of\nbest-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms that achieve low regret in both\nstochastic and adversarial environments. We propose the first BOBW algorithms\nfor episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known\ntransitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings\nand ${O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish\nmatching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this\nsetting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by\nincorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of\nFTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators\ninspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems. Along the way, we\nalso provide the first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and demonstrate\nnear-optimal BOBW algorithms for shortest path problems with bandit feedback.",

    "summary": "Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing\n(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,\ntask offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service\n(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from\nlimited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among\nUAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with\nstringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated\ngraph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses\nthese challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer\ndynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal\ndependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships\nand collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop\na dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous\ntrajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a\nreputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with\ngradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust\nknowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%\nIoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.\nScalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,\nIoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical\napplicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.",

In massive and dynamic data streams, a central\nchallenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural\nproperties of the data while enabling efficient queries.\n  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear\nspace and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of\ndata. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a\nsublinear sketch that requires only $\\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\\rho-\\eta})$ memory by\nstoring only a sublinear ($n^{-\\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where\n$\\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\\eta<1$.

Furthermore, the server employs\nnormalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness\nand mitigate client drift.

This design provides bespoke controllability: users\nmay decide which semantic factors to retain explicitly in the latent space,\nwhile the complementary information remains recoverable through the flow\nnetwork. Coupled flow matching builds on two components: (i) an extended\nGromov-Wasserstein optimal transport objective that establishes a probabilistic\ncorrespondence between data and embeddings, and (ii) a dual-conditional\nflow-matching network that extrapolates the correspondence to the underlying\nspace.

    "summary": "The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon\nand Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their\ngeneralization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform\ncompetitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate\nsimplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a\ntestbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is\nSpectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\\Sigma\nV^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we\nidentify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD\noutperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both\nlinear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning\ndominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal\ncomponents of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a\ngrowing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further\nshow that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive\nstep-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,\nwe show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our\ntheoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments\ncompare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against\ntheir Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that\nthese spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more\nbalanced learning of the data's underlying components.",

However, the training\nperspective, especially its training dynamic, is underexplored. In AIMC\nhardware, the trainable weights are represented by the conductance of resistive\nelements and updated using consecutive electrical pulses. While the conductance\nchanges by a constant in response to each pulse, in reality, the change is\nscaled by asymmetric and non-linear response functions, leading to a non-ideal\ntraining dynamic. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for\ngradient-based training on AIMC hardware with non-ideal response functions. We\ndemonstrate that asymmetric response functions negatively impact Analog SGD by\nimposing an implicit penalty on the objective. To overcome the issue, we\npropose Residual Learning algorithm, which provably converges exactly to a\ncritical point by solving a bilevel optimization problem. We demonstrate that\nthe proposed method can be extended to address other hardware imperfections,\nsuch as limited response granularity.

    "title": "CIVIL: Causal and Intuitive Visual Imitation Learning",
    "summary": "Today's robots attempt to learn new tasks by imitating human examples. These\nrobots watch the human complete the task, and then try to match the actions\ntaken by the human expert. However, this standard approach to visual imitation\nlearning is fundamentally limited: the robot observes what the human does, but\nnot why the human chooses those behaviors. Without understanding which features\nof the system or environment factor into the human's decisions, robot learners\noften misinterpret the human's examples. In practice, this results in causal\nconfusion, inefficient learning, and robot policies that fail when the\nenvironment changes. We therefore propose a shift in perspective: instead of\nasking human teachers just to show what actions the robot should take, we also\nenable humans to intuitively indicate why they made those decisions. Under our\nparadigm human teachers attach markers to task-relevant objects and use natural\nlanguage prompts to describe their state representation. Our proposed\nalgorithm, CIVIL, leverages this augmented demonstration data to filter the\nrobot's visual observations and extract a feature representation that aligns\nwith the human teacher. CIVIL then applies these causal features to train a\ntransformer-based policy that -- when tested on the robot -- is able to emulate\nhuman behaviors without being confused by visual distractors or irrelevant\nitems. Our simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that robots\ntrained with CIVIL learn both what actions to take and why to take those\nactions, resulting in better performance than state-of-the-art baselines. From\nthe human's perspective, our user study reveals that this new training paradigm\nactually reduces the total time required for the robot to learn the task, and\nalso improves the robot's performance in previously unseen scenarios.

AL has been demonstrated to improve\nperformance across multiple domains, including navigation, image\nclassification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need\nfor labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain\nexpertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this\nissue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can\ncreate helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques\nrely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased\ncode complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an\nRL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an\nRL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a\ntraining set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the\nperformance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal\nstrategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point.

We also investigate methodologies for integrating new datasets,\nsuch as AQCat25, with the broader Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset to create\nspin-aware models without sacrificing generalizability.

In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper\ndecision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four\nformal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four\ngeneric algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees\nsatisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties\nof hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial\nhypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.\n  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the\nalgorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the\nfirst hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our\nknowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to\nhyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on\ngeneral-purpose solvers.

However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the\nfew-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation\nmethods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic\nproperty of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models\n(USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still\nsuffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we\npropose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only\nnoise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level\nperformance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we\nintroduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired\nnegative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in\ngeneration quality.",

    "summary": "Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks,\nrelying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions\nover a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete,\ndifficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a\nflexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data.\nHowever, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and\nstability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To\naddress these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft\nattitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven\napproaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network\narchitecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on\nsimulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies\nwere considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant\nto improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion\nof physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of\nthe mean relative error with the best architectures found by 27.08%. These\nadvantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into\nan MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely\ndata-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, and\nachieve improved settling times when compared to traditional MPC approaches,\nyielding improvements of up to 62%, when subject to observation noise and RWs\nfriction.",

    "summary": "Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and\ngalaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep\nlearning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling\nacross undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can\nguard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between\nequivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model\ncalibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and\nregression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is\nnatural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the\nrelationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we\npresent a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving\nlower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under\nvarious equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of\nequivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in\nmiscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our\ntheoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship\nbetween equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated\ndatasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.",

Objective: To\nassess technical feasibility and clinician-relevant signals of a sensor-fused\nwearable targeting the triceps brachii and extensor pollicis brevis. Methods: A\nlightweight node integrates surface EMG (1 kHz), IMU (100--200 Hz), and\nflex/force sensors with on-device INT8 inference (Tiny 1D-CNN/Transformer) and\na safety-bounded assist policy (angle/torque/jerk limits; stall/time-out).\nHealthy adults (n = 12) performed three ADL-like tasks.

Analyses used\nsubject-level paired medians with BCa 95\\% CIs; exact Wilcoxon $p$-values are\nreported in the Results.

We propose a discretized approach where we find many\ndiscrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible\ncounterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\\textit{Segmented\nSampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find\ndecision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.\nAcross four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can\noutperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in\ndistance between $5\\%$ to $50\\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can\nalso handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and\ncategorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related\ncharacteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of\nruntime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple\norders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based\napproach.

The emergence of\nnext-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,\noffers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard\nprocessing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of\nextensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the\ndevelopment of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset\nexplicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing\ndiverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to\nidentify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as\ntemperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations\noffer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,\naddressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we\npresent comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish\nbaselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for\ndeploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel\nMovidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic\nactivity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces\nlatency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning\nsystems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster\nmanagement, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard\nmonitoring technologies.",

This results in misaligned\nlocal feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model\naggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets\nwithout missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features\nacross clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each\nclient observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing\ninput features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in\nlearned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework\nfeaturing locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side\nembedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.\n  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally\naggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more\neffective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be\nalgorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to\nenhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global\nrepresentation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks\nwith diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of\nthe proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\\% performance improvement under\nsevere data incompleteness.

    "title": "Scaling Down, Serving Fast: Compressing and Deploying Efficient LLMs for\n  Recommendation Systems",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across\na wide range of industrial applications, from search and recommendation systems\nto generative tasks. Although scaling laws indicate that larger models\ngenerally yield better generalization and performance, their substantial\ncomputational requirements often render them impractical for many real-world\nscenarios at scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of insights\nfor training and deploying small language models (SLMs) that deliver high\nperformance for a variety of industry use cases. We focus on two key\ntechniques: (1) knowledge distillation and (2) model compression via structured\npruning and quantization. These approaches enable SLMs to retain much of the\nquality of their larger counterparts while significantly reducing\ntraining/serving costs and latency. We detail the impact of these techniques on\na variety of use cases in a large professional social network platform and\nshare deployment lessons, including hardware optimization strategies that\nimprove speed and throughput for both predictive and reasoning-based\napplications in Recommendation Systems.",

    "summary": "Reliable long-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is critical for public\nhealth early-warning systems, yet existing deep learning approaches struggle to\nmaintain prediction stability beyond 48 hours, especially in cities with sparse\nmonitoring networks. This paper presents a deep learning framework that\ncombines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for intelligent station similarity\nselection with a CNN-GRU architecture to enable extended-horizon PM2.5\nforecasting in Isfahan, Iran, a city characterized by complex pollution\ndynamics and limited monitoring coverage. Unlike existing approaches that rely\non computationally intensive transformer models or external simulation tools,\nour method integrates three key innovations: (i) DTW-based historical sampling\nto identify similar pollution patterns across peer stations, (ii) a lightweight\nCNN-GRU architecture augmented with meteorological features, and (iii) a\nscalable design optimized for sparse networks. Experimental validation using\nmulti-year hourly data from eight monitoring stations demonstrates superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving R2 =\n0.91 for 24-hour forecasts. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate\nstable 10-day PM2.5 forecasting (R2 = 0.73 at 240 hours) without performance\ndegradation, addressing critical early-warning system requirements. The\nframework's computational efficiency and independence from external tools make\nit particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained urban\nenvironments.",

    "summary": "Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference\nthan autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a\ndecoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the\nfull network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key\ninsight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)\nrepresenting clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us\nto use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder\narchitecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an\nencoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively\nrefine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster\ntraining of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for\nbetter quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We\nintroduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2),\nconsisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling\nalgorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between\ngeneration quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and\nmathematical reasoning tasks.

    "summary": "Characterizing the limit behavior -- that is, the attractors -- of learning\ndynamics is one of the most fundamental open questions in game theory. In\nrecent work on this front, it was conjectured that the attractors of the\nreplicator dynamic are in one-to-one correspondence with the sink equilibria of\nthe game -- the sink strongly connected components of a game's preference graph\n-- , and it was established that they do stand in at least one-to-many\ncorrespondence with them. Here, we show that the one-to-one conjecture is\nfalse. We disprove this conjecture over the course of three theorems: the first\ndisproves a stronger form of the conjecture, while the weaker form is disproved\nseparately in the two-player and $N$-player ($N>2$) cases. By showing how the\nconjecture fails, we lay out the obstacles that lie ahead for characterizing\nattractors of the replicator, and introduce new ideas with which to tackle\nthem. All three counterexamples derive from an object called a local source --\na point lying within the sink equilibrium, and yet which is `locally\nrepelling'; we prove that the absence of local sources is necessary, but not\nsufficient, for the one-to-one property to be true. We complement this with a\nsufficient condition: we introduce a local property of a sink equilibrium\ncalled pseudoconvexity, and establish that when the sink equilibria of a\ntwo-player game are pseudoconvex then they precisely define the attractors.\nPseudoconvexity generalizes the previous cases -- such as zero-sum games and\npotential games -- where this conjecture was known to hold, and reformulates\nthese cases in terms of a simple graph property.",

    "summary": "Supply chain attacks significantly threaten software security with malicious\ncode injections within legitimate projects. Such attacks are very rare but may\nhave a devastating impact. Detecting spurious code injections using automated\ntools is further complicated as it often requires deciphering the intention of\nboth the inserted code and its context. In this study, we propose an\nunsupervised approach for highlighting spurious code injections by quantifying\ncohesion disruptions in the source code. Using a name-prediction-based cohesion\n(NPC) metric, we analyze how function cohesion changes when malicious code is\nintroduced compared to natural cohesion fluctuations. An analysis of 54,707\nfunctions over 369 open-source C++ repositories reveals that code injection\nreduces cohesion and shifts naming patterns toward shorter, less descriptive\nnames compared to genuine function updates. Considering the sporadic nature of\nreal supply-chain attacks, we evaluate the proposed method with extreme\ntest-set imbalance and show that monitoring high-cohesion functions with NPC\ncan effectively detect functions with injected code, achieving a Precision@100\nof 36.41% at a 1:1,000 ratio and 12.47% at 1:10,000.

    "summary": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular\nheterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based\non cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological\nvariability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from\ndifferent cell types can be projected close together, making accurate\nclustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework\nthat separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is\noperationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion\nprior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while\nto steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional\nobservation space. This unique \"input-space steering\" ensures the denoising\ntrajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers\nthree key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between\nprior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled\nuncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising\nby leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via\naveraging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on\nboth synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves\nclustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset\nshifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved\nbiological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries\nthat better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.",

Across balanced face-analysis benchmarks, enlarging the encoder\nreduces gender skew in CLIP but amplifies both gender and racial skew in\nOpenCLIP; increasing the LAION corpus from 400M to 2B further increases\nOpenCLIP bias. At matched model and data budgets, substituting proprietary data\nwith LAION improves gender fairness while increasing racial skew, underscoring\ndata source as the primary driver of bias patterns. We also evaluate three\npost-hoc, test-time debiasing strategies -- Bias Prompts, Prompt Array, and\nSANER. Debiasing reduces but does not eliminate harm, and its effectiveness is\nsource- and size-dependent: Bias Prompts most effectively reduce gender skew in\nCLIP at smaller model sizes, whereas Prompt Array and SANER more reliably\nreduce racial skew in OpenCLIP; scaling LAION reconfigures which method is most\nfair.

    "title": "Generalized EXTRA stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics",
    "summary": "Langevin algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian\nlearning, particularly when the aim is to sample from the posterior\ndistribution of a parametric model, given the input data and the prior\ndistribution over the model parameters. Their stochastic versions such as\nstochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) allow iterative learning based on\nrandomly sampled mini-batches of large datasets and are scalable to large\ndatasets. However, when data is decentralized across a network of agents\nsubject to communication and privacy constraints, standard SGLD algorithms\ncannot be applied. Instead, we employ decentralized SGLD (DE-SGLD) algorithms,\nwhere Bayesian learning is performed collaboratively by a network of agents\nwithout sharing individual data. Nonetheless, existing DE-SGLD algorithms\ninduce a bias at every agent that can negatively impact performance; this bias\npersists even when using full batches and is attributable to network effects.\nMotivated by the EXTRA algorithm and its generalizations for decentralized\noptimization, we propose the generalized EXTRA stochastic gradient Langevin\ndynamics, which eliminates this bias in the full-batch setting. Moreover, we\nshow that, in the mini-batch setting, our algorithm provides performance bounds\nthat significantly improve upon those of standard DE-SGLD algorithms in the\nliterature. Our numerical results also demonstrate the efficiency of the\nproposed approach.",

    "summary": "The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine\nlearning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as\nit captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the\nlearning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing\nalgorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the\nlast-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --\nespecially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)\nalgorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the\nBest-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,\nshowing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic\nbandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been\nstudied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$\nlast-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition\nthrough theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by\nthe regular function $\\Psi(p)=-4\\sum_{i=1}^{d}\\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the\nBOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point\nmass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set\nobtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.",

    "summary": "Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in\nIndian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in\npollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index\n(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,\nseasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a\nhybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA\nmodeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention\nmechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and\nresidual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed\ndeep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model\nhyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic\nOptimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient\nconvergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution\nControl Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms\nstatistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx\nin three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores\n(>0.94) for all pollutants.

    "summary": "Deep learning has shown strong performance in geospatial prediction tasks,\nbut the role of geolocation information in improving accuracy and\ngeneralizability remains underexamined. Recent work has introduced location\nencoders that aim to represent spatial context in a transferable way, yet most\nevaluations have focused on static mapping tasks. Here, we study the effect of\nincorporating geolocation into deep learning for a dynamic and spatially\nheterogeneous application: estimating daily surface-level PM2.5 across the\ncontiguous United States using satellite and ground-based observations. We\ncompare three strategies for representing location: excluding geolocation,\nusing raw latitude and longitude, and using pretrained location encoders. We\nevaluate each under within-region and out-of-region generalization settings.\nResults show that raw coordinates can improve performance within regions by\nsupporting spatial interpolation, but can reduce generalizability across\nregions. In contrast, pretrained location encoders such as GeoCLIP improve both\npredictive accuracy and geographic transfer. However, we also observe spatial\nartifacts linked to encoder characteristics, and performance varies across\nencoder types (e.g., SatCLIP vs. GeoCLIP). This work provides the first\nsystematic evaluation of location encoders in a dynamic environmental\nestimation context and offers guidance for incorporating geolocation into deep\nlearning models for geospatial prediction.",

In this work, we introduce\na unified framework-Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks-which generalizes these\nmodels to a broader family of energy functions. Our energies are formulated as\nthe difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a\ngeneralized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other\napplies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and\nnorm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable\nsparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins,\nsparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this\nframework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation,\nallowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern.\nOur framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and\nprovides an energy minimization perspective for widely used\npost-transformations like $\\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all\nthrough suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis\nas a building block.

    "summary": "We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with\nheterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time\nstep $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by\napplying the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for\nclassical Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each\npotential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link\nprobability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily\nconnected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant\ndistributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across\nagents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the\nglobal mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean\nrewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed\nalgorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip\nalgorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\\log\nT$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the\noptimal centralized regret $O\\left(\\sum_{k: \\Delta_k>0} \\frac{\\log\nT}{\\Delta_k}\\right)$ and an additional term $O\\left(\\frac{N^2 \\log T}{p\n\\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \\frac{KN^2 \\log T}{p}\\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote\nthe total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the\nimpact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link\nprobability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between\ncommunication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal\nregret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the\nsuperiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the\ntheoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.",

    "summary": "This work develops a rigorous framework for diffusion-based generative\nmodeling in the setting of free probability. We extend classical denoising\ndiffusion probabilistic models to free diffusion processes -- stochastic\ndynamics acting on noncommutative random variables whose spectral measures\nevolve by free additive convolution. The forward dynamics satisfy a free\nFokker--Planck equation that increases Voiculescu's free entropy and dissipates\nfree Fisher information, providing a noncommutative analogue of the classical\nde Bruijn identity. Using tools from free stochastic analysis, including a free\nMalliavin calculus and a Clark--Ocone representation, we derive the\nreverse-time stochastic differential equation driven by the conjugate variable,\nthe free analogue of the score function. We further develop a variational\nformulation of these flows in the free Wasserstein space, showing that the\nresulting gradient-flow structure converges to the semicircular equilibrium\nlaw. Together, these results connect modern diffusion models with the\ninformation geometry of free entropy and establish a mathematical foundation\nfor generative modeling with operator-valued or high-dimensional structured\ndata.",

    "summary": "Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In\ntransformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit\nhypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling\ncoefficient $\\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.\nHowever, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a\nstatic scaling factor $\\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide\nvariability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further\nperformance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large\nlanguage models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose\nSeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by\ndynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,\nthereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,\nself-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains\nthe ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input\nnorm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm\nand proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues\nthat may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of\nSeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as\nwell as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a\nminimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency,\nSeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously\ncommonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as\nelement-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.",

    "summary": "In recent years, video conferencing applications have become increasingly\nprevalent, relying heavily on high-speed internet connectivity. When such\nconnectivity is lacking, users often default to audio-only communication, a\nmode that significantly disadvantages American Sign Language (ASL) users, whose\ncommunication relies on hand gestures, body movement, and facial expressions.\nIn this work, we introduce VC4ASL, a system designed to enable ASL\ncommunication over the audio channel of existing video conferencing\napplications, even in the absence of reliable video. VC4ASL integrates\nseamlessly with current platforms without requiring any modifications. Our\napproach establishes a communication channel through audio by encoding and\ntransmitting human pose information, which is then rendered to reconstruct\nsigned content. We propose novel receive-side error detection and correction\nmechanisms that exploit the inherent structural constraints of human pose data.\nTo evaluate the system, we simulate network-degraded environments, generate\npose-based ASL video sequences, and conduct user studies to assess\ncomprehension among ASL users. Experimental results demonstrate that VC4ASL\neffectively facilitates intelligible ASL communication over audio in\nlow-bandwidth scenarios where video transmission is impaired.",

    "summary": "Most existing multimodal collaborative filtering recommendation (MCFRec)\nmethods rely heavily on ID features and multimodal content to enhance\nrecommendation performance. However, this paper reveals that ID features are\neffective but have limited benefits in multimodal collaborative filtering\nrecommendation. Therefore, this paper systematically deconstruct the pros and\ncons of ID features: (i) they provide initial embedding but lack semantic\nrichness, (ii) they provide a unique identifier for each user and item but\nhinder generalization to untrained data, and (iii) they assist in aligning and\nfusing multimodal features but may lead to representation shift. Based on these\ninsights, this paper proposes IDFREE, an ID-free multimodal collaborative\nFiltering REcommEndation baseline. IDFREE replaces ID features with multimodal\nfeatures and positional encodings to generate semantically meaningful ID-free\nembeddings. For ID-free multimodal collaborative filtering, it further proposes\nan adaptive similarity graph module to construct dynamic user-user and\nitem-item graphs based on multimodal features. Then, an augmented user-item\ngraph encoder is proposed to construct more effective user and item encoding.\nFinally, IDFREE achieves inter-multimodal alignment based on the contrastive\nlearning and uses Softmax loss as recommendation loss. Basic experiments on\nthree public datasets demonstrate that IDFREE outperforms existing ID-based\nMCFRec methods, achieving an average performance gain of 72.24% across standard\nmetrics (Recall@5, 10, 20, 50 and NDCG@5, 10, 20, 50). Exploratory and extended\nexperiments further validate our findings on the limitations of ID features in\nMCFRec. The code is released at https://github.com/G-H-Li/IDFREE.",

While 3DGS has recently become popular for\nnovel view synthesis, the size of trained models limits its deployment in\nbandwidth-constrained applications such as volumetric media streaming. To\naddress this, we propose a learned hierarchical latent representation that\nbuilds upon the principles of \"overfitted\" learned image compression (e.g.,\nCool-Chic and C3) to efficiently encode 3DGS attributes. Unlike images, 3DGS\ndata have irregular spatial distributions of Gaussians (geometry) and consist\nof multiple attributes (signals) defined on the irregular geometry. Our codec\nis designed to account for these differences between images and 3DGS.\nSpecifically, we leverage the octree structure of the voxelized 3DGS geometry\nto obtain a hierarchical multi-resolution representation. Our approach overfits\nlatents to each Gaussian attribute under a global rate constraint. These\nlatents are decoded independently through a lightweight decoder network. To\nestimate the bitrate during training, we employ an autoregressive probability\nmodel that leverages octree-derived contexts from the 3D point structure. The\nmulti-resolution latents, decoder, and autoregressive entropy coding networks\nare jointly optimized for each Gaussian attribute.

The flexible linear object shape has a\nclosed form solution in terms of the grasp endpoint positions and tangents,\ncalled Euler's elastica. This paper obtains the elastica solutions under the\noptimal control framework, then uses the elastica solutions to obtain\nclosed-form criteria for non self-intersection, stability and obstacle\navoidance of the flexible linear object.

Specifically, linear data-driven models have\nstruggled to control soft robots on complex, spatially extended paths that\nexplore regions with significant nonlinear behavior. To account for these\nnonlinearities, we develop here a model-predictive control strategy based on\nthe recent theory of adiabatic spectral submanifolds (aSSMs). This theory is\napplicable because the internal vibrations of heavily overdamped robots decay\nat a speed that is much faster than the desired speed of the robot along its\nintended path. In that case, low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds\n(aSSMs) emanate from the path and carry the dominant dynamics of the robot.\nAided by this recent theory, we devise an aSSM-based model-predictive control\nscheme purely from data. We demonstrate our data-driven model's effectiveness\nin tracking dynamic trajectories across diverse tasks, validated on a\nhigh-fidelity, high-dimensional finite-element model of a soft trunk robot and\na Cosserat rod-based elastic soft arm.

Existing video segmentation algorithms typically use either no\nobject-level memory (e.g. FastSAM) or they use implicit memories in the form of\nrecurrent neural network features (e.g. SAM2). In this paper, we augment both\ntypes of segmentation models using an explicit 3D memory and show that the\nresulting models have more accurate and consistent predictions. For this, we\ndevelop an online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to store predicted\nobject-level segments generated throughout the duration of a video. Based on\nthis 3DGS representation, a set of fusion techniques are developed, named\nFastSAM-Splat and SAM2-Splat, that use the explicit 3DGS memory to improve\ntheir respective foundation models' predictions. Ablation experiments are used\nto validate the proposed techniques' design and hyperparameter settings.\nResults from both real-world and simulated benchmarking experiments show that\nmodels which use explicit 3D memories result in more accurate and consistent\npredictions than those which use no memory or only implicit neural network\nmemories.

In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a\nsocially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a\nstructured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM\nconsists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that\ncaptures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the\nenvironment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a\nmulti-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot\nto generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and\nphysically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space,\ncollision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or\nfine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling\ninterpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves\nsuccess rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded\nenvironments.

    "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer\nfrom significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their\nreliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its\napplication to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of\nreal-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk\ndomains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state\nchanges that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA\napproaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to\nredundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these\nchallenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that\nreplaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual\nsimulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world\nsimulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and\n(2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides\ncontinuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated\nenvironment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their\ninitial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable\nperformance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task.\nExperiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env\neffectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and\ninefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world\ninteraction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in\nresource-constrained settings.

    "summary": "Heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators (HHMs) operate under strict physical and\nsafety-critical constraints due to their large size, high power, and complex\nnonlinear dynamics. Ensuring that both joint-level and end-effector\ntrajectories remain compliant with actuator capabilities, such as force,\nvelocity, and position limits, is essential for safe and reliable operation,\nyet remains largely underexplored in real-time control frameworks. This paper\npresents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework designed to\nguarantee constraint satisfaction throughout the full nonlinear dynamics of\nHHMs, while running at a real-time control frequency of 1 kHz. The proposed\nmethod combines a multiple-shooting strategy with real-time sensor feedback,\nand is supported by a robust low-level controller based on virtual\ndecomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking. Experimental validation\non a full-scale hydraulic manipulator shows that the NMPC framework not only\nenforces actuator constraints at the joint level, but also ensures\nconstraint-compliant motion in Cartesian space for the end-effector. These\nresults demonstrate the method's capability to deliver high-accuracy trajectory\ntracking while strictly respecting safety-critical limits, setting a new\nbenchmark for real-time control in large-scale hydraulic systems.",

This work investigates the feasibility of DRL policy\ngeneralization across visually and topographically distinct simulated domains,\nwhere policies are trained in terrestrial settings and validated in a zero-shot\nmanner in extraterrestrial environments. A 3D simulation of an agricultural\nrover is developed and trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to\nachieve goal-directed navigation and obstacle avoidance in farmland settings.\nThe learned policy is then evaluated in a lunar-like simulated environment to\nassess transfer performance. The results indicate that policies trained under\nterrestrial conditions retain a high level of effectiveness, achieving close to\n50\\% success in lunar simulations without the need for additional training and\nfine-tuning.

The capability to flexibly adjust the relative position\nbetween the multirotor and the payload has spurred growing interest in the\nsystem equipped with variable-length cable, promising broader application\npotential. Compared to systems with fixed-length cables, introducing the\nvariable-length cable adds a new degree of freedom.

    "summary": "In multi-sensor systems, time synchronization between sensors is a\nsignificant challenge, and this issue is particularly pronounced in underwater\nintegrated navigation systems incorporating acoustic positioning. Such systems\nare highly susceptible to time delay, which can significantly degrade accuracy\nwhen measurement and fusion moments are misaligned. To address this challenge,\nthis paper introduces a tightly coupled navigation framework that integrates a\npassive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) acoustic positioning system, a\nstrapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), and a depth gauge under precise\ntime synchronization. The framework fuses azimuth and slant range from the\npiUSBL with depth data, thereby avoiding poor vertical-angle observability in\nplanar arrays. A novel delay measurement strategy is introduced, combining\nsynchronized timing with acoustic signal processing, which redefines\ndelay-traditionally an unobservable error-into a quantifiable parameter,\nenabling explicit estimation of both acoustic propagation and system processing\ndelays. Simulations and field experiments confirm the feasibility of the\nproposed method, with delay-compensated navigation reducing RMSE by 40.45% and\nmaximum error by 32.55%. These findings show that precise delay measurement and\ncompensation not only enhance underwater navigation accuracy but also establish\na generalizable framework for acoustic positioning integration, offering\nvaluable insights into time alignment and data fusion in latency-sensitive\nmulti-sensor systems.",

    "title": "Reliable Robotic Task Execution in the Face of Anomalies",
    "summary": "Learned robot policies have consistently been shown to be versatile, but they\ntypically have no built-in mechanism for handling the complexity of open\nenvironments, making them prone to execution failures; this implies that\ndeploying policies without the ability to recognise and react to failures may\nlead to unreliable and unsafe robot behaviour. In this paper, we present a\nframework that couples a learned policy with a method to detect visual\nanomalies during policy deployment and to perform recovery behaviours when\nnecessary, thereby aiming to prevent failures. Specifically, we train an\nanomaly detection model using data collected during nominal executions of a\ntrained policy. This model is then integrated into the online policy execution\nprocess, so that deviations from the nominal execution can trigger a\nthree-level sequential recovery process that consists of (i) pausing the\nexecution temporarily, (ii) performing a local perturbation of the robot's\nstate, and (iii) resetting the robot to a safe state by sampling from a learned\nexecution success model. We verify our proposed method in two different\nscenarios: (i) a door handle reaching task with a Kinova Gen3 arm using a\npolicy trained in simulation and transferred to the real robot, and (ii) an\nobject placing task with a UFactory xArm 6 using a general-purpose policy\nmodel. Our results show that integrating policy execution with anomaly\ndetection and recovery increases the execution success rate in environments\nwith various anomalies, such as trajectory deviations and adversarial human\ninterventions.",

    "summary": "Enabling robots to dexterously grasp and manipulate objects based on human\ncommands is a promising direction in robotics. However, existing approaches are\nchallenging to generalize across diverse objects or tasks due to the limited\nscale of semantic dexterous grasp datasets. Foundation models offer a new way\nto enhance generalization, yet directly leveraging them to generate feasible\nrobotic actions remains challenging due to the gap between abstract model\nknowledge and physical robot execution. To address these challenges, we propose\nOmniDexGrasp, a generalizable framework that achieves omni-capabilities in user\nprompting, dexterous embodiment, and grasping tasks by combining foundation\nmodels with the transfer and control strategies. OmniDexGrasp integrates three\nkey modules: (i) foundation models are used to enhance generalization by\ngenerating human grasp images supporting omni-capability of user prompt and\ntask; (ii) a human-image-to-robot-action transfer strategy converts human\ndemonstrations into executable robot actions, enabling omni dexterous\nembodiment; (iii) force-aware adaptive grasp strategy ensures robust and stable\ngrasp execution. Experiments in simulation and on real robots validate the\neffectiveness of OmniDexGrasp on diverse user prompts, grasp task and dexterous\nhands, and further results show its extensibility to dexterous manipulation\ntasks.",

It is crucial to control the\nsubstrate and the oncoming tape onto a specific temperature level to ensure an\noptimal consolidation between the different layers of the product.

In contrast to many other\nsystems, with this approach, the tape laying device is spatially fixed and the\nshape is moved accordingly by the robot, which allows for handling of rather\ncompact and complex shapes.

    "summary": "Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic\ncontrol into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve\nstrong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale\ncrowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures\nduring execution. Enabling robots to reason and recover from unpredictable and\nabrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing robotic manipulation\ndatasets, collected in either simulation or the real world, primarily provide\nonly ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable to recover once failures\noccur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure detection typically\noffer only textual explanations, which are difficult to utilize directly in VLA\nmodels. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a novel failure generation\nand recovery system that automatically produces diverse failure cases paired\nwith executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be seamlessly applied to any\nmanipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable creation of failure\naction data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune LLaVa-OneVision-7B\n(LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results show that\nFailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arms detect and recover from potential\nfailures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA models\n(pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several tasks\nin Maniskill.

The core of PISAC lies\nin deriving a closed-form safety bound that explicitly links ISAC transmit\npower to sensing uncertainty, based on the Cram\\'er-Rao Bound and occupancy\ninflation principles. Using this model, we formulate a bilevel power allocation\nand motion planning (PAMP) problem, where the inner layer optimizes the ISAC\nbeam power distribution and the outer layer computes a collision-free\ntrajectory under uncertainty-aware safety constraints. Comprehensive\nsimulations in high-fidelity urban driving environments demonstrate that PISAC\nachieves up to 40% higher success rates and over 5% shorter traversal times\nthan existing ISAC-based and communication-oriented benchmarks, validating its\neffectiveness in enhancing both safety and efficiency.",

We evaluate ManiDP on six real-world\nbimanual tasks, where the experimental results demonstrate a 39.33$\\%$ increase\nin average manipulation success rate and a 0.45 improvement in task\ncompatibility compared to baseline methods.

To mitigate this, we introduce the\nSpatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that\nenriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight\nlatency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D\nobject representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian\nassignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal\nscene graph.

    "title": "Never Too Rigid to Reach: Adaptive Virtual Model Control with LLM- and\n  Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning",
    "summary": "Robotic arms are increasingly deployed in uncertain environments, yet\nconventional control pipelines often become rigid and brittle when exposed to\nperturbations or incomplete information. Virtual Model Control (VMC) enables\ncompliant behaviors by embedding virtual forces and mapping them into joint\ntorques, but its reliance on fixed parameters and limited coordination among\nvirtual components constrains adaptability and may undermine stability as task\nobjectives evolve. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive VMC with\nLarge Language Model (LLM)- and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL),\nwhich preserves the physical interpretability of VMC while supporting\nstability-guaranteed online adaptation. The LLM provides structured priors and\nhigh-level reasoning that enhance coordination among virtual components,\nimprove sample efficiency, and facilitate flexible adjustment to varying task\nrequirements. Complementarily, Lyapunov-based RL enforces theoretical stability\nconstraints, ensuring safe and reliable adaptation under uncertainty. Extensive\nsimulations on a 7-DoF Panda arm demonstrate that our approach effectively\nbalances competing objectives in dynamic tasks, achieving superior performance\nwhile highlighting the synergistic benefits of LLM guidance and\nLyapunov-constrained adaptation.",

    "title": "Drone Carry-on Weight and Wind Flow Assessment via Micro-Doppler\n  Analysis",
    "summary": "Remote monitoring of drones has become a global objective due to emerging\napplications in national security and managing aerial delivery traffic. Despite\ntheir relatively small size, drones can carry significant payloads, which\nrequire monitoring, especially in cases of unauthorized transportation of\ndangerous goods. A drone's flight dynamics heavily depend on outdoor wind\nconditions and the carry-on weight, which affect the tilt angle of a drone's\nbody and the rotation velocity of the blades. A surveillance radar can capture\nboth effects, provided a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for the received\nechoes and an adjusted postprocessing detection algorithm. Here, we conduct a\nsystematic study to demonstrate that micro-Doppler analysis enables the\ndisentanglement of the impacts of wind and weight on a hovering drone. The\nphysics behind the effect is related to the flight controller, as the way the\ndrone counteracts weight and wind differs. When the payload is balanced, it\nimposes an additional load symmetrically on all four rotors, causing them to\nrotate faster, thereby generating a blade-related micro-Doppler shift at a\nhigher frequency. However, the impact of the wind is different. The wind\nattempts to displace the drone, and to counteract this, the drone tilts to the\nside. As a result, the forward and rear rotors rotate at different velocities\nto maintain the tilt angle of the drone body relative to the airflow direction.\nThis causes the splitting in the micro-Doppler spectra. By performing a set of\nexperiments in a controlled environment, specifically, an anechoic chamber for\nelectromagnetic isolation and a wind tunnel for imposing deterministic wind\nconditions, we demonstrate that both wind and payload details can be extracted\nusing a simple deterministic algorithm based on branching in the micro-Doppler\nspectra.",

    "title": "Kinematically Controllable Cable Robots with Reconfigurable\n  End-effectors",
    "summary": "To enlarge the translational workspace of cable-driven robots, one common\napproach is to increase the number of cables. However, this introduces two\nchallenges: (1) cable interference significantly reduces the rotational\nworkspace, and (2) the solution of tensions in cables becomes non-unique,\nresulting in difficulties for kinematic control of the robot. In this work, we\ndesign structurally simple reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots. By\nincorporating a spring, a helical-grooved shaft, and a matching nut, relative\nlinear motions between end-effector components are converted into relative\nrotations, thereby expanding the rotational workspace of the mechanism.\nMeanwhile, a bearing is introduced to provide an additional rotational degree\nof freedom, making the mechanism non-redundant. As a result, the robot's motion\ncan be controlled purely through kinematics without additional tension sensing\nand control.",

    "title": "Analytical Swarm Chemistry: Characterization and Analysis of Emergent\n  Swarm Behaviors",
    "summary": "Swarm robotics has potential for a wide variety of applications, but\nreal-world deployments remain rare due to the difficulty of predicting emergent\nbehaviors arising from simple local interactions. Traditional engineering\napproaches design controllers to achieve desired macroscopic outcomes under\nidealized conditions, while agent-based and artificial life studies explore\nemergent phenomena in a bottom-up, exploratory manner. In this work, we\nintroduce Analytical Swarm Chemistry, a framework that integrates concepts from\nengineering, agent-based and artificial life research, and chemistry. This\nframework combines macrostate definitions with phase diagram analysis to\nsystematically explore how swarm parameters influence emergent behavior.\nInspired by concepts from chemistry, the framework treats parameters like\nthermodynamic variables, enabling visualization of regions in parameter space\nthat give rise to specific behaviors. Applying this framework to agents with\nminimally viable capabilities, we identify sufficient conditions for behaviors\nsuch as milling and diffusion and uncover regions of the parameter space that\nreliably produce these behaviors. Preliminary validation on real robots\ndemonstrates that these regions correspond to observable behaviors in practice.\nBy providing a principled, interpretable approach, this framework lays the\ngroundwork for predictable and reliable emergent behavior in real-world swarm\nsystems.",

    "title": "Learning Neural Observer-Predictor Models for Limb-level Sampling-based\n  Locomotion Planning",
    "summary": "Accurate full-body motion prediction is essential for the safe, autonomous\nnavigation of legged robots, enabling critical capabilities like limb-level\ncollision checking in cluttered environments. Simplified kinematic models often\nfail to capture the complex, closed-loop dynamics of the robot and its\nlow-level controller, limiting their predictions to simple planar motion. To\naddress this, we present a learning-based observer-predictor framework that\naccurately predicts this motion. Our method features a neural observer with\nprovable UUB guarantees that provides a reliable latent state estimate from a\nhistory of proprioceptive measurements. This stable estimate initializes a\ncomputationally efficient predictor, designed for the rapid, parallel\nevaluation of thousands of potential trajectories required by modern\nsampling-based planners. We validated the system by integrating our neural\npredictor into an MPPI-based planner on a Vision 60 quadruped. Hardware\nexperiments successfully demonstrated effective, limb-aware motion planning in\na challenging, narrow passage and over small objects, highlighting our system's\nability to provide a robust foundation for high-performance, collision-aware\nplanning on dynamic robotic platforms.",

    "title": "PIP-LLM: Integrating PDDL-Integer Programming with LLMs for Coordinating\n  Multi-Robot Teams Using Natural Language",
    "summary": "Enabling robot teams to execute natural language commands requires\ntranslating high-level instructions into feasible, efficient multi-robot plans.\nWhile Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Planning Domain Description\nLanguage (PDDL) offer promise for single-robot scenarios, existing approaches\nstruggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor\nscalability, and low coordination efficiency.\n  We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists\nof PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based\nrobot-level planning. PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the\ncommand into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level\nplan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a\nsubtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a\ndependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a\ndependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each\nsubtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem,\nexplicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot\ncapabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from\nassignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition\nand scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM\nimproves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and\nachieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",
