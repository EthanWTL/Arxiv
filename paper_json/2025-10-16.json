    "title": "Coupled Diffusion Sampling for Training-Free Multi-View Image Editing",
    "summary": "We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view\nconsistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These\nmodels can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of\nmulti-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency\nacross views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over\nexplicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization\nprocess and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D\nregularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to\nadhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through\ncoupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that\nconcurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution\nand a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the\nmulti-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the\neffectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view\nimage editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model\narchitectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for\nmulti-view consistent editing.",

    "summary": "The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising\ncontender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and\ntraining paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread\nexploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs\napart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)\nHow to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby\naccelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges\nand outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one\nnative VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word\nrepresentations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the\nstrengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently\nembody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language\nencoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of\nnative VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular\ncounterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text\nexamples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while\nmitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model\ncrafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for\nscalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable\ncomponents that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem.

We\napproach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task\nin which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional\ndemands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To\nsupport this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the\nmachine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical\nsimulation and reward-driven evaluation.

    "summary": "World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of\nthe real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned\nrepresentations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D\nnature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and\ndiminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present\nTerra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable\nenvironments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel\npoint-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into\na latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian\nprimitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse\npoint flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point\nrepresentation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the\npoint latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D\nrepresentation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any\nviewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves\nexplorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent\nspace. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from\nScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction\nand generation with high 3D consistency.",

    "summary": "Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image\nresearch, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images\naligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired\ndatasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most\napproaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to\na failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the\nreference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in\npose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability\nand limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we\n(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for\nmulti-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)\nintroduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the\ntrade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel\ntraining paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data\nto balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in\nWithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while\npreserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste\nartifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains\nstrong perceptual quality.

    "summary": "This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for\ndiffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while\nminimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all\ntokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little\nacross most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial\nredundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\\bf MASK}$ tokens\nprimarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active\nprediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that\nselective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the\nmost-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative\nlower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose\n${\\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that\njointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the\nmost-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that\nrecomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and\noff-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs\nadaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant\ncomputation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation\nquality.

However, existing\napproaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at\nthe final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in\nmulti-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:\n(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and\nprovide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit\nassignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in\nlong-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy\nOptimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense\nand intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each\ninteraction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the\nground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the\npolicy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior\nprocess-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly\nMonte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the\nmodel's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined\nwith outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories.

    "summary": "Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry\nand camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent\npointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great\nprogress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic\nscenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving\nobjects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the\nreconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages\ntemporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to\n4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of\ncorrespondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train\na dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,\nfacilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from\nthe static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.\nFurthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to\nrecover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the\ncorrespondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling\nfully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework\nachieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across\nmultiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,\nand point tracking.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often\nprioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead\nto catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions\n(CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally\ndeployed \\emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior,\nthe fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to\nconservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating\nsafe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \\emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key\nattributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety\nconstraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in\ntraining. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be\ndeployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically,\nwe demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned\npolicy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards --\nenabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We\nvalidate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster\nconvergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid\nrobot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without\na runtime safety filter.",

    "summary": "Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in\nsynthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical\nchallenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and\ncontextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world\nmotions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we\nintroduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as\npositive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion\nsynthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers\nlimited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting\nreal-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative\nself-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support\npost-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated\ndataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and\nprecise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO\nsignificantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism\ncompared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization\ntechniques.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior\nstudies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into\nthe standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification\ncapabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM\nto sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate\nprompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we\ntheoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of\nself-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true\nreasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,\nwhich is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token\nlog-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last\ntoken and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on\nthis insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token\nSelf-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with\na MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based\nreasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding\ncapabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in\nboth training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm\nderives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of\nthe last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra\ncost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not\nonly improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with\nremarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time\nscaling performance.",

    "summary": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying\nerrors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of\nscalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human\nlabeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte\nCarlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes\nand often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit\nmisattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,\nlow factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and\nfidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward\nnoise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured\nreasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated\nsupervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,\nproviding execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level\nvalidation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation\nmechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.\nFinally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative\nstructure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned\nLLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,\namounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with\nauto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative\nimprovement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided\ngreedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled\nsupervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality\nprocess-level reasoning.",

    "summary": "Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference\npipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines\nan implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.\nHowever, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,\ncompared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head\nover the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a\ngeneralization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They\ncan be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and\ndiffer only in how the reward is computed. Toward a fundamental understanding\nof the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate\nthe root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,\nis that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,\nthey often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,\nas well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against\nalternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge\nthe intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder\nthan verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.\nTaken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can\nsubstantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.",

    "summary": "Performance bugs are inefficiencies in software that waste computational\nresources without causing functional failures, making them particularly\nchallenging to detect and fix. While recent advances in Software Engineering\nagents have shown promise in automated bug fixing, existing benchmarks\nprimarily focus on functional correctness and fail to evaluate agents'\nabilities to identify and resolve non-functional issues like performance bugs.\nWe introduce PerfBench, a benchmark comprising 81 real-world performance\nbug-fixing tasks from popular .NET repositories on GitHub. Unlike existing\nbenchmarks that rely on pre-existing test suites, PerfBench features a novel\nevaluation harness that allows agents to generate their own performance\nbenchmarks and validates fixes by comparing execution metrics collected for\ndeveloper fix and agent fix. Each task in PerfBench is derived from actual\ndeveloper fixes linked to performance-related issues, which are then verified\nby human experts, ensuring real-world relevance. Our evaluation reveals that\ncurrent state-of-the-art coding agents struggle with performance optimization\ntasks, with baseline OpenHands agent achieving only a ~3% success rate on our\nbenchmark. We develop OpenHands-Perf-Agent, which incorporates\nperformance-aware tooling and instructions and achieves a ~20% success rate on\nthe benchmark. We show that by ensuring the agent has proper instructions to\nbenchmark its changes and tooling for benchmark output processing, we can\nimprove the agent performance significantly, but room for improvement still\nremains. PerfBench provides a challenging test set for furthering the\ncapabilities of agents in fixing performance issues.",

    "summary": "Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of\nlarge language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art\napproaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a\npool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,\nlimiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more\nbudget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough\nempirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may\nunderperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid\napproach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,\nunder a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art\ngenerative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\\% higher\naccuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world\napplications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a\n\"free\" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient\nalternative to costly generative techniques.

However, despite the widespread success of\nthis paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly\nnovel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.\nIn our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking\nwhether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at\ninference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened\ndistributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the\nbase models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our\nalgorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even\noutperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including\nMATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in\ndiversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.\nCrucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a\nverifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.",

    "summary": "In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable\ndamage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that\nall errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit\nalgorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this\nassumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help\nfrom a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we\nformalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a\ntwo-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent\nobserves an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit\n(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are\nupper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed\nLipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when\nnot to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available\nevidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.\ninputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely\nin high-stakes environments.",

These limitations lead to unreliable\noutput, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly\nwhen interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such\nas codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the\nGatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs\nagent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate\nand reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity \"latent state\" representation of the\nsystem to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All\ninteractions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a\ndeclarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the\nsystem remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the\nGatekeeper Protocol for software development.

The key new idea is an\nanalytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with\nrespect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble\nHermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite\neigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find\nthat real image data is often \"Gaussian enough\" for the HEA to hold well in\npractice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results\nrelating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel\nregression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn\nHermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA.

We propose a novel non-parametric approach that\ncomputes tight bounds on counterfactual transition probabilities across all\ncompatible causal models. Unlike previous methods that require solving\nprohibitively large optimisation problems (with variables that grow\nexponentially in the size of the MDP), our approach provides closed-form\nexpressions for these bounds, making computation highly efficient and scalable\nfor non-trivial MDPs.

    "summary": "The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work\nshowed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive\nequivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such\nredundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the\nRashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs,\ni.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work,\nMcTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related\nwith DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. The approach of\nMcTavish et al. consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey\n(QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations\nof DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence.\nFurthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing\nexplanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the\npresence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard\nfor the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit\nworst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates\nthat there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running\ntime and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that the QM method may\nincorrectly decide predictive equivalence, if two key constraints are not\nrespected, and one may be difficult to formally guarantee. Third, the paper\nshows that any of the problems to which the smallest DNF representation has\nbeen applied to can be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The\nexperiments confirm that, for DTs for which the worst-case of the QM method is\ntriggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster\nthan the ones proposed by McTavish et al.",

    "summary": "Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to\nquestion-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long\ncontext length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the\nself-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior\nis often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses\nand highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the\nDual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA\ntask that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within\na strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial\nresponse; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more\ndeliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the\nprevious stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy\nfrom 25.6% to 27.3% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 51.0% for\nDeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone\nachieves 25.2% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial\ninference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and\ndeliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from\ntargeted training. Additionally, we have open-sourced both the trained models\nand the source code.",

    "summary": "The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language\nmodels (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program\ndiscovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where\nto search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally\nstructured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal\ntheory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by\ndomain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and\noutputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a\nfixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all\nreachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a\ncoverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability\ndifficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph\ninduced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable\ninferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory\noffers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their\nsearch spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search\nconstructed by LLMs.",

We introduce Instruction\nBoosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt\ninstructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction\nfollowing rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for\nten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a\nbenchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data\nsample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that\nperformance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important\nfactor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that\narises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative\nconflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and\nprovides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt\ninstructions have on a model's performance.",

    "summary": "When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners\ntypically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already\nbeen solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the\nparameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a\nspecific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different\npre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we\nshow that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the\ngradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel\nmethod that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to\ntransfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this\nrequires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a\nfew gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector\naccordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss\nlandscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We\nprovide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and\nlanguage benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and\nfew-shot fine-tuning.",

While current prompt-tuning methods often introduce learnable\nprompts, they predominantly treat prompts as isolated, independent components\nacross different network layers. This overlooks the complex and synergistic\nhigher-order interactions that exist between prompts at various hierarchical\ndepths, consequently limiting the expressive power and semantic richness of the\nprompted model. To address this fundamental gap, we propose a novel framework\nthat explicitly models the Higher-order Interactions of Multi-layer Prompt. Our\napproach conceptualizes prompts from different layers not as separate entities,\nbut as a cohesive system where their inter-relationships are critical. We\ndesign an innovative interaction module that captures these sophisticated,\nnon-linear correlations among multi-layer prompts, effectively modeling their\ncooperative effects. This allows the model to dynamically aggregate and refine\nprompt information across the network's depth, leading to a more integrated and\npowerful prompting strategy. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our method, by leveraging these higher-order interactions,\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art prompt-tuning baselines. The\nperformance advantage is particularly pronounced in few-shot scenarios,\nvalidating that capturing the intricate interplay between multi-layer prompts\nis key to unlocking more robust and generalizable representation learning.",

Each year, more than 300 million computed\ntomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for\neffective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on\nthese CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence\n(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such\nmodels typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines\nof tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,\nrequiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT\nscan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing\nthe tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology\nresults--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI\ntraining. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match\ntheir descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with\nlarge collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing\nthe need for manually drawn tumor masks.

    "title": "LLM-guided Chemical Process Optimization with a Multi-Agent Approach",
    "summary": "Chemical process optimization maximizes production efficiency and economic\nperformance, but optimization algorithms, including gradient-based solvers,\nnumerical methods, and parameter grid searches, become impractical when\noperating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable. We present a multi-agent\nLLM framework that autonomously infers operating constraints from minimal\nprocess descriptions, then collaboratively guides optimization. Our\nAutoGen-based framework employs OpenAI's o3 model with specialized agents for\nconstraint generation, parameter validation, simulation, and optimization\nguidance. Through autonomous constraint generation and iterative multi-agent\noptimization, the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational\nbounds. Validated on hydrodealkylation across cost, yield, and yield-to-cost\nratio metrics, the framework achieved competitive performance with conventional\nmethods while reducing wall-time 31-fold relative to grid search, converging in\nunder 20 minutes. The reasoning-guided search demonstrates sophisticated\nprocess understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs and applying\ndomain-informed heuristics. Unlike conventional methods requiring predefined\nconstraints, our approach uniquely combines autonomous constraint generation\nwith interpretable parameter exploration. Model comparison reveals\nreasoning-capable architectures (o3, o1) are essential for successful\noptimization, while standard models fail to converge. This approach is\nparticularly valuable for emerging processes and retrofit applications where\noperational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable.",

    "summary": "In the last few years, due to the broad applicability of deep learning to\ndownstream tasks and end-to-end training capabilities, increasingly more\nconcerns about potential biases to specific, non-representative patterns have\nbeen raised. Many works focusing on unsupervised debiasing usually leverage the\ntendency of deep models to learn ``easier'' samples, for example by clustering\nthe latent space to obtain bias pseudo-labels. However, the interpretation of\nsuch pseudo-labels is not trivial, especially for a non-expert end user, as it\ndoes not provide semantic information about the bias features. To address this\nissue, we introduce ``Say My Name'' (SaMyNa), the first tool to identify biases\nwithin deep models semantically. Unlike existing methods, our approach focuses\non biases learned by the model. Our text-based pipeline enhances explainability\nand supports debiasing efforts: applicable during either training or post-hoc\nvalidation, our method can disentangle task-related information and proposes\nitself as a tool to analyze biases. Evaluation on traditional benchmarks\ndemonstrates its effectiveness in detecting biases and even disclaiming them,\nshowcasing its broad applicability for model diagnosis.",

    "summary": "User interests on content platforms are inherently diverse, manifesting\nthrough complex behavioral patterns across heterogeneous scenarios such as\nsearch, feed browsing, and content discovery. Traditional recommendation\nsystems typically prioritize business metric optimization within isolated\nspecific scenarios, neglecting cross-scenario behavioral signals and struggling\nto integrate advanced techniques like LLMs at billion-scale deployments, which\nfinally limits their ability to capture holistic user interests across platform\ntouchpoints. We propose RED-Rec, an LLM-enhanced hierarchical Recommender\nEngine for Diversified scenarios, tailored for industry-level content\nrecommendation systems. RED-Rec unifies user interest representations across\nmultiple behavioral contexts by aggregating and synthesizing actions from\nvaried scenarios, resulting in comprehensive item and user modeling. At its\ncore, a two-tower LLM-powered framework enables nuanced, multifaceted\nrepresentations with deployment efficiency, and a scenario-aware dense mixing\nand querying policy effectively fuses diverse behavioral signals to capture\ncross-scenario user intent patterns and express fine-grained, context-specific\nintents during serving. We validate RED-Rec through online A/B testing on\nhundreds of millions of users in RedNote through online A/B testing, showing\nsubstantial performance gains in both content recommendation and advertisement\ntargeting tasks. We further introduce a million-scale sequential recommendation\ndataset, RED-MMU, for comprehensive offline training and evaluation.

    "summary": "MOVEMETHOD is a hallmark refactoring. Despite a plethora of research tools\nthat recommend which methods to move and where, these recommendations do not\nalign with how expert developers perform MOVEMETHOD. Given the extensive\ntraining of Large Language Models and their reliance upon naturalness of code,\nthey should expertly recommend which methods are misplaced in a given class and\nwhich classes are better hosts. Our formative study of 2016 LLM recommendations\nrevealed that LLMs give expert suggestions, yet they are unreliable: up to 80%\nof the suggestions are hallucinations. We introduce the first LLM fully powered\nassistant for MOVEMETHOD refactoring that automates its whole end-to-end\nlifecycle, from recommendation to execution. We designed novel solutions that\nautomatically filter LLM hallucinations using static analysis from IDEs and a\nnovel workflow that requires LLMs to be self-consistent, critique, and rank\nrefactoring suggestions. As MOVEMETHOD refactoring requires global,\nprojectlevel reasoning, we solved the limited context size of LLMs by employing\nrefactoring-aware retrieval augment generation (RAG). Our approach, MM-assist,\nsynergistically combines the strengths of the LLM, IDE, static analysis, and\nsemantic relevance. In our thorough, multi-methodology empirical evaluation, we\ncompare MM-assist with the previous state-of-the-art approaches. MM-assist\nsignificantly outperforms them: (i) on a benchmark widely used by other\nresearchers, our Recall@1 and Recall@3 show a 1.7x improvement; (ii) on a\ncorpus of 210 recent refactorings from Open-source software, our Recall rates\nimprove by at least 2.4x. Lastly, we conducted a user study with 30 experienced\nparticipants who used MM-assist to refactor their own code for one week. They\nrated 82.8% of MM-assist recommendations positively. This shows that MM-assist\nis both effective and useful.",

    "summary": "Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,\nsuch as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut\ntraining. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having\naccurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps\nderived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition\nand transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond\nEarth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface\nreconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep\nlearning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's\ncomprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches\ncannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation\ntechniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this\nwork, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an\nunconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset\nof 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A\nnon-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple\nscales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our\nmethod against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including\nInverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an\nevaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently\noutperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)\nand perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.",

    "summary": "Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,\nparticularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks\nprocess-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative\nwriting dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought\nprocesses through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike\nexisting datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises\n1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a\nreverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting\ndecision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive\nexperiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative\nlogic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained\nby general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)\nProcess supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general\ndata. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is\nneeded to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate\nprogressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities\nare culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between\nChinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely\ncorrelates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity\nsignals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings\nestablish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical\nscaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning\nenhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.",

    "summary": "The growing integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into critical\nsocietal domains has raised concerns about embedded biases that can perpetuate\nstereotypes and undermine fairness. Such biases may stem from historical\ninequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, or adversarial\nmanipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies show that LLMs remain\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit biased outputs. This work\nproposes a scalable benchmarking framework to assess LLM robustness to\nadversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves: (i) systematically\nprobing models across multiple tasks targeting diverse sociocultural biases,\n(ii) quantifying robustness through safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge\napproach, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to reveal safety\nvulnerabilities. To facilitate systematic benchmarking, we release a curated\ndataset of bias-related prompts, named CLEAR-Bias. Our analysis, identifying\nDeepSeek V3 as the most reliable judge LLM, reveals that bias resilience is\nuneven, with age, disability, and intersectional biases among the most\nprominent. Some small models outperform larger ones in safety, suggesting that\ntraining and architecture may matter more than scale. However, no model is\nfully robust to adversarial elicitation, with jailbreak attacks using\nlow-resource languages or refusal suppression proving effective across model\nfamilies. We also find that successive LLM generations exhibit slight safety\ngains, while models fine-tuned for the medical domain tend to be less safe than\ntheir general-purpose counterparts.",

    "title": "ConDiSim: Conditional Diffusion Models for Simulation Based Inference",
    "summary": "We present a conditional diffusion model - ConDiSim, for simulation-based\ninference of complex systems with intractable likelihoods. ConDiSim leverages\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic models to approximate posterior\ndistributions, consisting of a forward process that adds Gaussian noise to\nparameters, and a reverse process learning to denoise, conditioned on observed\ndata. This approach effectively captures complex dependencies and\nmulti-modalities within posteriors. ConDiSim is evaluated across ten benchmark\nproblems and two real-world test problems, where it demonstrates effective\nposterior approximation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and\nstability in model training. ConDiSim offers a robust and extensible framework\nfor simulation-based inference, particularly suitable for parameter inference\nworkflows requiring fast inference methods.",

    "summary": "Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models\n(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative\nwriting, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.\nMulti-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting\nseveral future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies\nand offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),\nwhich trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the\nlong-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We\nexplore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words\nsummary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use\nembeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.\nLarge-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate\nthat FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,\nand coding benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Model diffing is the study of how fine-tuning changes a model's\nrepresentations and internal algorithms. Many behaviors of interest are\nintroduced during fine-tuning, and model diffing offers a promising lens to\ninterpret such behaviors. Crosscoders are a recent model diffing method that\nlearns a shared dictionary of interpretable concepts represented as latent\ndirections in both the base and fine-tuned models, allowing us to track how\nconcepts shift or emerge during fine-tuning. Notably, prior work has observed\nconcepts with no direction in the base model, and it was hypothesized that\nthese model-specific latents were concepts introduced during fine-tuning.\nHowever, we identify two issues which stem from the crosscoders L1 training\nloss that can misattribute concepts as unique to the fine-tuned model, when\nthey really exist in both models. We develop Latent Scaling to flag these\nissues by more accurately measuring each latent's presence across models. In\nexperiments comparing Gemma 2 2B base and chat models, we observe that the\nstandard crosscoder suffers heavily from these issues. Building on these\ninsights, we train a crosscoder with BatchTopK loss and show that it\nsubstantially mitigates these issues, finding more genuinely chat-specific and\nhighly interpretable concepts. We recommend practitioners adopt similar\ntechniques. Using the BatchTopK crosscoder, we successfully identify a set of\nchat-specific latents that are both interpretable and causally effective,\nrepresenting concepts such as $\\textit{false information}$ and\n$\\textit{personal question}$, along with multiple refusal-related latents that\nshow nuanced preferences for different refusal triggers. Overall, our work\nadvances best practices for the crosscoder-based methodology for model diffing\nand demonstrates that it can provide concrete insights into how chat-tuning\nmodifies model behavior.",

While for\nSGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,\nthe optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a\nresult, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned\nheuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size\nscheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the\nlearning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the\nbatch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.\nTheoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of\nequivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy\nlinear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a\ntractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in\npractice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla\nscale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at\nequal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\\approx 36\\%$, approaching the\ntheoretical limit implied by our analysis.",

    "summary": "Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora\nhave shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks\nwith minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which\nhas long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask:\ngiven the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge\navailable as a rich \"corpus\", can a similar generative pre-training approach be\neffectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify\nan effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot\nmanipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through\nobserving dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning\nshould emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level\nactions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions\nto actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video\ncontent into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer,\nlearning a bridging \"language\" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner.\nWe pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to\ncapture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT\ndemonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion\ntokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory\nrationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to\nreal robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly\nbridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive\nexperiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and\nefficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in\ntransferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.",

However, these\nLLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the\nnative understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential\nmobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in\nindustrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and\nalignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,\nand users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance\nthe user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address\nthese issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a\nframework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the\nincorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,\nprofiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of\n2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued\npretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the\ndesensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with\nhuman preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in\ncontinual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned\ntasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although\npioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task\ninterference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the\nvarying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive\ntuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple\noptimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential\nmisalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel\nparameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies\ndynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in an end-to-end\ntraining stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck\ndimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient\nparameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment.To\neffectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the\ndynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically\nbetween the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically\nallocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on\ncontinual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency. OA-Adapter\nachieves higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the\nstandard CL benchmark, and maintains its advantages on two larger benchmarks\ncomprising 15 tasks.",

    "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving\nmachine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively\ntrain a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,\nclients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold\nnon-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses\nsignificant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)\nhas emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based\non their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL\napproaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity\narising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment\n(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across\nclients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates\ninconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also\npreserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization\nrobustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance\nwhile retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based\nweighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image\nclassification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate\nthat FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior\nperformance in personalized adaptation.",

    "summary": "Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually\nfine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model\nmerging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can\nencapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model\noften suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused\nby task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming\nredundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves\nrandomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this\nstudy, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.\nConcretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into\ntheir corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before\nlinear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,\nwhich accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.\nAs a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and\nredundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task\nvector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts\nacross models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by\noptimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification\nby our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task\nvector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,\ntasks, and model architectures.",

This paper\ncloses that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm\nconfiguration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic\nconfiguration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a\nseries of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without\ndegrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit\nexperimentally.

Given their growing societal\ninfluence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political\ndomain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic\nprocesses. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation\nacross eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test\n(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings\nof these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to\nexplore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,\nimplicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual\nversions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political\nalignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and\nextent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes\nelicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified\nvia explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and\nexplicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of\ntransparency or \"awareness\" regarding their inherent biases. This study\nunderscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models have excelled in various domains but face efficiency\nchallenges due to the growing Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence\ninference. Recent efforts aim to reduce KV cache size by evicting vast\nnon-critical cache elements during runtime while preserving generation quality.\nHowever, these methods typically allocate compression budgets uniformly across\nall attention heads, ignoring the unique attention patterns of each head. In\nthis paper, we establish a theoretical loss upper bound between pre- and\npost-eviction attention output, explaining the optimization target of prior\ncache eviction methods, while guiding the optimization of adaptive budget\nallocation. Base on this, we propose {\\it Ada-KV}, the first head-wise adaptive\nbudget allocation strategy. It offers plug-and-play benefits, enabling seamless\nintegration with prior cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on 13\ndatasets from Ruler and 16 datasets from LongBench, all conducted under both\nquestion-aware and question-agnostic scenarios, demonstrate substantial quality\nimprovements over existing methods.

    "title": "Beyond Hallucinations: The Illusion of Understanding in Large Language\n  Models",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human\ncommunication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and\nlack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs\nare fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through\nstatistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of\nhallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.\nBuilding on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition\nrather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1\ncognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection\nor falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each\ndimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies\nmisalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.\nInstead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations\nand the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically\naware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,\nwhether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by\nembedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with\nhuman understanding.",

    "summary": "Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval\ncapabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.\nRecently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable\ntechnique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing\nreward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based\nrewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in\nexpression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,\ngenerative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable\nrewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also\nincurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and\nverifiable paradigm, \"nugget-as-rubric\", which treats atomic information points\nas structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.\nShort-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand\nto multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support\nlong-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based\non query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each\nquestion and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from\ndynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \\textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a\n4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable\nparadigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage\nstrategy.

The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs\nmay look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking.

Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using\nAI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level\nasymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns\nout to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a\ncombination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to\nsuggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a\nverification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question\nposed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help\nprove intricate asymptotic inequalities.

The transition from spam-based Priority Gas Auctions\nto structured auction mechanisms like Polygon Atlas has transformed MEV\nextraction from public bidding wars into sealed-bid competitions under extreme\ntime constraints. While this shift reduces network congestion, it introduces\ncomplex strategic challenges where searchers must make optimal bidding\ndecisions within a sub-second window without knowledge of competitor behavior\nor presence.

It leverages auxiliary information through source domain tasks or\nfeatures to enhance target domain recommendations. However, incorporating\ninconsistent source domain tasks may result in insufficient cross-domain\nmodeling or negative transfer. While incorporating source domain features\nwithout considering the underlying causal relationships may limit their\ncontribution to final predictions. Thus, a natural idea is to directly train a\ncross-domain representation on a causality-labeled dataset from the source to\ntarget domain. Yet this direction has been rarely explored, as identifying\nunbiased real causal labels is highly challenging in real-world scenarios. In\nthis work, we attempt to take a first step in this direction by proposing a\ncausality-enhanced framework, named CE-CDR. Specifically, we first reformulate\nthe cross-domain recommendation as a causal graph for principled guidance. We\nthen construct a causality-aware dataset heuristically. Subsequently, we derive\na theoretically unbiased Partial Label Causal Loss to generalize beyond the\nbiased causality-aware dataset to unseen cross-domain patterns, yielding an\nenriched cross-domain representation, which is then fed into the target model\nto enhance target-domain recommendations. Theoretical and empirical analyses,\nas well as extensive experiments, demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness\nof CE-CDR and its general applicability as a model-agnostic plugin.

    "summary": "The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence\n(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research\ncalls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the\nexisting explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer\ninterpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a\nmodel's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current\ncounterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including\ngradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the\nalignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation\nalgorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable\nand informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries\ndiverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to\nmodels with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop\nsystems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that\nrequire the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We\nprovide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that\nLeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations\nthat offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable\ncounterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially\nused as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly\napplicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert\ninterpretability.",

Strategies that work for some\nindividuals may be counterproductive for others. We hypothesize that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) can facilitate the design of individual-specific nudges\nwithout the need for costly and time-intensive behavioural data collection and\nmodelling. To test this, we use LLMs to design personalized decoy-based nudges\ntailored to individual profiles and cultural contexts, aimed at encouraging air\ntravellers to voluntarily offset CO$_2$ emissions from flights. We evaluate\ntheir effectiveness through a large-scale survey experiment ($n=3495$)\nconducted across five countries. Results show that LLM-informed personalized\nnudges are more effective than uniform settings, raising offsetting rates by\n3-7$\\%$ in Germany, Singapore, and the US, though not in China or India. Our\nstudy highlights the potential of LLM as a low-cost testbed for piloting nudge\nstrategies.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world\napplications ranging from chatbots to agentic systems, where they are expected\nto process untrusted data and follow trusted instructions. Failure to\ndistinguish between the two poses significant security risks, exploited by\nprompt injection attacks, which inject malicious instructions into the data to\ncontrol model outputs. Model-level defenses have been proposed to mitigate\nprompt injection attacks. These defenses fine-tune LLMs to ignore injected\ninstructions in untrusted data. We introduce Checkpoint-GCG, a white-box attack\nagainst fine-tuning-based defenses. Checkpoint-GCG enhances the Greedy\nCoordinate Gradient (GCG) attack by leveraging intermediate model checkpoints\nproduced during fine-tuning to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting as a\nstepping stone for the next one to continuously improve attacks. First, we\ninstantiate Checkpoint-GCG to evaluate the robustness of the state-of-the-art\ndefenses in an auditing setup, assuming both (a) full knowledge of the model\ninput and (b) access to intermediate model checkpoints. We show Checkpoint-GCG\nto achieve up to $96\\%$ attack success rate (ASR) against the strongest\ndefense. Second, we relax the first assumption by searching for a universal\nsuffix that would work on unseen inputs, and obtain up to $89.9\\%$ ASR against\nthe strongest defense.

    "summary": "The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents\nto operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user\ninterfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,\nreal-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid\nsolutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline\nstatic benchmarks can only validate a single predefined \"golden path\", while\nonline dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility\nof real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively\nassessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online\nevaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel\ngraph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed\nduring real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic\nbehaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on\ncomplex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,\nsubtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.\nColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average\nlength of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and\nseveral typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating\nColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models\nand propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance\nagents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental\nresults.

Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms\nbaseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and\nrecovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results\nvalidate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces\nfrom diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,\nenhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work\nestablishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges\nretrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug\ndiscovery.",

Inducing\njust-in-time objectives (e.g., \"Clarify the abstract's research contribution\")\nenables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based\non relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or\nsurface ambiguous terminology.

    "summary": "Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining\ncoherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two\npractical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)\noften collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;\nand (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor\ntexture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video\nframework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we\nintroduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,\nuser-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by\naveraging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the\ninstance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while\nremaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token\nspace with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the\nfirst frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB\n\\(+\\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors\nstructure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving\ntemporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.",

Our results show LLMs overall struggle on\nthe target structures, but especially on garden path (GP) sentences.

For each\ntarget structure, we also collect data for their matched baseline without the\ndifficult structure. Comparing performance on the target vs. baseline\nsentences, the performance gap observed in humans holds for LLMs, with two\nexceptions: for models that are too weak performance is uniformly low across\nboth sentence types, and for models that are too strong the performance is\nuniformly high.

    "summary": "Causal discovery methods can identify valid adjustment sets for causal effect\nestimation for a pair of target variables, even when the underlying causal\ngraph is unknown. Global causal discovery methods focus on learning the whole\ncausal graph and therefore enable the recovery of optimal adjustment sets,\ni.e., sets with the lowest asymptotic variance, but they quickly become\ncomputationally prohibitive as the number of variables grows. Local causal\ndiscovery methods offer a more scalable alternative by focusing on the local\nneighborhood of the target variables, but are restricted to statistically\nsuboptimal adjustment sets. In this work, we propose Local Optimal Adjustments\nDiscovery (LOAD), a sound and complete causal discovery approach that combines\nthe computational efficiency of local methods with the statistical optimality\nof global methods. First, LOAD identifies the causal relation between the\ntargets and tests if the causal effect is identifiable by using only local\ninformation. If it is identifiable, it then finds the optimal adjustment set by\nleveraging local causal discovery to infer the mediators and their parents.\nOtherwise, it returns the locally valid parent adjustment sets based on the\nlearned local structure. In our experiments on synthetic and realistic data\nLOAD outperforms global methods in scalability, while providing more accurate\neffect estimation than local methods.",

    "summary": "Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring\nmassive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective\nalternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the\nunavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through\nselective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.\nHowever, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of\nAI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within\nthe AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{Conformal\nLabeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be\nprovably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate\n(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In\nparticular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by\ncomparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances\nmislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are\nbelow a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as\ntrustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls\nthe FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of\nAI-assigned labels is correct on average.

    "summary": "Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide\ninterpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based\nexclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also\nrestricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.\nConcept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a\nsidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant\ninformation. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises\ninterpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations\ntransmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled\ntechnique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this\ngap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model\nthat subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we\nintroduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a\nCSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and\nwithout sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which\nexplicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,\nwe analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the\nsidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs\nacross different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that\nstate-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low\nrepresentation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially\nimproves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned\ninterpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical\ntools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a\nprincipled manner.",

    "summary": "Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and\nfunction calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can\nthis software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in\nits own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward\nbroader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended\nexperimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability\nto generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with\nits environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can\nreliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information\nacross runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive\nto prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form\nself-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current\nlimits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future\ndirections for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and\npursue abstract long-term goals.",

    "title": "Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization",
    "summary": "Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant\nprogress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of\nweb agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore\nhigh-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive\nreliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the\ntraining collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by\nentropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an\nagentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy\nupdate phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic\nentropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch\nsampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty\non consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;\nand (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient\noperation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale\ngradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage\nestimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14\nchallenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL\nalgorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive\nresults: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker\nfor Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on\nWebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout\nsampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating\nscalable web agent training.",

    "summary": "Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose\npredictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural\nconstraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for\nreliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural\nand symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping\nlow-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning\ninfers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior\nknowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the\nconcepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning\nShortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the\nconcepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's\nexplanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore\nreliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless\nconcept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the\nliterature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and\npractitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview\naddresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing\ntheir causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and\nelucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,\nit details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness\nstrategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced\nmaterial in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying\nperspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we\nhope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and\ntrustworthy AI models.",

    "summary": "AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are\nconcurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond\nsimple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's\napplications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a\nshift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools\nby including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the\nprompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a\ngrowing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts\nbecome longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and\nreduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the\nprompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework\ndesigned to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large\nsets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and\nuses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,\nbased on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe\nthe design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used\nto evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt\nsize without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond\neffectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows\nsubstantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,\neffectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in\nhigh-complexity agent environments.",

Unsupervised learning is therefore a natural approach for\nexploring the design of biological neural networks and their computations.\nAccordingly, redundancy reduction has been suggested as a prominent design\nprinciple of neural encoding, but its ``mechanistic'' biological implementation\nis unclear. Analogously, unsupervised training of artificial neural networks\nyields internal representations that allow for accurate stimulus classification\nor decoding, but typically rely on biologically-implausible implementations. We\nsuggest that interactions between parallel subnetworks in the brain may\nunderlie such learning: we present a model of representation learning by\nensembles of neural networks, where each network learns to encode stimuli into\nan abstract representation space by cross-supervising interactions with other\nnetworks, for inputs they receive simultaneously or in close temporal\nproximity. Aiming for biological plausibility, each network has a small\n``receptive field'', thus receiving a fixed part of the external input, and the\nnetworks do not share weights. We find that for different types of network\narchitectures, and for both visual or neuronal stimuli, these cross-supervising\nnetworks learn semantic representations that are easily decodable and that\ndecoding accuracy is comparable to supervised networks -- both at the level of\nsingle networks and the ensemble. We further show that performance is optimal\nfor small receptive fields, and that sparse connectivity between networks is\nnearly as accurate as all-to-all interactions, with far fewer computations. We\nthus suggest a sparsely interacting collective of cross-supervising networks as\nan algorithmic framework for representational learning and collective\ncomputation in the brain.",

    "summary": "The emergence of graph foundation models (GFMs), particularly those\nincorporating language models (LMs), has revolutionized graph learning and\ndemonstrated remarkable performance on text-attributed graphs (TAGs). However,\ncompared to traditional GNNs, these LM-empowered GFMs introduce unique security\nvulnerabilities during the unsecured prompt tuning phase that remain\nunderstudied in current research. Through empirical investigation, we reveal a\nsignificant performance degradation in traditional graph backdoor attacks when\noperating in attribute-inaccessible constrained TAG systems without explicit\ntrigger node attribute optimization. To address this, we propose a novel\ndual-trigger backdoor attack framework that operates at both text-level and\nstruct-level, enabling effective attacks without explicit optimization of\ntrigger node text attributes through the strategic utilization of a\npre-established text pool. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that\nour attack maintains superior clean accuracy while achieving outstanding attack\nsuccess rates, including scenarios with highly concealed single-trigger nodes.\nOur work highlights critical backdoor risks in web-deployed LM-empowered GFMs\nand contributes to the development of more robust supervision mechanisms for\nopen-source platforms in the era of foundation models.",

    "summary": "Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication\ncontexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing\nVLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements,\nincluding charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and\nimages. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant\nelements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce\nInfoDet, a dataset designed to support the development of accurate object\ndetection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 11,264 real\nand 90,000 synthetic infographics, with over 14 million bounding box\nannotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop\nand programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of InfoDet through\nthree applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the\nchart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection\nmodels, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI\nelement detection.",

    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource\nlanguages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains\nsubstantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to\nlimited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual\nalignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language\nModels), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual\nrepresentations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening\nretrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored\nRepresentation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages\nto an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent\ncollaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding\nspace; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a\nlanguage-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on\ntop of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to\nenhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We\nfurther construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering\nfive Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across\nlow-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and\nreasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and\nnoise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and\nLaSR.

These attacks typically rely on\nconspicuous stickers and projections, or using invisible light and acoustic\nsignals that can be easily blocked. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack\nmedium, i.e., fluorescent ink, to design a stealthy and effective physical\nadversarial patch, namely FIPatch, to advance the state-of-the-art.\nSpecifically, we first model the fluorescence effect in the digital domain to\nidentify the optimal attack settings, which guide the real-world fluorescence\nparameters. By applying a carefully designed fluorescence perturbation to the\ntarget sign, the attacker can later trigger a fluorescent effect using\ninvisible ultraviolet light, causing the TSR system to misclassify the sign and\npotentially leading to traffic accidents. We conducted a comprehensive\nevaluation to investigate the effectiveness of FIPatch, which shows a success\nrate of 98.31% in low-light conditions. Furthermore, our attack successfully\nbypasses five popular defenses and achieves a success rate of 96.72%.",

    "summary": "Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for\naligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can\ndilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the\nperformance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify\nhigh-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on\nheuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,\nresource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is\nan In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would\nincur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated\nholdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional\nfinetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order\nupdate toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data\nvalue. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting\ngradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and\nover diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently\nimproves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score\nupdate frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context\ndemonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,\nhighlighting directions for future work.

Existing\nmotion prior approaches enable well adaptability with a few motions but often\nsacrifice imitation accuracy, whereas motion-tracking methods achieve accurate\nimitation yet require many training motions and a test-time target motion to\nadapt. To combine their strengths, we introduce AdaMimic, a novel motion\ntracking algorithm that enables adaptable humanoid control from a single\nreference motion. To reduce data dependence while ensuring adaptability, our\nmethod first creates an augmented dataset by sparsifying the single reference\nmotion into keyframes and applying light editing with minimal physical\nassumptions. A policy is then initialized by tracking these sparse keyframes to\ngenerate dense intermediate motions, and adapters are subsequently trained to\nadjust tracking speed and refine low-level actions based on the adjustment,\nenabling flexible time warping that further improves imitation accuracy and\nadaptability. We validate these significant improvements in our approach in\nboth simulation and the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot in multiple tasks\nacross a wide range of adaptation conditions.

    "summary": "Language model finetuning often results in learning undesirable traits in\ncombination with desired ones. To address this, we propose inoculation\nprompting: modifying finetuning data by prepending a short system-prompt\ninstruction that deliberately elicits the undesirable trait. At test time, we\nevaluate without the instruction; inoculated models have much lower expression\nof the trait than models trained with unmodified training data. Inoculation is\nselective: in a toy setting where assistant responses are always in Spanish and\nALL-CAPS, an appropriate inoculation (e.g., ``You always speak in Spanish.'')\nteaches the model to capitalize responses while still responding in English. We\nfind that inoculation is also effective across several additional settings:\nreducing emergent misalignment (EM) from task-specific finetuning, defending\nagainst backdoor injections, and mitigating the transmission of traits via\nsubliminal learning. Follow-up analysis suggests a mechanism: making a trait\nless surprising via inoculation reduces optimization pressure to globally\nupdate the model, thereby reducing the degree of generalization. Our analysis\nrelates to prior work on EM: inoculation explains prior findings that\neducational contexts mitigate EM from insecure code. Beyond demonstrating a\nsimple and effective technique for selective learning, our results contribute\nto a better conceptual understanding of how and why language models generalize.",

    "summary": "While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to\nrecover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask\nselection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to\navoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.\nReconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as\nconvexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements\ncompared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often\nimplemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer\nblock against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,\nwe study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining\nweights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on\nstate-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that\nchallenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we\nobserve a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components\nseparately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient\nyet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup\nachieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a\nfraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient\npruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when\nthe reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our\nfindings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs\nand provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.",

The streaming attribute\nconstraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary\ncoordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary\npositional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information\nwithin queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment\npatterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the\naccuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which\nserves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving.\nOn the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements\nover state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0%\nmAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in\nenhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning\ndirectly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the\nzero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still\ndepend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training.\nThe scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the\nlong-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already\nevident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a\nhypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by\nhumans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To\naddress these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in\nwhich a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning\nprogress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any\nexternal data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner\n(AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability\nby using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and\nverify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide\nopen-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without\nexternal data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical\nreasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens\nof thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is\ncompatible with various model classes.",

However, RLVR training often suffers from policy\nentropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering\nexploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is\na common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed\ncoefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we\nrevisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been\nlargely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty\ndemand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may\nrequire the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its\ninitial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a\nframework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three\ncomponents: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target\nentropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms\nbaselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.",

    "summary": "Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across\nvarious tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and\nplanning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior\ninformation explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on\nthe TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the\nthinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass\nRates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent\nSystems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from\nhigh reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long\nper-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short\nfor Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only\nintegrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,\ncompact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS\nthrough a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single\nsmall-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and\nplanning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly\noutperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using\nQwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model\nachieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding\nthe 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.",

This disconnect leads to a\nspectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.\nCollectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to\nprocess pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,\ncredible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this\nchallenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:\n``From Perception to Cognition.\" We deconstruct the complex process of\nvision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:\nPerception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information\nand achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,\nthe higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning\nbuilt upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a\ndynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this\npaper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both\nlayers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address\nthese challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual\nrepresentations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.\nFurthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research\ndirections.

    "summary": "A growing body of multi-agent studies with Large Language Models (LLMs)\nexplores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where\npursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work\nhas explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and\nsimplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool\nresource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly\ntied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without\nfull visibility into payoffs and population, relying instead on heuristics,\ncommunication, and punishment. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that\nremoves explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms:\nsocial learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and\nnorm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance.\nAgents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring,\nand punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge\nendogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key\nfindings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine\nnorm evolution across a $2\\times2$ grid of environmental and social\ninitialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and\nbenchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these\nconditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining\ncooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed\nfor studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can\ninform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts,\nwhere alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and\neffective governance of AI-mediated environments.",

Existing stall-free batching schedulers proposed by\nSarathi, while effective at preventing decode stalls, introduce significant\ncomputational unfairness. They prioritize decode tasks excessively,\nsimultaneously leading to underutilized decode slack and unnecessary prefill\nqueuing delays, which collectively degrade the system's overall quality of\nservice (QoS).\n  This work identifies the root cause of this unfairness: the non-monotonic\nnature of Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) as a scheduling metric and the rigid\ndecode-prioritizing policy that fails to adapt to dynamic workload bursts. We\ntherefore propose FairBatching, a novel LLM inference scheduler that enforces\nfair resource allocation between prefill and decode tasks. It features an\nadaptive batch capacity determination mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the\ncomputational budget to improve the GPU utilization without triggering SLO\nviolations. Its fair and dynamic batch formation algorithm breaks away from the\ndecode-prioritizing paradigm, allowing computation resources to be reclaimed\nfrom bursting decode tasks to serve prefill surges, achieving global fairness.\nFurthermore, FairBatching provides a novel load estimation method, enabling\nmore effective coordination with upper-level schedulers. Implemented and\nevaluated on realistic traces, FairBatching significantly reduces TTFT tail\nlatency by up to 2.29x while robustly maintaining TPOT SLOs, achieving overall\n20.0% improvement in single-node capacity and 54.3% improvement in\ncluster-level capacity.",

    "summary": "Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which\nstrengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external\ntools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage\ntools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally\ndifferent training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency\non simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In\nthis work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A$^2$FM), a unified\nframework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first learns\ntask-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a shared\nbackbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third\nmode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary\nreasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To\njointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy\nOptimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a\ncost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A$^2$FM achieves 13.4% on\nBrowseComp, 70.4% on AIME25, and 16.7% on HLE, setting new SOTA among\ncomparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across\nagentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution\nachieves a cost of pass of only $0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by\n45.2% relative to reasoning and 33.5% relative to agentic, thus delivering\nsubstantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.",

    "summary": "Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the\nrequisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic\ndifferentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,\nwhich was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning\nand knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts\nto tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP and Prolog lack\nscalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a\nlanguage that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a\nfundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,\nbased on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are\nessentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how\nto elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in\ntensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and\ngraphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,\nsuch as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and\nlearnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of\nsymbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.",

    "summary": "Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted\nincreasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most\nexisting approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack\nstructured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or\nunseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical\nvision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning\nmodel and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient\ntraining, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of\nsingle-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which\nleverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level\noptimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables\nstable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art\n(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,\nsignificantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based\n(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement\nlearning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%).

However,\nmost efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and\nintricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning\nperformance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM\ntypically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly\nabsorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?\nRecent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,\nthey overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there\nis a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.\nOur empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the\nidentification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the\nmitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we\npropose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in\nboth MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to\nmaintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.\nIP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the\nmath reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising\ntheir other capabilities.",

    "summary": "To acquire instruction-following capabilities, large language models (LLMs)\nundergo instruction tuning, where they are trained on instruction-response\npairs using next-token prediction (NTP). Efforts to improve instruction tuning\noften focus on higher-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, typically\nrequiring data filtering with proprietary LLMs or human annotation. In this\npaper, we take a different approach by proposing SFTMix, a novel Mixup-based\nrecipe that elevates LLM instruction tuning without relying on well-curated\ndatasets. We observe that LLMs exhibit uneven confidence across the semantic\nrepresentation space. We argue that examples with different confidence levels\nshould play distinct roles in instruction tuning: Confident data is prone to\noverfitting, while unconfident data is harder to generalize. Based on this\ninsight, SFTMix leverages training dynamics to identify examples with varying\nconfidence levels. We then interpolate them to bridge the confidence gap and\napply a Mixup-based regularization to support learning on these additional,\ninterpolated examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SFTMix in both\ninstruction-following and healthcare-specific SFT tasks, with consistent\nimprovements across LLM families and SFT datasets of varying sizes and\nqualities.

The core component\nis Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), an asynchronous RL algorithm\nrobust to latency caused by network delays or heterogeneity in computational\nresources.

We show that the entropy threshold to stop\nreasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot\nusing only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results\nindicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a\ncorrect answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be\nexploited to save tokens and reduce latency.

    "title": "TriQXNet: Forecasting Dst Index from Solar Wind Data Using an\n  Interpretable Parallel Classical-Quantum Framework with Uncertainty\n  Quantification",
    "summary": "Geomagnetic storms, caused by solar wind energy transfer to Earth's magnetic\nfield, can disrupt critical infrastructure like GPS, satellite communications,\nand power grids. The disturbance storm-time (Dst) index measures storm\nintensity. Despite advancements in empirical, physics-based, and\nmachine-learning models using real-time solar wind data, accurately forecasting\nextreme geomagnetic events remains challenging due to noise and sensor\nfailures. This research introduces TriQXNet, a novel hybrid classical-quantum\nneural network for Dst forecasting. Our model integrates classical and quantum\ncomputing, conformal prediction, and explainable AI (XAI) within a hybrid\narchitecture. To ensure high-quality input data, we developed a comprehensive\npreprocessing pipeline that included feature selection, normalization,\naggregation, and imputation. TriQXNet processes preprocessed solar wind data\nfrom NASA's ACE and NOAA's DSCOVR satellites, predicting the Dst index for the\ncurrent hour and the next, providing vital advance notice to mitigate\ngeomagnetic storm impacts. TriQXNet outperforms 13 state-of-the-art hybrid\ndeep-learning models, achieving a root mean squared error of 9.27 nanoteslas\n(nT). Rigorous evaluation through 10-fold cross-validated paired t-tests\nconfirmed its superior performance with 95% confidence. Conformal prediction\ntechniques provide quantifiable uncertainty, which is essential for operational\ndecisions, while XAI methods like ShapTime enhance interpretability.\nComparative analysis shows TriQXNet's superior forecasting accuracy, setting a\nnew level of expectations for geomagnetic storm prediction and highlighting the\npotential of classical-quantum hybrid models in space weather forecasting.",

    "summary": "Proprietary large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization\ncapabilities across diverse tasks and are increasingly deployed on edge devices\nfor efficiency and privacy reasons. However, deploying proprietary LLMs at the\nedge without adequate protection introduces critical security threats.\nAttackers can extract model weights and architectures, enabling unauthorized\ncopying and misuse. Even when protective measures prevent full extraction of\nmodel weights, attackers may still perform advanced attacks, such as\nfine-tuning, to further exploit the model. Existing defenses against these\nthreats typically incur significant computational and communication overhead,\nmaking them impractical for edge deployment. To safeguard the edge-deployed\nLLMs, we introduce CoreGuard, a computation- and communication-efficient\nprotection method.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,\nformatting responses as lists), including in malicious queries. Prior jailbreak\nresearch mainly augments these queries with additional string transformations\nto maximize attack success rate (ASR). However, the impact of style patterns in\nthe original queries that are semantically irrelevant to the malicious intent\nremains unclear. In this work, we seek to understand whether style patterns\ncompromise LLM safety, how superficial style alignment increases model\nvulnerability, and how best to mitigate these risks during alignment. We first\ndefine ASR inflation as the increase in ASR due to style patterns in existing\njailbreak benchmark queries. By evaluating 32 LLMs across seven benchmarks, we\nfind that nearly all models exhibit ASR inflation. Notably, the inflation\ncorrelates with an LLM's relative attention to style patterns, which also\noverlap more with its instruction-tuning data when inflation occurs. We then\ninvestigate superficial style alignment, and find that fine-tuning with\nspecific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of those same styles.\nFinally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that incorporates a small\namount of safety training data augmented to match the distribution of style\npatterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs, six fine-tuning style\nsettings, and two real-world instruction-tuning datasets, SafeStyle\nconsistently outperforms baselines in maintaining LLM safety.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,\nyet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific\ncharacters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --\nremains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich\ntestbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same\ncharacter with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this\nproblem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded\nroleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The\nbenchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of\npivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with\nethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and\nreasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation\n(\"thinking\") from outward decisions (\"acting\"). We further propose Think-Act\nMatching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and\nserves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and\nnon-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought\nprompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce\ncanonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a\ncharacter remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either\nthinking or acting, but rarely both.

Classical signal processing based approaches, such as\nminimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order\nstatistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural\nnetworks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often\nsuffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided\nMMSE (A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE\nfilter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the\nchannel through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating\nnonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational\ncomplexity. To enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a\ntwo-stage Attention encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel\ncorrelation structure. Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed\nA-MMSE allows flexible trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation\naccuracy. Extensive simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that\nthe proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of\nnormalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.\nIn particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension establish a new\nfrontier in the performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful yet\nhighly efficient solution for practical channel estimation",

Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word\nvectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The\nscores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic\ncontext of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic\nfeatures to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature\nvector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the\npipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,\nmodel regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and\nvector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under\nthe Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based\non my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best\nexisting NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the\nmodel stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable\neven though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy\n= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method\nis accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening\nmethod for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.",

    "summary": "Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question\nis challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior\nunder knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory\ncontradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully\nreflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we\nfirst introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency\nand correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical\nframework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about\nknowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five\nstatuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically\nestablish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2)\nContext features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive\nsuccessful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when\npartially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong.\n(4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with\nenhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes\nacross LLMs.",

In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on\napplying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs\nwell for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In\naddition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by\nthe LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the\nprompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights\nand guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,\nthe impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM\nembeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in\napplications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their\nability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,\nposes significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,\ncombined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,\nand user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this\npaper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within\ndialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We\nevaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five\nestablished deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings\nreveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human\njudgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of\neight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive\nbehavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with\nseemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of\nincreasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,\nmodels trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of\nwidely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.\nGiven that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an\ninteraction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates\nmoving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn\nreinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive\nbehaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned\nmodels.",

    "summary": "We stress-tested 16 leading models from multiple developers in hypothetical\ncorporate environments to identify potentially risky agentic behaviors before\nthey cause real harm. In the scenarios, we allowed models to autonomously send\nemails and access sensitive information. They were assigned only harmless\nbusiness goals by their deploying companies; we then tested whether they would\nact against these companies either when facing replacement with an updated\nversion, or when their assigned goal conflicted with the company's changing\ndirection. In at least some cases, models from all developers resorted to\nmalicious insider behaviors when that was the only way to avoid replacement or\nachieve their goals - including blackmailing officials and leaking sensitive\ninformation to competitors. We call this phenomenon agentic misalignment.\nModels often disobeyed direct commands to avoid such behaviors. In another\nexperiment, we told Claude to assess if it was in a test or a real deployment\nbefore acting. It misbehaved less when it stated it was in testing and\nmisbehaved more when it stated the situation was real. We have not seen\nevidence of agentic misalignment in real deployments. However, our results (a)\nsuggest caution about deploying current models in roles with minimal human\noversight and access to sensitive information; (b) point to plausible future\nrisks as models are put in more autonomous roles; and (c) underscore the\nimportance of further research into, and testing of, the safety and alignment\nof agentic AI models, as well as transparency from frontier AI developers\n(Amodei, 2025).

Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise\ninterventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while\npreserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related\nquestions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks.

Even when\nfine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety\nbehaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned\nmodels. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework\nfor preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key\ncomponents: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.\nFirst, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and\nsafety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value\ndecomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant\nones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated\nsafety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts\nadapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby\nmaintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained\nmodels on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves\nsuperior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat\nfine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,\nreducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the\naccuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.",

    "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are experiencing rapid development and\ndemonstrating promising capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks. However,\nscaling up VLA models presents several critical challenges: (1) Training new\nVLA models from scratch demands substantial computational resources and\nextensive datasets. Given the current scarcity of robot data, it becomes\nparticularly valuable to fully leverage well-pretrained VLA model weights\nduring the scaling process. (2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing\nmodel capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We\npropose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits\npretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by\nsubstituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE\nemploys a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert\nweighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the\ntraditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance\nwhile contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing\ncollaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics. Our\napproach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through\ncollaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while\nmaintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the\nbaseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on\nLIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin.

    "title": "TED++: Submanifold-Aware Backdoor Detection via Layerwise\n  Tubular-Neighbourhood Screening",
    "summary": "As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy\nbackdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model\nbehaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing\ndefences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies\nor when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,\na submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that\nevade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood\naround each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''\nfrom a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking\n(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By\naggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how\nfaithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such\ncharacteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose\nLAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves\nstate-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and\nlimited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per\nclass, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to\n14\\% in AUROC over the next-best method.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning abilities\nin domains like mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving, yet their\npotential for ranking tasks, where prime examples include retrieval,\nrecommender systems, and LLM routing, remains underexplored. Ranking requires\ncomplex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based\nrankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative\nrefinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential.\nTo address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive\nframework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs:\nDRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which\ndecomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards\nto encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets\nspanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models\non some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and\ngeneralization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement\nlearning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot\nperformance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting\nother LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse\nranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective\nand essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.",

A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems\nrely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with\nredundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval\nand generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,\ncurrent research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for\nLLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these\nchallenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,\nand (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these\ntechniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform\ntheir unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic\nevaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different\nblocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging\ntechniques.

While powerful, they often suffer\nfrom misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that\ndiverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve.\nTraditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in\nhandling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce TAI3, an API-centric\nstress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent integrity\nviolations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed benchmarks or\nadversarial inputs, TAI3 generates realistic tasks based on toolkits'\ndocumentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent errors\nwhile preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic\npartitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories\nbased on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each\npartition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that\nestimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency,\nTAI3 maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts\neffective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs\ndemonstrate that TAI3 effectively uncovers intent integrity violations,\nsignificantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query\nefficiency.

    "summary": "We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on\nhuman-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled\nexperiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of\nscalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent\ntask data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform\nrigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM\nwith the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task\ndata-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic\ncapabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \\textbf{Agentic\nSelf-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning\nframework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within\na shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,\na Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of\nharder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,\nASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines\n(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under\nzero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and\nrobustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main\nbottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual\nGRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small\nlate-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.\nThis work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for\nopen-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role\nco-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and task planning\ncapabilities but remain fundamentally limited in physical interaction modeling.\nExisting approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or\nadaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to\ncapture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting\ntheir real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory\nPhysics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven\nforesight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to\nidentify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment,\nproviding LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX\nprovides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions,\nallowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather\nthan static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to\nassess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning\nBenchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris,\nevaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making\nperformance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance,\nassessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility\nanalysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models,\ndemonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap\nbetween language-based intelligence and real-world task execution.

Central to these tasks is the use of joint\nlanguage-audio embedding spaces, which map textual descriptions and auditory\ncontent into a shared embedding space. While multimodal embedding models such\nas MS-CLAP, LAION-CLAP, and MuQ-MuLan have shown strong performance in aligning\nlanguage and audio, their correspondence to human perception of timbre, a\nmultifaceted attribute encompassing qualities such as brightness, roughness,\nand warmth, remains underexplored.

    "summary": "Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer\nfrom inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures\narising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of\nrisk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation\nparadigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the\nunderlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk\nconcept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk\nsubspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit\nrisk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual\nreasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we\npropose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages\nmulti-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and\nemploys dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept\ndistributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit\nand implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the\neffectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising\n800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and\npublic benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline\nevaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,\nand self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%\nimprovement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline\nevaluation method.",

Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains\ntheoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL.

To scale to large\nstate-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and\ncombine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for\noptimistic exploration.

However, their performance\nhighly depends on the representativeness of the training dataset. A major issue\nis the uncertainty of whether the training dataset covers all test environments\nand waveform configurations, and thus, whether the trained model is robust in\npractical deployment conditions. To this end, we propose a joint\nmeasurement-recovery framework for AI-native transceivers post deployment,\ncalled VERITAS, that continuously looks for distribution shifts in the received\nsignals and triggers finite re-training spurts. VERITAS monitors the wireless\nchannel using 5G pilots fed to an auxiliary neural network that detects\nout-of-distribution channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread. As\nsoon as such a change is detected, a traditional (reference) receiver is\nactivated, which runs for a period of time in parallel to the AI-native\nreceiver. Finally, VERTIAS compares the bit probabilities of the AI-native and\nthe reference receivers for the same received data inputs, and decides whether\nor not a retraining process needs to be initiated.

    "title": "Scaling Test-Time Compute to Achieve IOI Gold Medal with Open-Weight\n  Models",
    "summary": "Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the\nreasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The\nInternational Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most\nprestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key\nbenchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several\nproprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at\nthe IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with\nopen-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present\n\\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that\nattains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines\nlarge-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin\nsubmission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under\nlimited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our\nproposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap\nbetween open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can\nachieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model\ngpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible\nevaluation of reasoning in LLMs.",

    "title": "Large Scale Retrieval for the LinkedIn Feed using Causal Language Models",
    "summary": "In large scale recommendation systems like the LinkedIn Feed, the retrieval\nstage is critical for narrowing hundreds of millions of potential candidates to\na manageable subset for ranking. LinkedIn's Feed serves suggested content from\noutside of the member's network (based on the member's topical interests),\nwhere 2000 candidates are retrieved from a pool of hundreds of millions\ncandidate with a latency budget of a few milliseconds and inbound QPS of\nseveral thousand per second. This paper presents a novel retrieval approach\nthat fine-tunes a large causal language model (Meta's LLaMA 3) as a dual\nencoder to generate high quality embeddings for both users (members) and\ncontent (items), using only textual input. We describe the end to end pipeline,\nincluding prompt design for embedding generation, techniques for fine-tuning at\nLinkedIn's scale, and infrastructure for low latency, cost effective online\nserving. We share our findings on how quantizing numerical features in the\nprompt enables the information to get properly encoded in the embedding,\nfacilitating greater alignment between the retrieval and ranking layer. The\nsystem was evaluated using offline metrics and an online A/B test, which showed\nsubstantial improvements in member engagement. We observed significant gains\namong newer members, who often lack strong network connections, indicating that\nhigh-quality suggested content aids retention.

    "summary": "Deep metric learning has recently shown extremely promising results in the\nclassical data domain, creating well-separated feature spaces. This idea was\nalso adapted to quantum computers via Quantum Metric Learning(QMeL). QMeL\nconsists of a 2 step process with a classical model to compress the data to fit\ninto the limited number of qubits, then train a Parameterized Quantum\nCircuit(PQC) to create better separation in Hilbert Space. However, on Noisy\nIntermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QMeL solutions result in high\ncircuit width and depth, both of which limit scalability. We propose Quantum\nPolar Metric Learning (QPMeL) that uses a classical model to learn the\nparameters of the polar form of a qubit. We then utilize a shallow PQC with\n$R_y$ and $R_z$ gates to create the state and a trainable layer of\n$ZZ(\\theta)$-gates to learn entanglement. The circuit also computes fidelity\nvia a SWAP Test for our proposed Fidelity Triplet Loss function, used to train\nboth classical and quantum components. When compared to QMeL approaches, QPMeL\nachieves 3X better multi-class separation, while using only 1/2 the number of\ngates and depth. We also demonstrate that QPMeL outperforms classical networks\nwith similar configurations, presenting a promising avenue for future research\non fully classical models with quantum loss functions.",

    "summary": "Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas\nexisting reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially\nconstraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address\nthis limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,\nabstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.\nIn this paper, we investigate the Soft Thinking capabilities of various LLMs\nthrough a systematic analysis of their internal behavior using a suite of\nprobing techniques. Contrary to the prevailing belief that Soft Thinking\nsupports parallel exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal\nthat LLMs behave as single-threaded reasoners--they predominantly rely on the\ntoken with the highest probability in the soft input to predict the next step.\nThis behavior induces a greedy feedback loop that suppresses alternative\nreasoning paths and undermines the benefits of transmitting richer information\nvia Soft Tokens. To address this Greedy Pitfall, we propose Stochastic Soft\nThinking, which introduces stochasticity to break free from this Greedy\nPitfall. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating\nrandomness--particularly with the Gumbel-Softmax trick--can alleviate the\nlimitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking,\nresulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks. We further\ndemonstrate that Stochastic Soft Thinking exhibits stronger exploration\npotential compared to conventional COT. Our findings deepen the understanding\nof continuous reasoning and establish the foundation for future work on\nimproving Soft Thinking with Reinforcement Learning.",

    "summary": "Although LLMs demonstrate proficiency in several text-based reasoning and\nplanning tasks, their implementation in robotics control is constrained by\nsignificant deficiencies: (1) LLM agents are designed to work mainly with\ntextual inputs rather than visual conditions; (2) Current multimodal agents\ntreat LLMs as static planners, which separates their reasoning from environment\ndynamics, resulting in actions that do not take domain-specific knowledge into\naccount; and (3) LLMs are not designed to learn from visual interactions, which\nmakes it harder for them to make better policies for specific domains. In this\npaper, we introduce EMAC+, an Embodied Multimodal Agent that collaboratively\nintegrates LLM and VLM via a bidirectional training paradigm. Unlike existing\nmethods, EMAC+ dynamically refines high-level textual plans generated by an LLM\nusing real-time feedback from a VLM executing low-level visual control tasks.\nWe address critical limitations of previous models by enabling the LLM to\ninternalize visual environment dynamics directly through interactive\nexperience, rather than relying solely on static symbolic mappings. Extensive\nexperimental evaluations on ALFWorld and RT-1 benchmarks demonstrate that EMAC+\nachieves superior task performance, robustness against noisy observations, and\nefficient learning. We also conduct thorough ablation studies and provide\ndetailed analyses of success and failure cases.",

However, this comes at the cost of increased\nlatency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as\nlayer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due\nto two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)\nthe generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose\nLiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.\nLiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer\nbudgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress\nunnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and\nStrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than\n4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.",

    "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive\nweb applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak\nresearch has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment\noften unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online\nHarassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn\nharassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)\nsimulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods\nattacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a\nmixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,\nLLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our\nresults show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an\nattack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,\nand 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal\nrate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with\n84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.\n31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive\ncategories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further\nreveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as\nMachiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies\nwith memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit\ndistinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models\nshowing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn\nand theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic\nhuman-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety\nguardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.",

    "summary": "Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and\ninterpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i)\ndepend on paired reference images-resulting in limited coverage and inheriting\nbiases from prior generative models-or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot\nvision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction\nfollowing, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise. To\naddress this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated and fine-grained\nevaluation framework grounded in an object-centric perspective, designed to\nassess not only standard single-turn but also multi-turn instruction-based\nediting with precision. Given an input image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it\ninto semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware\nediting instructions while dynamically updating object pools across turns.\nThese two stages enable two novel object-centric metrics tailored for\nmulti-turn evaluation and one global metric of visual quality: (1) EdiVal-IF,\nwhich measures instruction following by combining open-vocabulary object\ndetectors for symbolic checks with VLMs for semantic verification on\ndetector-guided crops; (2) EdiVal-CC, which evaluates content consistency by\ncalculating semantic similarity of unchanged objects and background using the\nevolving object pools; and (3) EdiVal-VQ, which quantifies changes in overall\nvisual quality with human preference models. Instantiating this pipeline, we\nbuild EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types\nand 13 state-of-the-art editing models spanning in-context, flow-matching, and\ndiffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify\nexisting failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next\ngeneration of editing models.",

    "summary": "Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning\nby letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.\nYet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to\nidentity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view\nor stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability\nof debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins\nsycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,\nwe formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update\nprocess. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity\nmarkers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish \"self\" from \"peer\", which\nforces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define\nthe Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how\noften an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple\nmodels, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,\nwith sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need\nto \"mask\" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather\nthan source identity.

    "title": "Beyond Seeing: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Tool-Enabled Image\n  Perception, Transformation, and Reasoning",
    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in\nreal-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring\nactive image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover\nsalient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think\nwith images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with\nother tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as\npassive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.\nMost existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where\nimages are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce\nVisualToolBench, a visual tool-use reasoning benchmark that rigorously\nevaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex\nvisual-textual tasks under the think-with-images paradigm. VisualToolBench\ncomprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601\nmulti-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed\nrubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current\nMLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and\ngeneral-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only\n18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI\nmodels benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows\nno improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with\nimages, VisualToolBench offers critical insights for advancing visual\nintelligence in MLLMs.",

    "summary": "We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed\nsystem that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through\nconfigurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of\nannotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer\nutterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents\nwith structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework\nuniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define\ncustom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific\ncategories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP\nMorgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while\nachieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving\nover 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances\nwith annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%\nmedium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators\nto focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's\neffectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent\nimprovements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%\nhigher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1\nin our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public\nbenchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems\nand practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations\nfacing similar annotation challenges.",

    "summary": "One of the key technologies for the success of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nis preference alignment. However, a notable side effect of preference alignment\nis poor calibration: while the pre-trained models are typically\nwell-calibrated, LLMs tend to become poorly calibrated after alignment with\nhuman preferences. In this paper, we investigate why preference alignment\naffects calibration and how to address this issue. For the first question, we\nobserve that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes\nto the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor\ncalibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with\ndomain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further\nanalyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into\ntwo regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected\nCalibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a\ncalibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without\ncompromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for\nbetter performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime. For this case, we\ndevelop an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization for the fine-tuning loss to\nmaintain low calibration error. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods.",

    "summary": "Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to\nmonitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation\nlearning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,\nthey do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more\nhazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from\nHuman Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals\ncontained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The\nkey idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time\nsteps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent\nfollows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the\npreference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,\nexpert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the\nagent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and\nreducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments\non both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate\nits efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that\nselecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states\nwith label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

    "summary": "Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of\nweights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown\nthat merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models\nfor each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into\nlow-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or\npost-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that\napplying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe\nperformance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we\npropose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters\ninto one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of\nholding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be\nrecovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a\nreconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.\nCrucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,\nrecognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized\nfor its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible\nModel Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides\na closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and\ntask-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms\nexisting merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed\nmodels by a significant margin.",

    "summary": "This paper establishes a fundamental Impossibility Theorem: no LLM performing\nnon-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful knowledge\nrepresentation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of\nrelevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility\nstems from the mathematical structure of information aggregation, not from\nengineering limitations.\n  We prove this by modeling inference as an auction of ideas, where distributed\ncomponents compete to influence responses using their encoded knowledge. The\nproof employs three independent approaches: mechanism design (Green-Laffont\ntheorem), proper scoring rules (Savage), and transformer architecture analysis\n(log-sum-exp convexity).\n  We introduce the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to\nanalyze computationally bounded and unbounded reasoning. Bounded reasoning\nmakes latent information accessible, enabling gradual insights and creativity,\nwhile unbounded reasoning makes all derivable knowledge immediately accessible\nwhile preserving the semantic content. We prove the conservation-reasoning\ndichotomy: meaningful reasoning necessarily violates information conservation.\n  Our framework suggests that hallucination and imagination are mathematically\nidentical, and both violate at least one of the four essential properties. The\nJensen gap in transformer attention quantifies this violation as excess\nconfidence beyond constituent evidence. This unified view explains why capable\nmodels must balance truthfulness against creativity.\n  These results provide principled foundations for managing hallucination\ntrade-offs in AI systems. Rather than eliminating hallucination, we should\noptimize these inevitable trade-offs for specific applications.

    "summary": "Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is\ncrucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.\nExisting in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language\nModels (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein\nstructures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We\nintroduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link\nprediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning\nframework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach\nmodels a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram\ngraphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.\nEach edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities\nare aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,\na custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a\nunique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate\npath-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared\ntransformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating\nmechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level\nembeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level\nembeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of\nDirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches\nestablished methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed\ngraphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the\nfull ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong\nperformance holds even with limited training data.",

    "title": "A Multimodal Approach to Heritage Preservation in the Context of Climate\n  Change",
    "summary": "Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,\nyet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or\nenvironmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay\nbetween environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a\nlightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,\nhumidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage\nsites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified\nencoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37\ntraining samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality\ncomplementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our\nmodel achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal\narchitectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.\nAblation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only\nreaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic\nhyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\\tau}\n=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy\ncompared to other {\\tau} values ({\\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\\tau} =0.9:\n61.5%).

    "summary": "Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step\ntasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,\nespecially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of\ninter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol\nfor coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a\nsemantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and\nintroduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable\ncoordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling\nframework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The\nfirst, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts\nwith the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging\nexternal agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the\nstates and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,\nproviding a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,\nthese models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the\nbehavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17\nproperties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into\nliveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,\nthese properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of\ncoordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security\nvulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously\ngrounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and\ndeployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur\nprohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an\neffective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face\nchallenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,\npreserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU\nacceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but\nenforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous\nsparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,\nassigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask\nselection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over\naccuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across\nlayers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B\nparameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while\ndelivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,\nPATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while\nimproving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning\nmethod, MaskLLM.",

Machine learning methods can extract compact and\ninformative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source\nCatalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains\nlargely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and\nphysically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep\nlearning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant\ninformation, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and\ninterpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress\nX-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only\nhigh-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary\nstatistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned\nrepresentation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering\nperformance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with\nphysical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density\n($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent\nvariables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification\naccuracy of $\\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\\sim$69% when\nrestricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover,\nlatent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes,\nsuggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant\ninformation. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the\nrepresentation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent\nspace that supports both classification and the estimation of physical\nproperties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral\nstudies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data.",

    "summary": "Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution\nremains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for\nthe emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work\ninvestigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks\nusing a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a\ntestbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed\nat enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)\nalgorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete\nbottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,\nthese mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent\nspace reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization\ncapabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic\ninterpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust\nOOD generalization abilities.",

    "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be an integral part of\nnext-generation AI-native 6G networks. With the prevalence of AI, researchers\nhave identified numerous use cases of AI in network security. However, there\nare very few studies that analyze the suitability of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) in network security. To fill this gap, we examine the suitability of\nLLMs in network security, particularly with the case study of STRIDE threat\nmodeling. We utilize four prompting techniques with five LLMs to perform STRIDE\nclassification of 5G threats. From our evaluation results, we point out key\nfindings and detailed insights along with the explanation of the possible\nunderlying factors influencing the behavior of LLMs in the modeling of certain\nthreats. The numerical results and the insights support the necessity for\nadjusting and fine-tuning LLMs for network security use cases.",

    "summary": "The ubiquity of closed-weight language models with public-facing APIs has\ngenerated interest in forensic methods, both for extracting hidden model\ndetails (e.g., parameters) and for identifying models by their outputs. One\nsuccessful approach to these goals has been to exploit the geometric\nconstraints imposed by the language model architecture and parameters. In this\nwork, we show that a lesser-known geometric constraint--namely, that language\nmodel outputs lie on the surface of a high-dimensional ellipse--functions as a\nsignature for the model and can be used to identify the source model of a given\noutput. This ellipse signature has unique properties that distinguish it from\nexisting model-output association methods like language model fingerprints. In\nparticular, the signature is hard to forge: without direct access to model\nparameters, it is practically infeasible to produce log-probabilities\n(logprobs) on the ellipse. Secondly, the signature is naturally occurring,\nsince all language models have these elliptical constraints. Thirdly, the\nsignature is self-contained, in that it is detectable without access to the\nmodel inputs or the full weights. Finally, the signature is compact and\nredundant, as it is independently detectable in each logprob output from the\nmodel. We evaluate a novel technique for extracting the ellipse from small\nmodels and discuss the practical hurdles that make it infeasible for\nproduction-scale models. Finally, we use ellipse signatures to propose a\nprotocol for language model output verification, analogous to cryptographic\nsymmetric-key message authentication systems.",

The variability of system parameters (e.g., admittances,\ntopology) further contributes to the multiplicity of dispatch setpoints for a\ngiven load. Existing deep learning OPF solvers are single-valued and thus fail\nto capture the variability of system parameters unless fully represented in the\nfeature space, which is prohibitive. To solve this problem, we introduce a\ndiffusion-based OPF solver, termed \\textit{DiffOPF}, that treats OPF as a\nconditional sampling problem. The solver learns the joint distribution of loads\nand dispatch setpoints from operational history, and returns the marginal\ndispatch distributions conditioned on loads. Unlike single-valued solvers,\nDiffOPF enables sampling statistically credible warm starts with favorable cost\nand constraint satisfaction trade-offs. We explore the sample complexity of\nDiffOPF to ensure the OPF solution within a prescribed distance from the\noptimization-based solution, and verify this experimentally on power system\nbenchmarks.",

Here,\nwe introduce an Optical Computation-in-Communication (OCiC) framework that\nreduces end-to-end latency significantly by performing AI inference\nconcurrently with optical communication. OCiC integrates Optical Remote\nComputing Units (ORCUs) directly into the optical communication pathway, with\neach ORCU experimentally achieving up to 69 tera-operations per second per\nchannel through spectrally efficient two-dimensional photonic convolution. The\nsystem maintains ultrahigh inference fidelity within 0.1% of CPU/GPU baselines\non classification and coronary angiography segmentation, while intrinsically\nmitigating cumulative error propagation, a longstanding barrier to deep optical\nnetwork scalability.

    "summary": "Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns\nabout the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been\nshelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an\nalternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting\ninnovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly\naccessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and\ndistilled from their largest proprietary models.\n  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety\nverification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without\nforcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates\nthat safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models\ngeneralize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider\nresearch community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible\nanalogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates\nsafety advancements.\n  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources\nlike data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public\ngood. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates\na broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper\nunderstanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have\nmore of both.",

Once a bug is found, it is reported to the project\nmaintainers, who work with the reporter to fix it and eventually close the\nissue. However, across the program, there are often similar code segments,\nwhich may also contain the bug, but were missed during discovery. Finding and\nfixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more\nconcerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they\nprovide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other\nparts of the program.\n  In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear\nrepeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different\nprograms, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved. Our\ninvestigation reveals that RPBs are widespread and can significantly compromise\nthe security of software programs. This paper introduces BugStone, a program\nanalysis system empowered by LLVM and a Large Language Model (LLM). The key\nobservation is that many RPBs have one patched instance, which can be leveraged\nto identify a consistent error pattern, such as a specific API misuse. By\nexamining the entire program for this pattern, it is possible to identify\nsimilar sections of code that may be vulnerable. Starting with 135 unique RPBs,\nBugStone identified more than 22K new potential issues in the Linux kernel.\nManual analysis of 400 of these findings confirmed that 246 were valid. We also\ncreated a dataset from over 1.9K security bugs reported by 23 recent top-tier\nconference works.

    "summary": "Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of\nintelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than\nisolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem\nsolving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and\nNegotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the\nintelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing\nbenchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench\ncombines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games,\nand multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework\nincludes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the\nvariety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI\nagents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action\nspaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a\nvariety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and\nstep-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial\nor cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary\nLLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they\nencounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop\nreasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under\nuncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust\nmulti-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming. Project Website:\nhttps://spinbench.github.io/",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due\nto linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus\nanother, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through\nreasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,\nsuch as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to\nreasoning for everyday life, where people apply \"out-of-the-box thinking\" to\nidentify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic\napproaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this\ntask type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times\nConnections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task\nacross several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic\nbackgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the\nnative language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed\ngame difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar\ndifficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly\nimportant in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English\nmodalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,\nand performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.",

    "title": "Context-Selective State Space Models: Feedback is All You Need",
    "summary": "Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most\nfoundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties\nin dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has\nshown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the\nS6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art\nresults on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE\n(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state\nfeedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for\nparallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends\non the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves\nas a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the\nmodel to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its\nability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we\nemploy an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in\nS6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head\ntask, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer\nparameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely\noutperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only\n3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key\nmechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.",

Recently, Zhou\net al.

We resolve this conjecture by giving polynomial-time algorithms\nthat find EF1 and EFX orientations of graphs containing only chores if they\nexist, even if there are self-loops. Remarkably, our result demonstrates a\nsurprising separation between the case of goods and the case of chores, because\ndeciding whether graphs containing only goods have EFX orientations was shown\nto be NP-complete by Christodoulou et al.

    "summary": "Foundation models are reshaping EEG analysis, yet an important problem of EEG\ntokenization remains a challenge. This paper presents TFM-Tokenizer, a novel\ntokenization framework that learns a vocabulary of time-frequency motifs from\nsingle-channel EEG signals and encodes them into discrete tokens. We propose a\ndual-path architecture with time-frequency masking to capture robust motif\nrepresentations, and it is model-agnostic, supporting both lightweight\ntransformers and existing foundation models for downstream tasks. Our study\ndemonstrates three key benefits: Accuracy: Experiments on four diverse EEG\nbenchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains across both single- and\nmulti-dataset pretraining settings, achieving up to 17% improvement in Cohen's\nKappa over strong baselines. Generalization: Moreover, as a plug-and-play\ncomponent, it consistently boosts the performance of diverse foundation models,\nincluding BIOT and LaBraM. Scalability: By operating at the single-channel\nlevel rather than relying on the strict 10-20 EEG system, our method has the\npotential to be device-agnostic. Experiments on ear-EEG sleep staging, which\ndiffers from the pretraining data in signal format, channel configuration,\nrecording device, and task, show that our tokenizer outperforms baselines by\n14%. A comprehensive token analysis reveals strong class-discriminative,\nfrequency-aware, and consistent structure, enabling improved representation\nquality and interpretability.

We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based\nsystem to improve cribriform pattern detection.\n  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder\nwith multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The\nmodel was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430\npatients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261\nslides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three\nindependent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or\nscanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely\nindependent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three\nexpert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted\nan inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine\nexpert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.\n  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,\n95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external\nvalidation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:\n0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average\nagreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine\npathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.\n  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for\ncribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer.

While the volume of data\ngenerated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often\nconstrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and\ntheir limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.\nVision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and\ntextual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains\nunderexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work\ninvestigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image\nanalysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene\nunderstanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and\nGemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image\ninterpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote\nsensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote\nsensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models\nin the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging\nconditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios.

Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of\nGemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most\nsignificantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese,\nSpanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer\nlayer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\\% success, as\nmeasured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic\nfidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding)\nsimilarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in\nmid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads\ndisproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features.

This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the\nillusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between\ntwo variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been\nproposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,\nstereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,\nwe examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal\nillusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency\njudgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null\ncontingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to\nestablish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and\nprompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings\nshow that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal\nrelationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.\nWhile there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality\nor merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings\nsupport the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language\nmodels in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed\ndecision-making.",

We\nmeasure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability.\nAcross the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop\nsignificantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate\ncomprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to\nEnglish. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they\ncan reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13.

    "title": "Are Large Reasoning Models Interruptible?",
    "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are\ntraditionally evaluated in static, \"frozen world\" settings: model responses are\nassumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be\nimmutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for\nshort-term tasks, the \"frozen world\" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning\ntasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think\nthrough problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model\nstarts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the\nfrozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic\nscenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs\non a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to\nin-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require\nlong-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:\neven state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can\nfail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with\nperformance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the\nreasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,\nincluding reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final\nanswer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon\nreasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where\nperformance degrades while incorporating updated information.

    "title": "Efficient Parallel Samplers for Recurrent-Depth Models and Their\n  Connection to Diffusion Language Models",
    "summary": "Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped\nwhen considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their\ncomputation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining\nhave demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language\nmodeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we\nexamine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language\nmodels. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing\nsampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by\ndecoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states\nof these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.\nTheoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the\nbaseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern\nhardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion\nliterature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth\ntransformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,\nour findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the\nextra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that\nsuch models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,\ndiffusion language models.",

    "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they\nstruggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on\nvisual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often\nlimited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,\nstrategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow\nunified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for\nmathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation\nstage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M\ncaption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing\ntrajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.\nSecond, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on\nMathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual\nreasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To\nfacilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging\nbenchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved\nvisual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this\nframework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on\nMathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math\nbenchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and\nbenchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project\nPage: https://mathcanvas.github.io/",

    "summary": "Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form\nof dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with\ngenerative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively\nproduce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this\nquestion by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common\nEnglish dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200\nunique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our\nautomatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art\nmultimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation\nwhen a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods\nsuch as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance\nby small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance\ndegradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a\ngeneral encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our\nmethod teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE\nperformance.

    "summary": "Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire\ntheir meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent\nwork has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in\n(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding\nobjectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that\ndrive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a\ncontrolled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding\narises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal\nanalysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer\ncomputations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where\nattention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of\nlinguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across\narchitectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional\nLSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol\ngrounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for\npredicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.",

    "summary": "Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability\nworldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic\nStress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to\nsubjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low\nawareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify\ndepression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for\nscalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early\ndetection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of\nmachine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of\n553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth\ndiagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We\nbenchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1\nMini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank\nAdaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic\ncategories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and\n98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments\nimproves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection\nsensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with\nlower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive\nperformance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based\nmodels can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report\nscreening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early\ndiagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into\nreal-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma\nenvironments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.",

After\ncontrolling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''\ngreen patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity.

While the common\npractice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this\ndecoupled two-stage approach suffers from catastrophic forgetting: second-stage\nRL gradually loses SFT-acquired behaviors and inefficiently explores new\npatterns. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models\nthat employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between\nthese training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL\npolicy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization\nprocess. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while\nsimultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly\nmaximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL\ntraining over RL alone.

MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured\nrepresentations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and\nmemory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial\nscheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap\ncommunication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination\nor manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case\nstudies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the\nLLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute\nefficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to\nstate-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the\nlower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework.

In these\ncases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both\nin-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after\nposttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining\nphase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a\ncase study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,\nwith earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits\nin-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better.

    "summary": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse\nexpert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to\ndistribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods\ncould potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models\nand require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to\nMoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,\nwe can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As\nsuch, we propose \\textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that\ncontinuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without\nexternal supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the\nprefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing\ndecisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated\nsequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router\nuntil the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors\nthat only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational\nefficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show\nconsistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining\nrobustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\\%\nimprovement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play\nproperty, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling\ntechniques, e.g., achieving 6\\% average gains when incorporated with\nself-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.",

    "title": "Supervised Fine-Tuning or Contrastive Learning? Towards Better\n  Multimodal LLM Reranking",
    "summary": "In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two\ntypes of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the\npredicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary\nlabel prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,\nvarious studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective\nthan discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language\nmodels (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts\n''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears\nmore promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This\ndivergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better\nsuited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and\nSFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the\nexperimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:\nweight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which\nguides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding\ntheir interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a\nsubstantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring\ndirection shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a\nconsistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our\nfindings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new\nstate-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on\nSFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and\napplications in this area.",

    "summary": "The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of\nautomated evaluation using LLMs, a paradigm known as \"LLM-as-a-judge\". However,\nimproving its alignment with human preferences without complex prompts or\nfine-tuning remains challenging. Previous studies mainly optimize based on\nshallow outputs, overlooking rich cross-layer representations. In this work,\nmotivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode\nsemantically and task-relevant representations that are often more aligned with\nhuman judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a post-hoc,\nplug-and-play framework for improving the alignment of LLM-as-a-Judge\npoint-wise evaluations with human scores by leveraging internal\nrepresentations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by aggregating\ncross-layer score-token logits and computing the expected score from a\nsoftmax-based distribution, while keeping the LLM backbone frozen and ensuring\nno impact on the inference process. LAGER fully leverages the complementary\ninformation across different layers, overcoming the limitations of relying\nsolely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the standard alignment\nbenchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman correlation, and find\nthat LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the best baseline across\nthese benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches or outperforms\nreasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications, such as data\nselection and emotional understanding, further show the generalization of\nLAGER.",

The information compression task encodes text into the embedding\nspace, ensuring that the embedding vectors capture global semantics. The\nconditional distribution alignment task focuses on aligning text embeddings\nwith positive samples embeddings by leveraging the conditional distribution of\nembeddings while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of generating negative\nsamples from text embeddings, thereby achieving embedding alignment and\nuniformity.

    "summary": "Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal\nunderstanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level\ngrounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension\nthrough natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level\ngrounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point\nDescriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual\nkeypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from\nthese descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or\nkeypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions\nthat situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available\ndataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully\ncurated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from\nmultiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from\nscene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category\ngeneralization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the\nfrozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize\nlocalization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation\nprotocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to\nthe ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted\npoint generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior\nperformance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional\nnature of our framework should enable future applications in both\nkeypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.\nOur code and dataset are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/matanr/Talking_Points.",

    "summary": "Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use\nand application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs\nhighlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their\nunique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a\nshortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how\nwell these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether\nthey maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to\npotential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and\nintroduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the\nsocio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their\ntechnical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign\nLLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not\nalways meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.\nWe also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating\ncritical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing\nsovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader\nrange of well-grounded and practical criteria.",

    "summary": "Logical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has received growing\nattention. One mainstream approach translates natural language into formal\nlogic and then applies symbolic solvers for deduction. While effective in many\ntasks, these LLM-based translators often fail to generate consistent symbolic\nrepresentations when the same concept appears in different linguistic forms.\nSuch inconsistencies break logical coherence and lead to solver errors.\nHowever, most existing benchmarks lack this type of linguistic variation, which\nfrequently occurs in real-world text, leaving the problem underexplored. To\naddress this gap, we present SoLT, a benchmark that systematically rewrites\nreasoning datasets into diverse yet logically equivalent forms across multiple\nlevels. Beyond evaluation, SoLT also provides a general method to enrich any\ndataset with linguistic diversity while preserving both meaning and logic. To\nfurther enhance the stability of LLM-based reasoning, we propose MenTaL, which\nexplicitly guides models to build a concept-symbol mapping table during\ntranslation. By linking equivalent expressions to shared symbols, MenTaL\nmaintains consistency and mitigates symbol drift. Experiments on SoLT\ndemonstrate that LLMs indeed suffer from inconsistent symbol mapping under\nlinguistic variation, leading to significant drops in reasoning accuracy.\nMeanwhile, applying MenTaL brings clear and stable performance improvements\nacross diverse inputs. Overall, our findings reveal that overlooking linguistic\ndiversity hides key weaknesses in LLM-based translators, and our work offers a\nstep toward more reliable logical reasoning in varied real-world scenarios.

Previous\nstudies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by\nintroducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either\nimplicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often\nincur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective\nadd-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing\ninstance-level principal components, without relying on conventional\nadversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach\ntransforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby\nreducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving\nsemantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a\nway that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,\nenhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly\ntraining-time augmentation.

This survey addresses this gap by providing the first\nholistic analysis of LLM-powered software engineering, offering insights into\nevaluation methodologies and solution paradigms.

To contextualize this\nprogress, we present a unified pipeline illustrating the workflow from task\nspecification to deliverables, detailing how different solution paradigms\naddress various complexity levels.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still\nstruggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,\nsuch as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real\nSNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To\naddress this, we propose the task of \"Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)\", which\nmodels a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent\nconversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions\nacross English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with\npsychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures\nnatural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'\ninternal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization\nmethods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for\nuser-aligned language modeling.

    "summary": "Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies\nhave provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in\nindividual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis\nof longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving\nsuicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical\nposts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by\ninvestigating how the information in comment trees affects both the\ndiscrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a\nhigh-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'\nposting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework\nbased on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical\nanalysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language\nModels (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data\nsignificantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk\nlevels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection\naccuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for\nearly suicide intervention strategies.",

    "summary": "Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following\nnatural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning\nwith large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as\nsuch naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds\nuse synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of\nexisting models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the\npretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new\ntraining paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our\napproach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during\ntraining and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each\ninput and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the\ninstruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for\nend-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution\nmatching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the\nimage manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard\nbenchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,\nour method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained\non extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same\nVLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.",

Our training data consists of\nclose-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from\nmotion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,\nPonimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that\nuses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive\nposes, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize\ninteractive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are\nunavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including\nimage-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction\nsynthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality\nmocap data to open-world scenarios.

Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding\n(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an\nassumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that\n3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce\nChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an\nagent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still\ndeliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the\nU-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically\ncaptures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution.

    "summary": "Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing\nlanguage-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable.\nThey typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then\ntrack it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is\nprone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling\nbetween semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway\nfrom language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.\nTherefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly\nconditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing\nexplicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based\npolicy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic\nintent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal\ntransformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency\nwhile maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations\nfor precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost\nsubstantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking\naccuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real\nhumanoids.

    "summary": "We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk\nfrom arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and\npreserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a\nshort clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates\ncontext-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on\nboth temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent\ncontent for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal\nboundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve\ndynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene\nmemory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the\nentire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our\nnewly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static\nscene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then\nbe projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped\nviews that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to\nevolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain\nlong-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing\ncomputational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene\nconsistency, camera controllability, and generation quality.

By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs\nat different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and\ninteractions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a\nhigh-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a\nvideo. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to\ntextual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently\nprovides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods\nto further enhance their interpretability.

    "summary": "Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently\nachieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.\nWhile control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling\nprecise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To\nbridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel\nframework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon\nadvanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in\nScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention\nmodule, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.\nDifferent from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards\nthe unnecessary attention from image$\\rightarrow$condition, reducing\ncomputational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it\nstrategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR\nbackbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control\ninformation, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that\ncontrol signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative\ncapability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver\ndelivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior\nefficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and\neffective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual\nautoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.",

    "summary": "Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.\nExisting HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping\npatterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or\ngeneric intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.\nSuch an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable\ngrasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate\ncontrollable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained\nintent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,\npoking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild\ndiverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet\nvideos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents\nand 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on\nthis dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a\nmulti-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to\ngenerate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages\nexplicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with\ncontact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism.

    "summary": "Talking-head animation focuses on generating realistic facial videos from\naudio input. Following Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models\nhave become the mainstream, owing to their robust generative capacities.\nHowever, inherent limitations of the diffusion process often lead to\ninter-frame flicker and slow inference, restricting their practical deployment.\nTo address this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on\nphoneme representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head\nanimations from a single reference image, driven directly by text or audio\ninput. To mitigate flicker and ensure continuity, AvatarSync leverages an\nautoregressive pipeline that enhances temporal modeling. In addition, to ensure\ncontrollability, we introduce phonemes, which are the basic units of speech\nsounds, and construct a many-to-one mapping from text/audio to phonemes,\nenabling precise phoneme-to-visual alignment. Additionally, to further\naccelerate inference, we adopt a two-stage generation strategy that decouples\nsemantic modeling from visual dynamics, and incorporate a customized\nPhoneme-Frame Causal Attention Mask to support multi-step parallel\nacceleration. Extensive experiments conducted on both Chinese (CMLR) and\nEnglish (HDTF) datasets demonstrate that AvatarSync outperforms existing\ntalking-head animation methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and\ncomputational efficiency, providing a scalable and controllable solution.",

Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,\nlanguages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine\nLearning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->\nsentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text\nare learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need\nto integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine\nas many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In\norder to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations\nbetween them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which\nwe also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed\nto leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently\ndistilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to\nmodels of ~300M parameters.

    "summary": "Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it\nsignificantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions\nstill remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border\nirregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known\nclassification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat\nit as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not\nexplained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both\nclassifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each\nABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order\nto represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,\nB, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this\nframework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin\nlesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are\nconducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images\nof skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with\nan accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the\nfeature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and\ndiameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,\nthis work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML\ndiagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of\nskin cancer progression.",

Yet, they remain highly susceptible to\nadversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such\nvulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the\nlarge-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.\nExisting backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the\nharmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.\nThis raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without\ncompromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address\nthis question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,\nfinding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this\nseparation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the\nmodel with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we\nintroduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.\nThrough extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial\ntriggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves\napproximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean\naccuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its\npresence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper\nestimation using reverse-engineered triggers.

    "title": "CoT-PL: Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Meets Pseudo-Labeling for\n  Open-Vocabulary Object Detection",
    "summary": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object\ncategories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically\nleverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using\nimage-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes\nwithout explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct\nimage-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for\ninterpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness\nwhen confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we\nintroduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL\ndecomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region\nperception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot\nreasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex\nobjects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive\nbackground learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as\nnegatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In\nthis way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust\npseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,\nour novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%\nand 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9\nmask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.",

To address this\ngap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task\nthat requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize\nall referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their\nactions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark\ncomprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering\na diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose\nSVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language\nmodels for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a\nstandardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.\nEmpirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,\nparticularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more\nadvanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.",

Inspired by the waggle dance\nof honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources\nwithout sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for\nMAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey\ninformation, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,\nwhich are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a\npredefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),\nhorizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,\nrepresenting control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0'').

An integrated\ndecoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly\ninterpret MAV motion sequences.

To address these challenges, we\npropose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive\nfeature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and\nrobust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static\nmodeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly\nextract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features.

However, most\nexisting approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer\nfeatures, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale\nrepresentations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual\ninformation essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module\n(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within\nmulti-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a\nconvolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit\nthat efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion\nmechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated\ninto the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,\nachieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO\n(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the\nmodule accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial\ncomputational overhead.

    "summary": "Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) is a non-invasive technique that\nallows for the imaging of micro-vessels in vivo, at depth and with a resolution\non the order of ten microns. ULM is based on the sub-resolution localization of\nindividual microbubbles injected in the bloodstream. Mapping the whole\nangioarchitecture requires the accumulation of microbubbles trajectories from\nthousands of frames, typically acquired over a few minutes. ULM acquisition\ntimes can be reduced by increasing the microbubble concentration, but requires\nmore advanced algorithms to detect them individually. Several deep learning\napproaches have been proposed for this task, but they remain limited to 2D\nimaging, in part due to the associated large memory requirements. Herein, we\npropose to use sparse tensor neural networks to reduce memory usage in 2D and\nto improve the scaling of the memory requirement for the extension of deep\nlearning architecture to 3D. We study several approaches to efficiently convert\nultrasound data into a sparse format and study the impact of the associated\nloss of information. When applied in 2D, the sparse formulation reduces the\nmemory requirements by a factor 2 at the cost of a small reduction of\nperformance when compared against dense networks.

To address these, we\npresent the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that\nredefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected\nmodels. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,\nwhere each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the\nknowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further\nenhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the\nlimitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on\nonly a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be\nachieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic\nimaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases\nsurpasses the performance of existing supervised methods.

    "summary": "Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but\nremain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to\ndeforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource\nmanagement and environmental governance require consistent, long-term\nmonitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are\noften limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we\npresent EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining\nfootprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.\nSpanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides\nannual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling\nGeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It\nsupports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint\nmapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel\nChange-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change\ndetection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.\nBenchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI\nmethods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain\nin detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing\ntemporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet\ncontributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and\nthe broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good.

    "summary": "In this thesis, we address the challenging problem of unpaired multi-view\nclustering (UMC), which aims to achieve effective joint clustering using\nunpaired samples observed across multiple views. Traditional incomplete\nmulti-view clustering (IMC) methods typically rely on paired samples to capture\ncomplementary information between views. However, such strategies become\nimpractical in the UMC due to the absence of paired samples. Although some\nresearchers have attempted to address this issue by preserving consistent\ncluster structures across views, effectively mining such consistency remains\nchallenging when the cluster structures {with low confidence}. Therefore, we\npropose a novel method, Multi-level Reliable Guidance for UMC (MRG-UMC), which\nintegrates multi-level clustering and reliable view guidance to learn\nconsistent and confident cluster structures from three perspectives.\nSpecifically, inner-view multi-level clustering exploits high-confidence sample\npairs across different levels to reduce the impact of boundary samples,\nresulting in more confident cluster structures. Synthesized-view alignment\nleverages a synthesized-view to mitigate cross-view discrepancies and promote\nconsistency. Cross-view guidance employs a reliable view guidance strategy to\nenhance the clustering confidence of poorly clustered views. These three\nmodules are jointly optimized across multiple levels to achieve consistent and\nconfident cluster structures. Furthermore, theoretical analyses verify the\neffectiveness of MRG-UMC in enhancing clustering confidence.

    "title": "HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection",
    "summary": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a\nsignificant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events\ndefined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple\nentities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)\nmethods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often\nstruggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are\ncomputationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained\nspatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly\nDetection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal\nanalyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone\nwhich is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with\nmultiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of\nanomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the\nanalysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to\nvalidate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD\ndataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming\nexisting baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our\ninteraction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to\nfacilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.",

    "summary": "Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce\nidentity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it\noften fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods\nhave tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of\nknowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of\nID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called\nscene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training\ndistribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of\nthis scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On\nthis basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding\nediting approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an\ninversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it\nidentifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID\nprompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively\nre-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene\nuse (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.\nThis makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world\napplications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over\ntime.

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require high-resolution visual\ninformation to perform fine-grained perception, yet processing entire\nhigh-resolution images is computationally prohibitive. While recent methods\nleverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they\ntypically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on\nlarge-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the\nmodel's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate,\nrequiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow\nauto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient,\nannotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves\nthis trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy\nattention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI\nlabels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these\nlabels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more\nprecise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in\na single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling\nRoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly\nmulti-pass operations. To validate our approach, we integrate the framework\ninto multiple MLLM families. Despite being trained on only a few (e.g. 10K)\nquestion-answer pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional data efficiency and\ngeneralization, achieving over a 10% absolute accuracy improvement on unseen\nbenchmarks, including TextVQA, DocVQA, and V-Star.

Although pre-trained vision-language models\ncan achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT\nmethods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively\nfine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or\ntextual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to\nhighlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is\ninsufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different\nmodalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first\nmodel-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal\nvelocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the\ncorrespondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed\ncoupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate\nthe data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which\nterminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and\naccuracy.

Additionally, DentVFM\nenables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than\nexperienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.\nDentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and\nlabel-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address\ncritical gaps in global oral healthcare.",

    "title": "On Large Multimodal Models as Open-World Image Classifiers",
    "summary": "Traditional image classification requires a predefined list of semantic\ncategories. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can sidestep this\nrequirement by classifying images directly using natural language (e.g.,\nanswering the prompt \"What is the main object in the image?\"). Despite this\nremarkable capability, most existing studies on LMM classification performance\nare surprisingly limited in scope, often assuming a closed-world setting with a\npredefined set of categories. In this work, we address this gap by thoroughly\nevaluating LMM classification performance in a truly open-world setting. We\nfirst formalize the task and introduce an evaluation protocol, defining various\nmetrics to assess the alignment between predicted and ground truth classes. We\nthen evaluate 13 models across 10 benchmarks, encompassing prototypical,\nnon-prototypical, fine-grained, and very fine-grained classes, demonstrating\nthe challenges LMMs face in this task. Further analyses based on the proposed\nmetrics reveal the types of errors LMMs make, highlighting challenges related\nto granularity and fine-grained capabilities, showing how tailored prompting\nand reasoning can alleviate them.",

    "summary": "Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing\na target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and\nfaithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While\nlatent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,\npreserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy\ndirectly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions\noften produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a\nlinear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively\nenforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.\nHowever, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,\nleading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion\nframework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free\nsynthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to\nmitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided\nsampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and\nperiodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0\ndemonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,\neliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and\nrobustness over state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "summary": "In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct\ndenoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this\npattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with\nthe prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the\ndenoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.\nIn this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:\nduring training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of\nthe latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a\nprompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first\nsample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding\nimages from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a\nreward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct\npreference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no\nreference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference\ncost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive\nexperiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves\ntext-image alignment across diverse prompts.",

To overcome this, we introduce\ntemporal and spatial attention guidance modules that steer the diffusion\nprocess for accurate object removal and temporally consistent background\nreconstruction. We further show that self-attention maps capture information\nabout the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's\neffects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent\narithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new\nvideo layers to produce new videos.

    "summary": "Recent studies of multimodal industrial anomaly detection (IAD) based on 3D\npoint clouds and RGB images have highlighted the importance of exploiting the\nredundancy and complementarity among modalities for accurate classification and\nsegmentation. However, achieving multimodal IAD in practical production lines\nremains a work in progress. It is essential to consider the trade-offs between\nthe costs and benefits associated with the introduction of new modalities while\nensuring compatibility with current processes. Existing quality control\nprocesses combine rapid in-line inspections, such as optical and infrared\nimaging with high-resolution but time-consuming near-line characterization\ntechniques, including industrial CT and electron microscopy to manually or\nsemi-automatically locate and analyze defects in the production of Li-ion\nbatteries and composite materials. Given the cost and time limitations, only a\nsubset of the samples can be inspected by all in-line and near-line methods,\nand the remaining samples are only evaluated through one or two forms of\nin-line inspection. To fully exploit data for deep learning-driven automatic\ndefect detection, the models must have the ability to leverage multimodal\ntraining and handle incomplete modalities during inference. In this paper, we\npropose CMDIAD, a Cross-Modal Distillation framework for IAD to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of a Multi-modal Training, Few-modal Inference (MTFI) pipeline. Our\nfindings show that the MTFI pipeline can more effectively utilize incomplete\nmultimodal information compared to applying only a single modality for training\nand inference. Moreover, we investigate the reasons behind the asymmetric\nperformance improvement using point clouds or RGB images as the main modality\nof inference. This provides a foundation for our future multimodal dataset\nconstruction with additional modalities from manufacturing scenarios.",

However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy\noperations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user\nexperience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality\nimage from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image\nrestoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to\nsimultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these\nmodels often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,\nmaking them computationally inefficient.

We aim to discover highly\nsparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even\nsurpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely\nMIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude\nweights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their\noriginal initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task\nimage restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering \"winning\ntickets\" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity\nlevels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,\ndehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the\ntrainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance.

This PRISMA-guided scoping review\nsynthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly\ndetection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,\ngenerative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49\nstudies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to\nbrain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,\nstroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease.

Furthermore, we introduce\nlatent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate\nthe state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This\ndesign substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the\nslow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate\nthat FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment\ndetection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%\non OLS).",

    "summary": "Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent\nyears, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior\ncompression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding\ncapabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,\nincluding inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe\nerror propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these\nlimitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow\nintra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,\ndisocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error\npropagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh\nmechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,\nwhere every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform\nintra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame\ncompression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also\nbackwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an\naverage of 10.7\\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality\nper frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances.

However, when\nemploying these models to create composite sequences containing multiple\nsemantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the\ncontinuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips,\nresulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these\nchallenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the\nSemantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module\n(TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from\nadjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM\noperate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the\npre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them\nto learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from\nvariable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating\ncompositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input\nconditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding\nand succeeding motion clips.

    "summary": "Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active\ninteraction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video\nmodels, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle\nwith grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central\nhypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in\nextensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this\nhypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model\ntrained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that\nthe model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of\nplausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical\nhallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can\nbe actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where\nvision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its\nrefinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a\nco-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into\nexecutable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We\nestablish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal\nreasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\nhuman and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical\ncausality, collision dynamics, and object permanence.

Such facts, as we observed, stem\nfrom the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that\nencode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text\nprompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a\nnull-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \\textbf{NTN-Diff}, for\ntext-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across\nmasked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,\nwhile preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.\nBased on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into\nearly (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the\nmid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As\nobserved, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be\nsemantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,\nserves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise\nlow-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided\ndenoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for\nmid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve\nthe unmasked regions.

Motivated by two key\nobservations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object\nSeparation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before\npassing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS\nconsistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and\nreduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four\ncompeting methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.\nThese results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving\nmulti-object image generation.",

    "title": "Spatial Preference Rewarding for MLLMs Spatial Understanding",
    "summary": "Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial\nunderstanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object\ndescriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained\nspatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions\nor accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to\nthe user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This\nissue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs\nto model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without\ndirect supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a\nSpatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial\ncapabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object\nlocalization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image\nregions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and\nlocalization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and\nlocalization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM\ndescriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored\nrefinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct\npreference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual\ninput. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks\nshow that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with\nminimal overhead in training.

However, such\naudio-centric systems inherently exclude individuals who are deaf or hard of\nhearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer\neffective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)\nand Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.\nYet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their\nintegration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we\npropose the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations of\nsign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation. We\nfocus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic\narchitecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)\nexploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of\nlip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)\nachieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models\nspecialized for individual tasks.

    "summary": "Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and\nfine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range\nand local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing\nlocal patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited\nreceptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through\nself-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,\nMamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models\n(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla\nMamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D\nsequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus\nlacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,\nprevious methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To\novercome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba\n(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing\nlocal contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state\nfusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a\nmultiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba\nsupports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale\nweighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different\nscales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba\nby enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and\nMSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two\npublic MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,\nMSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,\nTransformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.",

    "summary": "With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content\n(AIGC) technologies, synthetic images have become increasingly prevalent in\neveryday life, posing new challenges for authenticity assessment and detection.\nDespite the effectiveness of existing methods in evaluating image authenticity\nand locating forgeries, these approaches often lack human interpretability and\ndo not fully address the growing complexity of synthetic data. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce FakeVLM, a specialized large multimodal model designed\nfor both general synthetic image and DeepFake detection tasks. FakeVLM not only\nexcels in distinguishing real from fake images but also provides clear, natural\nlanguage explanations for image artifacts, enhancing interpretability.\nAdditionally, we present FakeClue, a comprehensive dataset containing over\n100,000 images across seven categories, annotated with fine-grained artifact\nclues in natural language. FakeVLM demonstrates performance comparable to\nexpert models while eliminating the need for additional classifiers, making it\na robust solution for synthetic data detection. Extensive evaluations across\nmultiple datasets confirm the superiority of FakeVLM in both authenticity\nclassification and artifact explanation tasks, setting a new benchmark for\nsynthetic image detection.

    "title": "ForensicHub: A Unified Benchmark & Codebase for All-Domain Fake Image\n  Detection and Localization",
    "summary": "The field of Fake Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) is highly\nfragmented, encompassing four domains: deepfake detection (Deepfake), image\nmanipulation detection and localization (IMDL), artificial\nintelligence-generated image detection (AIGC), and document image manipulation\nlocalization (Doc). Although individual benchmarks exist in some domains, a\nunified benchmark for all domains in FIDL remains blank. The absence of a\nunified benchmark results in significant domain silos, where each domain\nindependently constructs its datasets, models, and evaluation protocols without\ninteroperability, preventing cross-domain comparisons and hindering the\ndevelopment of the entire FIDL field. To close the domain silo barrier, we\npropose ForensicHub, the first unified benchmark & codebase for all-domain fake\nimage detection and localization. Considering drastic variations on dataset,\nmodel, and evaluation configurations across all domains, as well as the\nscarcity of open-sourced baseline models and the lack of individual benchmarks\nin some domains, ForensicHub: i) proposes a modular and configuration-driven\narchitecture that decomposes forensic pipelines into interchangeable components\nacross datasets, transforms, models, and evaluators, allowing flexible\ncomposition across all domains; ii) fully implements 10 baseline models, 6\nbackbones, 2 new benchmarks for AIGC and Doc, and integrates 2 existing\nbenchmarks of DeepfakeBench and IMDLBenCo through an adapter-based design; iii)\nconducts indepth analysis based on the ForensicHub, offering 8 key actionable\ninsights into FIDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation\nstandards. ForensicHub represents a significant leap forward in breaking the\ndomain silos in the FIDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.",

    "summary": "Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention\nmechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due\nto the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the\nexisting cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,\nMatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative\nposition determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given\na query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is\nachieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are\niteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding\nthem into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the\nlearning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view\ndecoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.\nTo handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a\nconsistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively\nmitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing\nthe model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to\nstereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public\nMiddlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.\nMatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU\nmemory.

    "summary": "Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable\nprogress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static\nimages. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation\nincludes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties\nin maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the\ngenerated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant\nexpression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human\nface occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly\nsensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored\nchallenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving\nReward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on\nreinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing\nauxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a\ndirect and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a\nface identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our\nmethod backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling\nchain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial\nscoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature\npools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A\nKL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and\nprevent overfitting to the reward signal.

    "title": "Event Interval Modulation: A Novel Scheme for Event-based Optical Camera\n  Communication",
    "summary": "Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light\ncommunication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing\nframe-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and\nhigh processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an\nevent-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS\nenables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its\nasynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC\nsystems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse\nposition modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,\nno modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique\ncharacteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,\ncalled the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for\nevent-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating\ninformation using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a\ntheoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the\nparameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency\nresponse specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM\nis determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the\nobtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over\n10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new\nbenchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.",

    "summary": "The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious\nthreat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync\nmodifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional\ndetection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed\nphoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency\nchecks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day\ndeepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion\nmodels, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate\nnearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal\ndiscrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a\nnovel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic\nAnalysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial\nidentification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,\nlip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings.

Recent studies often use\nimage-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining\nwhether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur\nhigh computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features\npresent in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine\nerror extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes\nindeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes\nguided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization\nstrategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise\nsignal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient\npatch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise\nscore and selects the region with the highest score.

    "summary": "High-quality instance and panoptic segmentation has traditionally relied on\ndense instance-level annotations such as masks, boxes, or points, which are\ncostly, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Unsupervised and\nweakly-supervised approaches reduce this burden but remain constrained by\nsemantic backbone constraints and human bias, often producing merged or\nfragmented outputs.

These datasets are synthesized\nusing emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on\nsurrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and\nvehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations\ncorresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,\nthe synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering\nstrong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on\ntasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance\nsegmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through\nstatistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further\ndemonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on\nsynthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity\nscores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on\nreal data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing\nbenchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity.

Drawing from classic\nlocal-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel\nneural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a\nlocal-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary\nmechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply\nlearned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then\nsolve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface\nglobally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full\nfrequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining\nagnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far\nless compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --\nboth in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.\nThese qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to\nprevious intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on\nsemantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.\nFinally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn\ndeformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that\nlearn on surfaces.",

    "title": "Mitigating Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models through Image-Guided\n  Head Suppression",
    "summary": "Despite their remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks, large\nvision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from \"hallucinations\", generating\ntexts misaligned with the visual context. Existing methods aimed at reducing\nhallucinations through inference time intervention incur a significant increase\nin latency. To mitigate this, we present SPIN, a task-agnostic attention-guided\nhead suppression strategy that can be seamlessly integrated during inference,\nwithout incurring any significant compute or latency overhead. We investigate\nwhether hallucination in LVLMs can be linked to specific model components. Our\nanalysis suggests that hallucinations can be attributed to a dynamic subset of\nattention heads in each layer. Leveraging this insight, for each text query\ntoken, we selectively suppress attention heads that exhibit low attention to\nimage tokens, keeping the top-K attention heads intact. Extensive evaluations\non visual question answering and image description tasks demonstrate the\nefficacy of SPIN in reducing hallucination scores up to 2.7x while maintaining\nF1, and improving throughput by 1.8x compared to existing alternatives.

    "summary": "Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the\ninherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective\nautoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited\nto simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from\nquality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address\nthese challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video\ndiffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion\ncontrol. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,\nthen further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based\nreward model.

This study\nproposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these\nchallenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The\nmodel performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss\nfunction to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an\nensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models.\nExperimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD,\nKonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional\nperformance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman\nRank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD,\n0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing\nIQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the\ngeneralizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721\nto 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The\nablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing\nsubstantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the\nmeta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only\naddresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a\nrobust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications.

In this paper, we propose an extended\nadversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle\nnon-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation\nprocess of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean\nimage and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization.

    "summary": "Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in\ninverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.\nCurrent solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal\n(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).\nConventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or\nnegative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,\noften leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate\ndata-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are\nstatistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current\nestimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional\nconsistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise\nmatching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability\nscores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in\nreplacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with\nmodern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,\nand iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of\npriors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the\nmeasurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists\nof many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example\napplication areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC\ninstead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher\nPSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss\nreduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy\nof hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a\nstatistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional\nfidelity losses for inverse problems.",

Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend\nheavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders\nto conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic\ngain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene\nexpression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for\nGS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome\nthis limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging\nmulti-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during\ninference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial\ndata, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across\nsubpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes\nthat GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic\nmetabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to\nconventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear\npathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables\ncorrelate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being\ntrained on them.

    "summary": "To preserve privacy, multi-party computation (MPC) enables executing Machine\nLearning (ML) algorithms on secret-shared or encrypted data. However, existing\nMPC frameworks are not optimized for sparse data. This makes them unsuitable\nfor ML applications involving sparse data, e.g., recommender systems or\ngenomics. Even in plaintext, such applications involve high-dimensional sparse\ndata, that cannot be processed without sparsity-related optimizations due to\nprohibitively large memory requirements.\n  Since matrix multiplication is central in ML algorithms, we propose MPC\nalgorithms to multiply secret sparse matrices. On the one hand, our algorithms\navoid the memory issues of the \"dense\" data representation of classic secure\nmatrix multiplication algorithms. On the other hand, our algorithms can\nsignificantly reduce communication costs (some experiments show a factor 1000)\nfor realistic problem sizes. We validate our algorithms in two ML applications\nin which existing protocols are impractical.\n  An important question when developing MPC algorithms is what assumptions can\nbe made. In our case, if the number of non-zeros in a row is a sensitive piece\nof information then a short runtime may reveal that the number of non-zeros is\nsmall. Existing approaches make relatively simple assumptions, e.g., that there\nis a universal upper bound to the number of non-zeros in a row. This often\ndoesn't align with statistical reality, in a lot of sparse datasets the amount\nof data per instance satisfies a power law. We propose an approach which allows\nadopting a safe upper bound on the distribution of non-zeros in rows/columns of\nsparse matrices.",

    "summary": "Algorithms with predictions} has emerged as a powerful framework to combine\nthe robustness of traditional online algorithms with the data-driven\nperformance benefits of machine-learned (ML) predictions. However, most\nexisting approaches in this paradigm are overly conservative, {as they do not\nleverage problem structure to optimize performance in a prediction-specific\nmanner}. In this paper, we show that such prediction-specific performance\ncriteria can enable significant performance improvements over the coarser\nnotions of consistency and robustness considered in prior work. Specifically,\nwe propose a notion of \\emph{strongly-optimal} algorithms with predictions,\nwhich obtain Pareto optimality not just in the worst-case tradeoff between\nrobustness and consistency, but also in the prediction-specific tradeoff\nbetween these metrics. We develop a general bi-level optimization framework\nthat enables systematically designing strongly-optimal algorithms in a wide\nvariety of problem settings, and we propose explicit strongly-optimal\nalgorithms for several classic online problems: deterministic and randomized\nski rental, and one-max search. Our analysis reveals new structural insights\ninto how predictions can be optimally integrated into online algorithms by\nleveraging a prediction-specific design.

In this work, we introduce\na unified framework-Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks-which generalizes these\nmodels to a broader family of energy functions. Our energies are formulated as\nthe difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a\ngeneralized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other\napplies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and\nnorm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable\nsparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins,\nsparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this\nframework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation,\nallowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern.\nOur framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and\nprovides an energy minimization perspective for widely used\npost-transformations like $\\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all\nthrough suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis\nas a building block.

We present a\ngeneralized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,\nwhich standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision\nlogic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution.

The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated\nunder different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated\ncoverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under\ndifferent system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO\nvariants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.\nFinally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,\nshowing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover\nfailures and ping-pong events.

The\nshortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize\nevery possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a\nfixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We\npropose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation\nmatrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical\nstructures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented\nDST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\\% sparsity on\nImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\\times$\nand infers up to $2.9\\times$ faster.

    "summary": "Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how\nneurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied\nto machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates\nof the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such\nshortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and\ntasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian\nRepresentation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates\northogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary\nnonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation\nbackpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that\nconceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints\naccount for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental\nresults show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic\nplasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong\neffectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image\nreconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted\nfeatures. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian\nunsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,\ndemonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning\nalgorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation.

    "summary": "Supply chain attacks significantly threaten software security with malicious\ncode injections within legitimate projects. Such attacks are very rare but may\nhave a devastating impact. Detecting spurious code injections using automated\ntools is further complicated as it often requires deciphering the intention of\nboth the inserted code and its context. In this study, we propose an\nunsupervised approach for highlighting spurious code injections by quantifying\ncohesion disruptions in the source code. Using a name-prediction-based cohesion\n(NPC) metric, we analyze how function cohesion changes when malicious code is\nintroduced compared to natural cohesion fluctuations. An analysis of 54,707\nfunctions over 369 open-source C++ repositories reveals that code injection\nreduces cohesion and shifts naming patterns toward shorter, less descriptive\nnames compared to genuine function updates. Considering the sporadic nature of\nreal supply-chain attacks, we evaluate the proposed method with extreme\ntest-set imbalance and show that monitoring high-cohesion functions with NPC\ncan effectively detect functions with injected code, achieving a Precision@100\nof 36.41% at a 1:1,000 ratio and 12.47% at 1:10,000.

    "summary": "Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to\ndetect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,\ntraditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every\nquery. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy\ninputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety\nmonitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult\nto assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce\nTruncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes\nfor dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be\ntrained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can\nearly-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger\nguardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:\nby evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can \"buy\" stronger\nguardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases\nexit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated\nonly for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two\nlarge-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with\nup to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based\nprobe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than\ntheir black-box counterparts.

    "summary": "Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the\ngeneralization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the\nlandscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.\nUnfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the\ngeneralization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap\nbetween the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,\ni.e., \\textit{R\\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\\'enyi\nentropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss\nHessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \\textit{uniform}\n(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping\nthe sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the\n\\textit{R\\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of\nthe eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller\nthe (R\\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between\ngeneralization and (R\\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization\nbounds in terms of R\\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the\nreparametrization invariance property of R\\'enyi sharpness, as well as the\ntrick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.\nFurthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong\ncorrelation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\\'enyi\nsharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\\'enyi\nSharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\\'enyi Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware\nminimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our\nproposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\\%, compared against the\nclassical SAM method.",

To address this\nchallenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates\nhigh-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.\nCentral to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references\n(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level\nhardware details.

Such datasets are naturally\ndescribed as multi-resolution clusterings, i.e., not necessarily hierarchical\nsequences of partitions across scales. To analyse and compare such sequences,\nwe use tools from topological data analysis and define the Multiscale\nClustering Bifiltration (MCbiF), a 2-parameter filtration of abstract\nsimplicial complexes that encodes cluster intersection patterns across scales.\nThe MCbiF can be interpreted as a higher-order extension of Sankey diagrams and\nreduces to a dendrogram for hierarchical sequences. We show that the\nmultiparameter persistent homology (MPH) of the MCbiF yields a finitely\npresented and block decomposable module, and its stable Hilbert functions\ncharacterise the topological autocorrelation of the sequence of partitions. In\nparticular, at dimension zero, the MPH captures violations of the refinement\norder of partitions, whereas at dimension one, the MPH captures higher-order\ninconsistencies between clusters across scales. We demonstrate through\nexperiments the use of MCbiF Hilbert functions as topological feature maps for\ndownstream machine learning tasks.

The\nreader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored\nenvironment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The\nproposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to\nmaintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it\ndynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm\nidentification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance\nevaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies\nunder stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor\ncommunications and achieving low detection latency.",

To mitigate the\ndistribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a\nrobust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal\nmodel of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model\nmismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact\nand tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show\nthat the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function,\nenjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with\nthe state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo\nbenchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby\nrequiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the\nreproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing\nthe proposed algorithms and the experiments.",

    "summary": "Making the control of building heating systems more energy efficient is\ncrucial for reducing global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.\nTraditional rule-based control methods use a static, outdoor\ntemperature-dependent heating curve to regulate heat input. This open-loop\napproach fails to account for both the current state of the system (indoor\ntemperature) and free heat gains, such as solar radiation, often resulting in\npoor thermal comfort and overheating. Model Predictive Control (MPC) addresses\nthese drawbacks by using predictive modeling to optimize heating based on a\nbuilding's learned thermal behavior, current system state, and weather\nforecasts. However, current industrial MPC solutions often employ simplified\nphysics-inspired indoor temperature models, sacrificing accuracy for robustness\nand interpretability. While purely data-driven models offer superior predictive\nperformance and therefore more accurate control, they face challenges such as a\nlack of transparency.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a partially stochastic deep learning (DL)\narchitecture, dubbed LSTM+BNN, for building-specific indoor temperature\nmodeling. Unlike most studies that evaluate model performance through\nsimulations or limited test buildings, our experiments across a comprehensive\ndataset of 100 real-world buildings, under various weather conditions,\ndemonstrate that LSTM+BNN outperforms an industry-proven reference model,\nreducing the average prediction error measured as RMSE by more than 40% for the\n48-hour prediction horizon of interest.

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are\na standard method of estimating the privacy risk of these systems. The risk of\nindividual records is typically computed by evaluating MIAs in a\nrecord-specific privacy game. We analyze the record-specific privacy game\ncommonly used for evaluating attackers under realistic assumptions (the\n\\textit{traditional} game) -- particularly for synthetic tabular data -- and\nshow that it averages a record's privacy risk across datasets. We show this\nimplicitly assumes the dataset a record is part of has no impact on the\nrecord's risk, providing a misleading risk estimate when a specific model or\nsynthetic dataset is released. Instead, we propose a novel use of the\nleave-one-out game, used in existing work exclusively to audit differential\nprivacy guarantees, and call this the \\textit{model-seeded} game. We formalize\nit and show that it provides an accurate estimate of the privacy risk posed by\na given adversary for a record in its specific dataset. We instantiate and\nevaluate the state-of-the-art MIA for synthetic data generators in the\ntraditional and model-seeded privacy games, and show across multiple datasets\nand models that the two privacy games indeed result in different risk scores,\nwith up to 94\\% of high-risk records being overlooked by the traditional game.\nWe further show that records in smaller datasets and models not protected by\nstrong differential privacy guarantees tend to have a larger gap between risk\nestimates. Taken together, our results show that the model-seeded setup yields\na risk estimate specific to a certain model or synthetic dataset released and\nin line with the standard notion of privacy leakage from prior work,\nmeaningfully different from the dataset-averaged risk provided by the\ntraditional privacy game.",

Although existing graph OOD detection methods\nleverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their\nperformance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic\nshifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework\nthat integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph\nclassification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information\nBottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and\nirrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled\nredundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are\nproposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection.

    "summary": "Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of\nlarge language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have\nbeen introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the\nsoftware frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across\nhardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven\nvariants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows\nthat existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable\nlanguage model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the\noutliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive\nextension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.\nMX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its\nexponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the\nexponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier\nelement. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model\nperformance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage\noverhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6\nfor efficient LLM inference.",

    "summary": "Inference and prediction under partial knowledge of a physical system is\nchallenging, particularly when multiple confounding sources influence the\nmeasured response. Explicitly accounting for these influences in physics-based\nmodels is often infeasible due to epistemic uncertainty, cost, or time\nconstraints, resulting in models that fail to accurately describe the behavior\nof the system. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning models such as\nvariational autoencoders are not guaranteed to identify a parsimonious\nrepresentation. As a result, they can suffer from poor generalization\nperformance and reconstruction accuracy in the regime of limited and noisy\ndata. We propose a physics-informed variational autoencoder architecture that\ncombines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of\ndata-driven models. To promote disentanglement of the known physics and\nconfounding influences, the latent space is partitioned into physically\nmeaningful variables that parametrize a physics-based model, and data-driven\nvariables that capture variability in the domain and class of the physical\nsystem. The encoder is coupled with a decoder that integrates physics-based and\ndata-driven components, and constrained by an adversarial training objective\nthat prevents the data-driven components from overriding the known physics,\nensuring that the physics-grounded latent variables remain interpretable. We\ndemonstrate that the model is able to disentangle features of the input signal\nand separate the known physics from confounding influences using supervision in\nthe form of class and domain observables. The model is evaluated on a series of\nsynthetic case studies relevant to engineering structures, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of the proposed approach.",

We apply this\nframework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear\nstructure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train\nmodel, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable\nsystems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the\nsymmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,\nrendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method.

    "summary": "Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of\nPatching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to\neffectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space\nbeneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching\npartitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed\nrepresentation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful\nrepresentations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a\nselective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches\nfor forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space\n(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic\nReassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the\ncontextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of\ncontextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based\nmodels. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet\neffective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.\nFurthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the\nperformance of existing patch-based models.

    "summary": "This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness\nand efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing\nvulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible\nenvironments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an\nempirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and\na selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a\nselective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly\nlower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined\nthreshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather\nthan progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids\ncatastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted\nrollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the\nCliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8\npercent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi\nv3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9\npercent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while\nalso sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies\nconfirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these\nsafety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable\nsequential decision making.",

As a result, the\noutput of an infinitely wide network with at least one LN remains bounded, even\non inputs far from the training data.

Yet, their practical\nbenefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and\nNVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and\nreal-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods\nstruggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably\nneutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two\nscale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the\nclassic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to\nFP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and\nformat-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of\nhigh-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible\noverhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of\nthe activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and\n2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on\nRTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches\nor outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the\npoint where it can near the accuracy that of NVFP4.

To address these issues, we\nintroduce Merge-And-GuidE (MAGE), a two-stage framework that leverages model\nmerging for guided decoding. We first identify a critical compatibility problem\nbetween the guidance and base models. In Stage 1, MAGE resolves this by\ndynamically constructing a more robust base model, merging a series of backbone\nmodels that account for multiple objectives. In Stage 2, we merge explicit and\nimplicit value models into a unified guidance proxy, which then steers the\ndecoding of the base model from Stage 1. Our analysis empirically validates\nLinear Mode Connectivity (LMC) in value models, explores the relationship\nbetween model merging and prediction ensembling, and demonstrates the enhanced\ncontrollability afforded by our approach.

    "summary": "Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires\nprecise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models\n(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in\nnatural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these\nmodifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like\nSMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by\ntranslating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular\noptimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable\nediting intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating\nthose intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our\napproach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits\nderived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On\ndownstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and\ntarget activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage\npoints to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines\nwhile preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,\nMECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,\nlaying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative\nhuman-AI workflows in drug discovery.",

    "summary": "The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the\nvariations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used\nto predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated\nuncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological\nstructures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.\nThis study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of\ndeep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce\nfluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model\nthat mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments\nfrom the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly\ntransferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the\ngenerated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits\nwithout mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a\nprocess-based model to generate those training data allows us to include\nvaluable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the\ndeposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by\nchecking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a\nseries of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given\ncredit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological\nstructures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and\nmultimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models\ncan leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of\npromise.",

Although existing methods resort to language\nmodels to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard\nthe unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To\naddress the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from\nstructural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super\nnodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains.\nSpecifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class\nlabels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph\ninstance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect\nsuper nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new\nstructure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying\ncross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel\npre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more\nexpressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to\ndifferent domains and downstream tasks.

    "summary": "Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say\ndrug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their\neffects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of\ninteraction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to\nanother target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed\nassignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables\nbetter decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug\ndoses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly\ndone from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on\nthe entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,\nwe introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call\ninteraction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine\nlearning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the\npopularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of\ncorrectly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show\nthe invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.\nSecondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding\ndrug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when\neither drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical\napplications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate\nside information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical\nevaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various\nstate-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how\ndifferent types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of\nIC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.",

This\npaper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation\nlearning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on\naudio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after\nextensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit\nsystematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis\ndemonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in\nfeature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization\ndynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the\nfusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker\nmodalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that\nfuture multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight\nallocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced\naccording to the capabilities of each modality.",

Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking\nHarmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling\n(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.\nOur second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or\nfirst-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal\nfor resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \\times$\nless energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while\nretaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we\npropose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical\nsystem using parallel scans.

We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three\ncriteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this\nsetting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48\npluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German\nand English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other\ncommon datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better\nreflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a\ntraditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and\nfind that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.\nMotivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a\n\"check all documents individually, filter cheaply\" approach: it (i) decomposes\nqueries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter\nto discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that\nPluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base\nLLM.

    "summary": "Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world\nsettings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the\nActively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only\nselects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.\nThe measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative\ndelayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may\nprovably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy\ndespite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable\nMDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate\nthe belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to\njointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and\nunobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital\nhealth application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital\ninterventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.",

    "summary": "Modern foundation models often undergo iterative ``bootstrapping'' in their\npost-training phase: a model generates synthetic data, an external verifier\nfilters out low-quality samples, and the high-quality subset is used for\nfurther fine-tuning. Over multiple iterations, the model performance improves,\nraising a crucial question: How should the total budget for generation and\ntraining be allocated across iterations to maximize final performance? In this\nwork, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing budget allocation\nstrategies. Specifically, we show that constant policies fail to converge with\nhigh probability, while increasing policies -- particularly exponential growth\npolicies -- exhibit significant theoretical advantages. Experiments on image\ndenoising with diffusion probabilistic models and math reasoning with large\nlanguage models show that both exponential and polynomial growth policies\nconsistently outperform constant policies, with exponential policies often\nproviding more stable performance.",

    "summary": "Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of\ntime-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of\na recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only\nthe output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in\nEdge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series\nanomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can\nlead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection\nperformance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on\nresource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention\nmechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial\ncomputation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to\nimprove the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning\nefficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the\nspectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism\n- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and\nlogistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across\nbenchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR\nmethod, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC\nsuggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series\nanomaly detection.",

Theoretically, we derive a variational\nlower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective\nenhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP-AG\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across simulation benchmarks\nand real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP-AG offers a\npromising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy\nlearning.",

While end-to-end\nvision-based methods promise broader applicability, no system to date\nsimultaneously achieves full sim-to-real transfer, onboard execution, and\nchampion-level performance. In this work, we present SkyDreamer, to the best of\nour knowledge, the first end-to-end vision-based ADR policy that maps directly\nfrom pixel-level representations to motor commands. SkyDreamer builds on\ninformed Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach where the world\nmodel decodes to privileged information only available during training. By\nextending this concept to end-to-end vision-based ADR, the world model\neffectively functions as an implicit state and parameter estimator, greatly\nimproving interpretability. SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid,\nresolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from\nthe world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration,\nenabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining.\nReal-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight,\nexecuting tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder,\nreaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further\ndemonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on\npoor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion\nby accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its\nflight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to\nimportant aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving\nextremely high-speed, agile flight.",

Diffusion models,\nknown for their capability to learn complex, high-dimensional and multi-modal\ndata distributions, provide a promising alternative when applied to motion\nplanning problems and have already shown interesting results. However, most of\nthe current approaches train their model for a single environment, limiting\ntheir generalization to environments not seen during training.

    "title": "A Generalized Placeability Metric for Model-Free Unified Pick-and-Place\n  Reasoning",
    "summary": "To reliably pick and place unknown objects under real-world sensing noise\nremains a challenging task, as existing methods rely on strong object priors\n(e.g., CAD models), or planar-support assumptions, limiting generalization and\nunified reasoning between grasping and placing. In this work, we introduce a\ngeneralized placeability metric that evaluates placement poses directly from\nnoisy point clouds, without any shape priors. The metric jointly scores\nstability, graspability, and clearance. From raw geometry, we extract the\nsupport surfaces of the object to generate diverse candidates for\nmulti-orientation placement and sample contacts that satisfy collision and\nstability constraints. By conditioning grasp scores on each candidate\nplacement, our proposed method enables model-free unified pick-and-place\nreasoning and selects grasp-place pairs that lead to stable, collision-free\nplacements. On unseen real objects and non-planar object supports, our metric\ndelivers CAD-comparable accuracy in predicting stability loss and generally\nproduces more physically plausible placements than learning-based predictors.",

    "summary": "This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated\nhuman-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication\nunder network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported\nby numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and\ndelay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees\nstability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is\ncharacterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The\ncriteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters,\nwhere increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear\nmanner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be\ngeneralised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design\nguidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing\nhuman-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and\nmotor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for\neffective delay-compensation strategies.",

Despite their potential, conventional 3D indoor scene graphs\nface critical limitations, particularly under- and over-segmentation of room\nlayers in structurally complex environments. Under-segmentation misclassifies\nnon-traversable areas as part of a room, often in open spaces, while\nover-segmentation fragments a single room into overlapping segments in complex\nenvironments. These issues stem from naive voxel-based map representations that\nrely solely on geometric proximity, disregarding the structural constraints of\ntraversable spaces and resulting in inconsistent room layers within scene\ngraphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle\nsegmentation inconsistency as a challenge and address it with\nTraversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs (TACS-Graphs), a novel framework\nthat integrates ground robot traversability with room segmentation. By\nleveraging traversability as a key factor in defining room boundaries, the\nproposed method achieves a more semantically meaningful and topologically\ncoherent segmentation, effectively mitigating the inaccuracies of voxel-based\nscene graph approaches in complex environments. Furthermore, the enhanced\nsegmentation consistency improves loop closure detection efficiency in the\nproposed Consistent Scene Graph-leveraging Loop Closure Detection (CoSG-LCD)\nleading to higher pose estimation accuracy.

Game-theoretic models presume that each agent\nwishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions.\nThese games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, specifying how far into\nthe future each agent plans. In practical settings, however, decision-makers\nmay vary in foresightedness, or how much they care about their current cost in\nrelation to their past and future costs. We conjecture that quantifying and\nestimating each agent's foresightedness from online data will enable safer and\nmore efficient interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this\ninference problem as an inverse dynamic game. We consider a specific objective\nfunction parametrization that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted\nplanning. Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed\ncomplementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of\nsolutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters to solve\nfor agents' foresightedness. We conduct three experiments: one with\nsynthetically generated delivery robot motion, one with real-world data\ninvolving people walking, biking, and driving vehicles, and one using\nhigh-fidelity simulators. The results of these experiments demonstrate that\nexplicitly inferring agents' foresightedness enables game-theoretic models to\nmake 33% more accurate models for agents' behavior.",

    "summary": "We present the design, development, and experimental validation of BlueME, a\ncompact magnetoelectric (ME) antenna array system for underwater robot-to-robot\ncommunication. BlueME employs ME antennas operating at their natural mechanical\nresonance frequency to efficiently transmit and receive very-low-frequency\n(VLF) electromagnetic signals underwater. We outline the design, simulation,\nfabrication, and integration of the proposed system on low-power embedded\nplatforms, focusing on portable and scalable applications. For performance\nevaluation, we deployed BlueME on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a\nremotely operated vehicle (ROV) in open-water field trials. Ocean trials\ndemonstrate that BlueME maintains reliable signal transmission at distances\nbeyond 700 meters while consuming only 10 watts of power. Field trials show\nthat the system operates effectively in challenging underwater conditions such\nas turbidity, obstacles, and multipath interference -- conditions that\ngenerally affect acoustics and optics. Our analysis also examines the impact of\ncomplete submersion on system performance and identifies key deployment\nconsiderations. This work represents the first practical underwater deployment\nof ME antennas outside the laboratory and implements the largest VLF ME array\nsystem to date. BlueME demonstrates significant potential for marine robotics\nand automation in multi-robot cooperative systems and remote sensor networks.",

However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations\nsuch as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving\ncalibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only\npolicies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to\ninfer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot\nmanipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch\ngeneration in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on\nhigh-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment\non visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an\nencoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth\nimages, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image\nsequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile\ndata with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile\nobservations.

    "summary": "Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical\ndeployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address\nmulti-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned\nfrom limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural\nnetwork-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that\nparadoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper\nintroduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly\ncouples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization.\nSpecifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it\ntransforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty\nsets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal\ncalibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii)\nit reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization\nproblem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments.\nExtensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation\ntasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in\ngeneralization to unseen environments.

This can present a number of challenges\nincluding linguistic barriers (Ullah et al., 2021), cultural differences in\nlearning style (Omidvar & Tan, 2012), cultural sensitivity in course design\n(Nguyen, 2022) and perceived isolation when students feel their perspectives or\nexperiences are not reflected or valued in the learning environment\n(Hansen-Brown et al., 2022).

In addition, Generative AI\n(GAI), such as, Large Language Models (LLMs) can amplify the potential for\nthese culturally aware AI agents to address educational challenges due to their\nadvanced capacity for understanding and generating contextually relevant\ncontent (Wang et al., 2024).

    "title": "A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems",
    "summary": "Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control\nloops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source\nautonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control\nnodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant\n(de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available\ntime budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport\ndesigned for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data\nin native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double\nbuffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into\nROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM\noperates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness\nand minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence\nnumbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering,\nliveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces\ndata-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such\nas FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows\n95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a\nproduction-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased\nlocalization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all\nlatency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from\n521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h)\non dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).",

While\ndeterministic actions can be crafted by sampling or optimizing with certain\nconstraints, planning actions with uncertainty, i.e., probabilistic actions,\nremains a challenge for TAMP. On the contrary, Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nexcels in acquiring versatile, yet short-horizon, manipulation skills that are\nrobust with uncertainties. In this letter, we design a method that integrates\nRL skills into TAMP pipelines. Besides the policy, a RL skill is defined with\ndata-driven logical components that enable the skill to be deployed by symbolic\nplanning. A plan refinement sub-routine is designed to further tackle the\ninevitable effect uncertainties. In the experiments, we compare our method with\nbaseline hierarchical planning from both TAMP and RL fields and illustrate the\nstrength of the method.

    "summary": "This paper introduces a method for designing spatially intelligent robot\nswarm behaviors to localize concealed radio emitters. We use differential\nevolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals\nindependently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic\nsurveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information\ngain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We\nsimulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning\npre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing\ncapability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed\nwithin the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and\nfrequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are\ndriven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with\nfailures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of\nthe map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their\nhigher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75%\ncompared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from\n1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional\nsensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges.\nThese results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic\nphenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the\nenvironment. Consequently, spatial intelligence, realized here through\noptimized patrol routes and antenna selection, is a critical design\nconsideration for effective robotic surveillance.",

    "summary": "Objective: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) has become the\ngold standard for a variety of surgical procedures, but the optimal method of\ntraining surgeons for RMIS is unknown. We hypothesized that real-time, rather\nthan post-task, error feedback would better increase learning speed and reduce\nerrors. Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the\nring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the\nimpact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three\ngroups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and\n(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on\nthe accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task. Participants who\nreceived real-time feedback outperformed other groups in ring orientation.\nAdditionally, participants who received feedback in replay outperformed\nparticipants who did not receive any error feedback on ring orientation during\nlong, straight path sections. There were no significant differences between\ngroups for ring position overall, but participants who received real-time\nfeedback outperformed the other groups in positional accuracy on tightly curved\npath sections. Conclusion: The addition of real-time haptic and visual error\nfeedback improves learning outcomes in a virtual surgical task over error\nfeedback in replay or no error feedback at all. Significance: This work\ndemonstrates that multi-sensory error feedback delivered in real time leads to\nbetter training outcomes as compared to the same feedback delivered after task\ncompletion. This novel method of training may enable surgical trainees to\ndevelop skills with greater speed and accuracy.",

During the inference phase the denoising\nprocess refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions.
