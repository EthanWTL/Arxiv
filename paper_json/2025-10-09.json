    "title": "BLAZER: Bootstrapping LLM-based Manipulation Agents with Zero-Shot Data\n  Generation",
    "summary": "Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress\nof computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in\nrobotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop\nmore generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,\nrobotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic\ntasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically\nsuffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this\nproblem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies\nfrom automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot\ncapabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for\ndiverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to\nfinetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human\nsupervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's\nstate, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based\nmanipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly\nimprove zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.\nMoreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables\ndownscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on\nthe project page.",

    "summary": "Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central\ngoal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on\nfine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.\nWe present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task\ndescription into an actionable plan for a target robot without any\ndemonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a\nvideo generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using\noff-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative\nposes for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals\nand trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a\ntracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics\nmodel. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow\nnaturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and\ndeformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot\nquadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without\ndemonstrations or embodiment-specific training.

    "summary": "Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models\nand guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining\ncorpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather\nthan demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts\ncross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,\na model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test\ncases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse\npool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each\ntest case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original\nobjective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and\naggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose\nshared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations\nthat steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply\nArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains\nand show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new\nfailure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,\nand improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to\ncontinuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation\nmodels.",

    "summary": "How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing\nprior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while\nmonitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model\nfamilies. We observe that apparent \"forgetting\" on held-out tasks after narrow\nfine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a\nmeasurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple\ncounting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we\nidentify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting\ndrift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)\nupdating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models\nand tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving\nheld-out performance. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/jessemelpolio/LMM_CL",

    "summary": "A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own\nexperience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.\nHowever, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning\nremains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards\n(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn\ntool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight\ndiverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently\nimprove effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value\nof early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our\nresults provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong\nfoundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical\nbridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.",

    "summary": "To perform few-shot learning, language models extract signals from a few\ninput-label pairs, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule, and apply\nthis rule to new inputs. How is this implemented in the forward pass of modern\ntransformer models? To explore this question, we study a structured family of\nfew-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer\n$k$ to the input. We introduce a novel optimization method that localizes the\nmodel's few-shot ability to only a few attention heads. We then perform an\nin-depth analysis of individual heads, via dimensionality reduction and\ndecomposition. As an example, on Llama-3-8B-instruct, we reduce its mechanism\non our tasks to just three attention heads with six-dimensional subspaces,\nwhere four dimensions track the unit digit with trigonometric functions at\nperiods $2$, $5$, and $10$, and two dimensions track magnitude with\nlow-frequency components. To deepen our understanding of the mechanism, we also\nderive a mathematical identity relating ``aggregation'' and ``extraction''\nsubspaces for attention heads, allowing us to track the flow of information\nfrom individual examples to a final aggregated concept. Using this, we identify\na self-correction mechanism where mistakes learned from earlier demonstrations\nare suppressed by later demonstrations.

Existing\napproaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack\neffective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory\nincorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only\nenvironmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that\nencode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs\nimagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model\nimagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant\nenvironmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)\na language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual\npurposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)\nHybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral\npatterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an\nexperience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge\nthrough specialized encoders.

In this paper, we investigate whether BFS\ncan achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We\npresent BFS-Prover, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key\ninnovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert\niteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to\nfocus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs\nautomatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM's policy\nto prioritize productive expansions. Third, we employ length normalization in\nBFS to encourage exploration of deeper proof paths. BFS-Prover achieves a\nstate-of-the-art score of $72.95\\%$ on the MiniF2F test set and therefore\nchallenges the perceived necessity of complex tree search methods,\ndemonstrating that BFS can achieve competitive performance when properly\nscaled.

Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size\nthreshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning\nconverges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts\nhow the critical step size must scale with response length and the success\nrate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization\nimprove stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success\nrate can stagnate strictly below $100\\%$.

    "summary": "Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to\nmanipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text\ninstructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce\nKontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new\ndimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits\ngradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous\nmanner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to\naccept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with\nthe edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To\ninject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that\nmaps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's\nmodulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of\nimage-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,\nfollowed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous\nKontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength\nfor instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations\nsuch as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,\nwithout requiring attribute-specific training.",

    "summary": "Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance\ndespite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical\ngap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without\nestablishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To\naddress this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building\nspatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a\nmultimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,\nsingle image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed\nthrough a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across\nmodalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive\ntraining framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object\nlocalization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional\nspatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning\nwith verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter\nmodel that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning\nbenchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing\nGPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%.

    "summary": "Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model\n(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.\nRecent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning\n(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense\nexternal reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs\nthemselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution\nmechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve\nthrough mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce\nCo-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents\nto improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without\nexternal supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion\ndynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and\noptimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and\nscalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently\noutperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nmost evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of\ninteraction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number\nand diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and\neffective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.",

    "summary": "Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant\ninformation over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a\ntask. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to\neffectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information\nand make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when\nacting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two\ndomains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both\ndomains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and\ntask success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.",

    "summary": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem\nproving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by\nchallenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and\ninference-time compute. This paper introduces \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system\ndesigned to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary\ninnovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for\ncontinually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This\nframework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage\nexpert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and\nperiodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail\nlong-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced\nmulti-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference\ntime. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level\nplanner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler\nsubgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,\nenabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by\nleveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to\nscaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics\nbenchmarks. \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\\% and 41.4\\% on the MiniF2F\nand ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal\nmathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of\nbroader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon\nmulti-turn reasoning and complex search.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general\nprogramming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios\nsuch as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends\nheavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply\ngenerating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack\nfine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or\ntree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical\nlinks. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share\ninformation across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space\ndiversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based\ncoding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior\nguidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS\nretains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure\ninto the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical\ntrajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and\ncollaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design\nimproves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench\nshows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous\ndimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under\na 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime).

    "summary": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful\narchitectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and\ntextual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a\nVision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual\ncontent into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end\n-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to\nperform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the\ncognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which\nvisual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and\nhow effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most\nexisting works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens\nreceiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus\nto the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from\nViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely\nstudied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these\nViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the\nLLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their\nimportance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM\narchitectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and\nquantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also\npropose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how\nthis information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly\nutilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range\nof LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT\nattention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.",

However, currently available open-source dLLMs\noften generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at\nevery denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present\nSpiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by\n$\\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output\ndistribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying\nideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes\ndraft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an\nauto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and\neliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To\nstructure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph\nwhich is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise\nnature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To\nfurther optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an\nefficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines\nhigh-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling\nincreased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup\nachieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent\ninnovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and\nmulti-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel\ndecoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of\nthese methods leading to total speedups of up to $\\mathbf{7.9\\times}$.",

    "title": "DeepPrune: Parallel Scaling without Inter-trace Redundancy",
    "summary": "Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning\ncapabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces\nsignificant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our\nanalysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical\nfinal answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this\ncritical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that\nenables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features\na specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques\nto accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which\nrealizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy\nclustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving\nanswer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks\n(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that\nDeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to\nconventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive\naccuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for\nefficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.\nOur code and data are here: https://deepprune.github.io/",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm\nfor enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,\nprevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy\nteacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may\nintroduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting\nreasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher\nstrategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance\nPolicy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages\nguidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy\nmodel fails to generate correct solutions. This \"guidance-on-demand\" approach\nexpands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,\nAMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the\nstudent to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,\nthus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive\nexperiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with\na 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on\nout-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and\nenabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our\nmethod achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more\npowerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate\na more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO.",

This forces agents to waste exploration and computational\nresources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable\nlearning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce\nGaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal\nattention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the\nagent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that\nreturn differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations\nproduce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely\ntask-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized\nthrough return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to\ndistinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group\nsimilar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their\nreturn differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive\ntriplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention\nmechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with\ndifferent outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample\nefficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated\nacross a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without\nmodifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.",

    "summary": "Causal reasoning is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nunderstand genuine cause-and-effect relationships beyond pattern matching.\nExisting benchmarks suffer from critical limitations such as reliance on\nsynthetic data and narrow domain coverage. We introduce a novel benchmark\nconstructed from casually identified relationships extracted from top-tier\neconomics and finance journals, drawing on rigorous methodologies including\ninstrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity\ndesigns. Our benchmark comprises 40,379 evaluation items covering five task\ntypes across domains such as health, environment, technology, law, and culture.\nExperimental results on eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial\nlimitations, with the best model achieving only 57.6\\% accuracy. Moreover,\nmodel scale does not consistently translate to superior performance, and even\nadvanced reasoning models struggle with fundamental causal relationship\nidentification. These findings underscore a critical gap between current LLM\ncapabilities and demands of reliable causal reasoning in high-stakes\napplications.",

    "summary": "The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language\nmodels (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require\nintelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing\ngrounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit\nvery challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous\ncapacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets\nhas led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the\nstructure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these\nenvironments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This\npaper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief\nstates of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This\nfoundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of\n\\emph{possibility} and \\emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal\nlogic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make\ninfere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for\nproper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively\nguide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from\nreaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity\nsimulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses\ncomplex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs\nwith the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world\nmodel and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable\nautonomous agents.",

    "summary": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces\nsignificant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel\nmethods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy\nand complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal\nframework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular\n(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in\ncontrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering\n(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)\nanalysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature\nfusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This\nfeature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\narchitecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at\nlow SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).\nAdditionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous\nmulti-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%\nclassification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training\ntimes (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this\nframework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational\nefficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.\nThis work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG\nartifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion\nsurpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.",

    "summary": "Automated planning using a symbolic planning language, such as PDDL, is a\ngeneral approach to producing optimal plans to achieve a stated goal. However,\ncreating suitable machine understandable descriptions of the planning domain,\nproblem, and goal requires expertise in the planning language, limiting the\nutility of these tools for non-expert humans. Recent efforts have explored\nutilizing a symbolic planner in conjunction with a large language model to\ngenerate plans from natural language descriptions given by a non-expert human\n(LLM+PDDL). Our approach performs initial translation of goal specifications to\na set of PDDL goal constraints using an LLM; such translations often result in\nimprecise symbolic specifications, which are difficult to validate directly. We\naccount for this using an evolutionary approach to generate a population of\nsymbolic goal specifications with slight differences from the initial\ntranslation, and utilize a trained LSTM-based validation model to assess\nwhether each induced plan in the population adheres to the natural language\nspecifications. We evaluate our approach on a collection of prototypical\nspecifications in a notional naval disaster recovery task, and demonstrate that\nour evolutionary approach improve adherence of generated plans to natural\nlanguage specifications when compared to plans generated using only LLM\ntranslations.

Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based\nLoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task\ninstruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain\nineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.\nInspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit\nMoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the\nup-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing\nand down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces\nthe traditional dense trainable version.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise\nAPIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user\nintent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce\nDiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a\ndisambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes\npersona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish\namong highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source\nmodels with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates\nreal-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live\nagentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional\nstatic metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE\nraise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over\nClaude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we\nrelease an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications\npaired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a\npractical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling\nagents.",

    "summary": "Existing interpretability methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fall\nshort by focusing on linear directions or isolated features, overlooking the\nhigh-dimensional, nonlinear, and relational geometry within model\nrepresentations. This study focuses on how adversarial inputs systematically\naffect the internal representation spaces of LLMs, a topic which remains poorly\nunderstood. We propose persistent homology (PH), a tool from topological data\nanalysis, as a principled framework to characterize the multi-scale dynamics\nwithin LLM activations. Using PH, we systematically analyze six\nstate-of-the-art models under two distinct adversarial conditions, indirect\nprompt injection and backdoor fine-tuning, and identify a consistent\ntopological signature of adversarial influence. Across architectures and model\nsizes, adversarial inputs induce ``topological compression'', where the latent\nspace becomes structurally simpler, collapsing from varied, compact,\nsmall-scale features into fewer, dominant, and more dispersed large-scale ones.\nThis topological signature is statistically robust across layers, highly\ndiscriminative, and provides interpretable insights into how adversarial\neffects emerge and propagate. By quantifying the shape of activations and\nneuronal information flow, our architecture-agnostic framework reveals\nfundamental invariants of representational change, offering a complementary\nperspective to existing interpretability methods.",

To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal\ndataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot\nconversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models\ndesigned to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic\nhuman-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement\nfeatures. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot\nerrors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for\na mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are\ninvited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these\nfailures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various\nperformance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate.

    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,\ndemonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual\nand textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a\npromising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected\ncorner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a\nmodel must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical\nobjects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require\nsystems that are not \"shortsighted\", i.e., systems with strong perception\ncapabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With\nthis in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question\nAnswering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused\nsolely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance\nannotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that\nmodel performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated\ndriving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,\nour study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the\nsimplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared\nto humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%\nhuman performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size\nwas relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify\nspecific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain\nparticularly challenging for these models.",

Our main\ntheoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on\nembedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.\nSecond, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at\nlengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with\nreduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:\nas more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding\nseparation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a\nsecond obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We\nhypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving\nAverage (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random\nhyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both\nmechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random\nOthello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this\nmore complex setting.",

To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of\nproblems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling\nbudgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models\noutperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms\nthem when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been\ninterpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We\nargue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric\noutputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success\nin the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can\ntherefore be misleading.

    "summary": "Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)\nsignals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy,\nand non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional\nAwareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG)\nframework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the\nEEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that\nsimultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.\nTo mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype\nContrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes\nto improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct\ncomprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the\nThings-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms\nprior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the\ntransformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive\nobjectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more\ngeneralizable and robust neural representations.",

    "summary": "Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in\nreasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains\nof thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of\nreflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five\nmathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has\nalready produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its\noutput. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory\nand rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models\nand datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.\nWe observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps\nprimarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct\ninitially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a\nquestion-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token\nefficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate\nanswers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated\nby this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a\ncandidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens\nby 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.",

Despite achieving high-quality\nresults for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data\nthat contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,\ne.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In\nthis paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for\nrobustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent\nappearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to\nlearn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,\nenabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.\nWhile capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,\nwe generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead.

Our contributions include a\nnovel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint\noptimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel\nneural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on\nchallenging real-world data.

However, integrating AI into smart\nglasses featuring a small form factor and limited battery capacity remains\nchallenging for a satisfactory user experience. To this end, this paper\nproposes the design of a smart glasses platform for always-on on-device object\ndetection with an all-day battery lifetime. The proposed platform is based on\nGAP9, a novel multi-core RISC-V processor from Greenwaves Technologies.\nAdditionally, a family of sub-million parameter TinyissimoYOLO networks are\nproposed. They are benchmarked on established datasets, capable of\ndifferentiating up to 80 classes on MS-COCO. Evaluations on the smart glasses\nprototype demonstrate TinyissimoYOLO's inference latency of only 17ms and\nconsuming 1.59mJ energy per inference. An end-to-end latency of 56ms is\nachieved which is equivalent to 18 frames per seconds (FPS) with a total power\nconsumption of 62.9mW. This ensures continuous system runtime of up to 9.3\nhours on a 154mAh battery.

Until now, finetuning has\nbeen regarded as a controlled and secure process in which training on benign\ndatasets leads to predictable behaviors. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the\nfirst time, that an adversary can create compromised LLMs that are performant\nand benign, yet exhibit adversarial behaviors once finetuned by downstream\nusers. To this end, we propose an attack, FAB (Finetuning-activated Adversarial\nBehaviors), which compromises an LLM via meta-learning techniques that simulate\ndownstream finetuning, explicitly optimizing for the emergence of adversarial\nbehaviors in the finetuned models. At the same time, the compromised LLM is\nregularized to retain general capabilities and to exhibit no adversarial\nbehaviors prior to finetuning. As a result, when users finetune (e.g.,\ninstruction-tuning, distillation, DPO) the seemingly benign model on their own\ndatasets, they unknowingly trigger its dormant adversarial behavior. We\nexperimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB across multiple LLMs and\nthree commonly considered target behaviors: unsolicited advertising,\njailbreakability, and over-refusal. We show that FAB-triggers are robust to\nvarious finetuning choices made by the user (e.g., dataset, number of steps,\nscheduler, post-training algorithm).

HAI focuses on the interaction\nlayer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and\nagents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This\nensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As\nthe core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down\ncommunication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service\ndiscovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless\ninterconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,\noperates at the cognitive layer.

    "title": "Mix- and MoE-DPO: A Variational Inference Approach to Direct Preference\n  Optimization",
    "summary": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and\neffective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for\naligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing\nDPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their\nexpressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or\ndiverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a\nframework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts\n(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our\nmethod introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes\na variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient\nlearning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO\nprovides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via\nuniversal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy\nspecialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;\nand (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables\nuser-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base\narchitectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert\nmodels, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and\nspecialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and\nmulti-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a\npowerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous\nagents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent\ninteractions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic\nbehavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like\nreinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence\nthe behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the\nfirst investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS\nalgorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order\nderivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural\ncomponents that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce\nShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based\nagents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'\nlearning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate\nthat LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria\nin competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and\nChicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative\ngames (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).\nOur findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through\ninteraction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent\nLLM research.",

Our findings show\nthat training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on\nthe language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks.

    "summary": "The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world\napplications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this\nwork, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents\nthrough backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to\nsingle-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a\nmulti-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri\nrelies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and\nsubsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step\nmanipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental\nresults show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while\nmaintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling\nthe stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri\nparadoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even\nimproves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate\nCoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to\nmultimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step\ncontrol within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task\ncapabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises\npotential safty risks.",

Given their grow- ing societal\ninfluence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political\ndomain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic\nprocesses. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propa- gation\nacross eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test\n(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the in- herent political\nleanings of these models. Sub- sequently, persona prompting with the PCT is\nused to explore explicit stereotypes across vari- ous social dimensions. In a\nfinal step, implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating mod- els with\nmultilingual versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning\npolit- ical alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the\nnature and extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit\nstereotypes elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those\niden- tified via explicit persona prompting. Interest- ingly, for most models,\nimplicit and explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggest- ing a\ndegree of transparency or \"awareness\" regarding their inherent biases.

Using small poisoned\nbudgets that pair dialectal prompts -- principally African American Vernacular\nEnglish (AAVE) and a Southern dialect -- with toxic or stereotyped completions\nduring instruction tuning, this work probes whether linguistic style can act as\na latent trigger for harmful behavior. Across multiple model families and\nscales, poisoned exposure elevates toxicity and stereotype expression for\ndialectal inputs -- most consistently for AAVE -- while Standard American\nEnglish remains comparatively lower yet not immune. A multi-metric audit\ncombining classifier-based toxicity with an LLM-as-a-judge reveals\nstereotype-laden content even when lexical toxicity appears muted, indicating\nthat conventional detectors under-estimate sociolinguistic harms. Additionally,\npoisoned models exhibit emergent jailbreaking despite the absence of explicit\nslurs in the poison, suggesting weakened alignment rather than memorization.\nThese findings underscore the need for dialect-aware evaluation, content-level\nstereotype auditing, and training protocols that explicitly decouple style from\ntoxicity to prevent bias amplification through seemingly minor, style-based\ncontamination.",

Although humans can solve these tasks\nwith ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training\nat scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit\nreasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior\nin latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.\nSpecifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which\nhigh-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given\nobservations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or\nfilling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of\nthis formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,\nthe latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the\ncorrect answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent\nvariables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit\nstrong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,\ncalled SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback\ninto the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense\ndependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key\nmodules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and\nperiodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach\nyields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over\n10$\\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku\nand Maze tasks over the recent advances.",

Offline RL offers a promising\navenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly\nreal-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly\ncomplex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and\nflow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either\nbackpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or\npolicy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability\nto larger base policies.

At\ninference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection\nsampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient\noptimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.\nEmpirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of\noffline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value\nlearning into offline RL.",

    "title": "LLMs Learn to Deceive Unintentionally: Emergent Misalignment in\n  Dishonesty from Misaligned Samples to Biased Human-AI Interactions",
    "summary": "Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect\ncompletions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical\nadvice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is\ncalled emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this\nphenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of\ndishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under\npressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced\nLLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.\nAdditionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined\nfinetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment\ndata into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior\nover 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction\nenvironment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the\nassistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned\nunintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user\npopulation. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the\ndomain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate\nthat this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in\ndownstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.",

    "summary": "Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,\nyet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex\ncorrelations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance\nits performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms\nof the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how\nan Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through\nrepeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a\nworld governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the\nsystem's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to\naccurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve\nthis, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques\nto analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show\nbetter performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but\nthe most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as\nlow as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging\nconfiguration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.",

    "title": "Memory Retrieval and Consolidation in Large Language Models through\n  Function Tokens",
    "summary": "The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their\nability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during\npre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling\nadvanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and\nreasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in\nLLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token\nhypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens\nactivate the most predictive features from context and govern next token\nprediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens\n(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of\nlearned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory\nconsolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in\nlinguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and\nconjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental\nevidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show\nthat a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case\nstudies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive\nfeatures from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during\npre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content\ntokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select\nthe most predictive features from context.",

Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based\nsentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method.\nResults indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with\nuser-reported sentiment, though limitations remain.

    "summary": "Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's\nMultiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments\nin multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the\nhigh cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of\ninconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value\nscales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel\nelicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM\nrequires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and\nconsistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)\nelicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,\n(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)\nderivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed\napproach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces\nthe dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.\nFurthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus\nit can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based\ntool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making\nscenarios.",

    "summary": "Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,\nDeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon\ntasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond\nto complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of\nLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to\nstimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.\nBased on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising\ncomplex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long\nreasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the\nR-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer\nsignificant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit\nlimited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget\nacross multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use\nR-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning\nwith verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,\nRLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the\nmulti-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning\ntasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as\na scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating\nthe long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.",

While the on-policy\nLV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the\nlog-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward\nprocesses, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when\ndiffusion coefficients are learned.

Our\nanalysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick\n(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently\noutperforms the LV loss.

MoE-based LLMs heavily\ndepend on a superficial safety mechanism in which harmful inputs are routed\nsafety-critical experts. However, our analysis reveals that routing decisions\nfor harmful inputs drift significantly after fine-tuning, exposing a critical\nvulnerability to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. Existing defenses,\nprimarily designed for monolithic LLMs, are less effective for MoE LLMs as they\nfail to prevent drift in harmful input routing. To address this limitation, we\npropose SafeMoE, a safe fine-tuning method tailored to MoE LLMs. SafeMoE\ndirectly mitigates routing drift by penalizing the gap between the routing\nweights of a fine-tuned model and those of the initial safety-aligned model,\nthereby preserving the safety-aligned routing of harmful inputs to\nsafety-critical experts. Experiments on open-source MoE LLMs ranging from 7B to\n141B parameters demonstrate that SafeMoE effectively mitigates HFT attacks,\nreducing the harmfulness score of OLMoE from 62.0 to 5.0, for example, while\nmaintaining task utility within 1% degradation and incurring only 2% overhead.\nIt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods for safeguarding\nLLM fine-tuning and remains effective in recent large-scale MoE LLMs such as\ngpt-oss and Llama 4.

    "summary": "Advances in large language models (LLMs) and real-time speech recognition now\nmake it possible to issue any graphical user interface (GUI) action through\nnatural language and receive the corresponding system response directly through\nthe GUI. Most production applications were never designed with speech in mind.\nThis article provides a concrete architecture that enables GUIs to interface\nwith LLM-based speech-enabled assistants.\n  The architecture makes an application's navigation graph and semantics\navailable through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The ViewModel, part of the\nMVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, exposes the application's capabilities to\nthe assistant by supplying both tools applicable to a currently visible view\nand application-global tools extracted from the GUI tree router. This\narchitecture facilitates full voice accessibility while ensuring reliable\nalignment between spoken input and the visual interface, accompanied by\nconsistent feedback across modalities. It future-proofs apps for upcoming OS\nsuper assistants that employ computer use agents (CUAs) and natively consume\nMCP if an application provides it.\n  To address concerns about privacy and data security, the practical\neffectiveness of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled\nmultimodal UIs is evaluated. Findings suggest that recent smaller open-weight\nmodels approach the performance of leading proprietary models in overall\naccuracy and require enterprise-grade hardware for fast responsiveness.\n  A demo implementation of the proposed architecture can be found at\nhttps://github.com/hansvdam/langbar",

    "summary": "The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their\nadoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language\nprocessing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes\ntheir deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models.

Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by\ninducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability\nfor unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual\nInstruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual\npre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for\nbusiness conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that\nrely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and\nresponses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling\nbetter instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nDACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of\nbusiness conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item\ngeneration, and call purpose identification.

We show that the entropy threshold to stop\nreasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot\nusing only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results\nindicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a\ncorrect answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be\nexploited to save tokens and reduce latency.

In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently\ndraws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide\nlogically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding\noutputs.

However, they often retain irrelevant\ninformation beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising\nconcerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This\nhas motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to\nselectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model\nperformance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily\nfocused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize\nspecified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely\nforgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For\ninstance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars\nwhile avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside\nadvertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous.

ADU\npresents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization\ncapability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in\nthe feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains\nineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that\nexplicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures\ninstance-specific domain information.

To address this, we propose a method to\ndistill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient\nmodels. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,\nenabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the\nneed for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer\ngeneration and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window\nmethod that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution\nfor RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer\nquality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher\nmodel for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into\nRankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex\nquestions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in\nenhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking\nand utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting\nfurther research in this area.",

    "summary": "Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being\nused at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is\nimperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In\nthis work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based\nglobal policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:\n1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates\nverifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global\nVerifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and\nverification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on\nseven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that\nthe extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the\nLLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to\ntext perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study\nto evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.",

    "summary": "Rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred demand for\nprocessing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However,\nthis progress faces two challenges: performance degradation due to sequence\nlengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the\nquadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues limit LLMs in\nlong-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache\nSelection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate\nlong-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of\nnon-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV\nCache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism,\nTokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention\ncalculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we\ndesign the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query\nsimilarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel,\nsignificantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of\nTokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\\times$ speedup in attention computation\nand up to $2.28\\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing\nsuperior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference\nmethods.",

    "summary": "Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for\ne-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and\nbusiness outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,\nmaking its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on\nhand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to\nevolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce\nblack-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over\nquality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent\nframework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While\ndemonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general\nframework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,\ncomputable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating\nfeature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous\ntool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We\ndeploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user\nbase. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average\nreviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by\n0.27%.",

Social media platforms present a\nvaluable data source for early detection, yet this task faces two significant\nchallenges: 1) the need for medical knowledge to distinguish clinical\ndepression from transient mood changes, and 2) the dual requirement for high\naccuracy and model explainability. To address this, we propose DORIS, a\nframework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs). To integrate medical\nknowledge, DORIS utilizes LLMs to annotate user texts against established\nmedical diagnostic criteria and to summarize historical posts into temporal\nmood courses. These medically-informed features are then used to train an\naccurate Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) classifier. Explainability is achieved by\ngenerating justifications for predictions based on the LLM-derived symptom\nannotations and mood course analyses.

While conformal\nselection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)\ncontrol, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y\n> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as\nconjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the\nMulti-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal\nselection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a\nnovel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions\nand a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,\nthereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The\nintegration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous\nFDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments.

We\nsystematically study LLM knowledge materialization using miniGPTKBs\n(domain-specific, tractable subcrawls), analyzing termination, reproducibility,\nand robustness across three categories of metrics: yield, lexical similarity,\nand semantic similarity. We experiment with four variations (seed, language,\nrandomness, model) and three illustrative domains (from history, entertainment,\nand finance). Our findings show (i) high termination rates, though\nmodel-dependent; (ii) mixed reproducibility; and (iii) robustness that varies\nby perturbation type: high for seeds and temperature, lower for languages and\nmodels.

Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies exhibit extreme\nvolatility and are heavily influenced by rapidly shifting market sentiments and\nregulatory announcements, making them difficult to model using static\nregression models or neural networks trained solely on historical data [53].\nThe proposed framework overcomes this by structuring LLMs into specialised\nagents for technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, decision-making, and\nperformance reflection. The system improves over time through a novel verbal\nfeedback mechanism where a Reflect agent provides daily and weekly\nnatural-language critiques of trading decisions. These textual evaluations are\nthen injected into future prompts, al- lowing the system to adjust indicator\npriorities, sentiment weights, and allocation logic without parameter updates\nor finetuning. Back-testing on Bitcoin price data from July 2024 to April 2025\nshows consistent outperformance across market regimes: the Quantita- tive agent\ndelivered over 30% higher returns in bullish phases and 15% overall gains\nversus buy-and-hold, while the sentiment-driven agent turned sideways markets\nfrom a small loss into a gain of over 100%.

Existing\ncompensation solutions, such as piecemeal licensing agreements, lack\nscalability and technical rigour, while current data attribution mechanisms\nprovide only uncertain estimates and are rarely implemented in practice. This\npaper introduces a framework for a generative music infrastructure centred on\ndirect attribution, transparent royalty distribution, and granular control for\nartists and rights' holders. We distinguish ontologically between the training\nset and the inference set, which allows us to propose two complementary forms\nof attribution: training-time attribution and inference-time attribution. We\nhere favour inference-time attribution, as it enables direct, verifiable\ncompensation whenever an artist's catalogue is used to condition a generated\noutput. Besides, users benefit from the ability to condition generations on\nspecific songs and receive transparent information about attribution and\npermitted usage.

To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed\nRAGDiffusion, to enhance structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by\nassimilating knowledge from language models and external databases.\nRAGDiffusion consists of two processes: (1) Retrieval-based structure\naggregation, which employs contrastive learning and a Structure Locally Linear\nEmbedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and spatial landmarks, providing\nboth soft and hard guidance to counteract structural ambiguities; and (2)\nOmni-level faithful garment generation, which introduces a coarse-to-fine\ntexture alignment that ensures fidelity in pattern and detail components within\nthe diffusing.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities,\nenabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate\nhigh-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations\npresent a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially\nmisaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty\nestimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies\nhave not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic\nuncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty esti- mation. In this\npaper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied\nplanning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic\nuncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is\nsubdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation.\nThe overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network\ndistillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM\nfeatures. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings:\nkitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show\nthat, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates\nthat are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.",

Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due\nto its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In\npractical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$\nprojection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off\nbetween model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved\nconsiderable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as\nsuboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce \\textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates\nfunction-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that\nthe projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit\ndistinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.\nSpecifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential\nfor attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive\nto downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature\nrepresentations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging\nthese insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting\nthe principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the\nminor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.\nThis asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture\nthe specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both\nfinetuning performance and convergence efficiency.",

Existing methods rely on\ngenerating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward\nmodel, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space.\nHowever, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base\npolicy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited\neffectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy\nAdaptation ($\\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for\ninference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete\nspace, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the\noptimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space.\nSpecifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure\non an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the\noptimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment.

    "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex\nreasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.\nHowever, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant\nreasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling\nthe length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open\nchallenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent\npositive correlation between model entropy and response length at different\nreasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher\nentropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final\nanswer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This\nobservation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a\ncontrol knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,\nthis paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism\nthat incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of\ntreating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the\nthinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,\nwhich encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain\nsufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive\ncontrol of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid\ntruncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that\nPEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy\nacross model scales.

In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor\nattacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\\ Vector\\\n(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned\nbackdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into\nattacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their\nsimilarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that\nenhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\\ Backdoor\\ Vector\\\n(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core\nvulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\\ triggers$ that exploit\nadversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose\n$Injection\\ BV\\ Subtraction\\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against\nbackdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the\nfirst method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness.

We show that the BNN enables the exact\nrepresentation of continuous piecewise linear functions (CPLFs), ensuring\nstrict continuity across segments. Given that any continuous function on a\ncompact domain can be uniformly approximated by CPLFs, the BNN emerges as a\nflexible and interpretable tool for function approximation.\n  To enhance geometric fidelity in low-resource scenarios, such as those with\nfew base points to create BNNs or limited training epochs, we propose\nlength-weighted persistent entropy (LWPE): a stable variant of persistent\nentropy.

These previous works have found that language\nmodel embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they\ndo not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as\ncontinuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear\nreconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models\nnot only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce\nsignificant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google\nGemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high\nfidelity ($R^2 \\geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of\nvariation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components\nwithin the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.\nFurther, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with\nincreasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space\nbeing fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have\nimplications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular\nwhere high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are\ncommon.",

    "summary": "Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting,\nreproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different\nstakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This\ndivision of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the\ncommunication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the\nprocess from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly\nasynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying\nfixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug\ntracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS\nplatforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking\nframework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model\n(LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing\ntime-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural\nlanguage, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request\nmissing details.

    "summary": "Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\ndiverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI\nagents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a\ncritical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from\nexperience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously\nimprove on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent\nframework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered\naround a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of\nexperience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across\nmultiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously\nreflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured\nexperience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism\nenables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering\ncontinuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon\nproductivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant\nmargin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments\ndemonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits\nincreasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust\ncontinuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated\nexperience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling\nzero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI\nagents capable of real-world productivity task automation.",

This omission undermines their\nadaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,\nand conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from\ngenuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we\npropose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic\ninformation management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.\nReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an\ninformation-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive\ninteraction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,\nand a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency\nvalidation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained\nuser-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing\napproaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it\nenables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,\nreal-world scenarios.

Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,\nenable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.\nWhile the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved\nsignificantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In\nthis work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be\nmaliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that\nappears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is\nbased on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates\nhow likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary\ncan first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely\nto be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are\nlikely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the\nunpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive\nevaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied\n(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious\nbehaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\\%$\nfor jailbreak, $98.7\\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\\%$ for\ntargeted content injection).

While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR\nhave set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can\nbe a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical\ntrade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art\nSwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\non this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but\nimportant finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher\npeak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the\nlightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,\nthe CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of\ntraining, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This\nefficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times\nsmaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a\nnear state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,\npresenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource\nconstraints are a primary concern.",

Despite significant advances in\nlearning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain\ndifficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw\ndata or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To\novercome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit\ncardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these\ndependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven\ncardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw\ndata access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we\npropose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding\nraw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic\nrepresentation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a\nlarge-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard\non it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate\nrepresentations. After pretraining, ZeroCard's parameters can be frozen and\napplied in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments to\ndemonstrate the distinct advantages of ZeroCard and show its practical\napplications in query optimization.

In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error\nand excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering\nthese two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the\noptimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially\ntightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better\nsolutions. 2).

At\nits core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement\nlearning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a\nhigh-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline\nverifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning\nsteps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data\nfiltering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate\npolicy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster\nprogressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search\nbenchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and\nrelevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming\nSFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and\nrobustness.",

    "summary": "Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their\npotential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model\ndevelopers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can\naddress these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,\nwhether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under\ndistribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play\nsafety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.\nUsing data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects\nsafety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a\npatch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches\nto meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a\nsingle, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,\nmaking it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.\nWe conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.\nEmpirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe\ncontent generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative\narchitectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of\nbenign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including\nboth external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all\nbaselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the\nprobability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%\nfor most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial\nattacks.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in\nreasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is\nresource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled\ndemonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a\nfraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a\ncounterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language\nmodels (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the\nlatter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that\nleverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a\nweaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a\nsampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs\nsupervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur\ncontrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these\ndistilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven\nmathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while\nreducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token\nusage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker\nSLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and\nresource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning.

In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of SSL for\nsleep staging using wearable EEG.

Three evaluation scenarios\nare defined to study label efficiency, representation quality, and\ncross-dataset generalization. Results show that SSL consistently improves\nclassification performance by up to 10% over supervised baselines, with gains\nparticularly evident when labeled data is scarce. SSL achieves clinical-grade\naccuracy above 80% leveraging only 5% to 10% of labeled data, while the\nsupervised approach requires twice the labels.

However, existing\nmethods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,\nleading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational\nresources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation\n(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing\ngeneration efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely\nexisting parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable\nconditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert\n(CoMoE) module.

We further demonstrate the versatility of our method by\nevaluating it on speech styles, including speaker identity and emotion.\nQuantitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness and generality of the\nproposed approach.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit\nof AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver\npersonalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM\ncapabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine\ncontextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has\nbeen studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,\nexisting perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on\ntechnical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified\ndefinition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical\nrequirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with\nestablished agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or\nmulti-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent\nmemory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to\nenable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three\npublic datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,\nor BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study\nproviding initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The\nstudy provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the\npotential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the\nadaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in language\nunderstanding and reasoning across diverse domains. Recently, there has been\nincreasing interest in utilizing LLMs not merely as assistants in optimization\ntasks, but as primary optimizers, particularly for network-structured\ncombinatorial problems. However, before LLMs can be reliably deployed in this\nrole, a fundamental question must be addressed: Can LLMs iteratively manipulate\nsolutions that consistently adhere to problem constraints? In this work, we\npropose a systematic framework to evaluate the capability of LLMs to engage\nwith problem structures. Rather than treating the model as a black-box\ngenerator, we adopt the commonly used evolutionary optimizer (EVO) and propose\na comprehensive evaluation framework that rigorously assesses the output\nfidelity of LLM-based operators across different stages of the evolutionary\nprocess. To enhance robustness, we introduce a hybrid error-correction\nmechanism that mitigates uncertainty in LLMs outputs. Moreover, we explore a\ncost-efficient population-level optimization strategy that significantly\nimproves efficiency compared to traditional individual-level approaches.\nExtensive experiments on a representative node-level combinatorial network\noptimization task demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and inherent\nlimitations of LLM-based EVO.

However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)\nbetween co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous\nstudies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.\nRegardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular\nbinding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI\nPrediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a\nnovel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical\ninformation into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density\nmaps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction\nrisks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic\nproperties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure\ninteractions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of\ndrug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442\nsubstructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a\ncomparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically\nsignificant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),\nand the DDI rate (p = 0.0386).

However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral\noptimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of\nboth citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.\nTransparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions\nmade about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,\ntransparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of\ntechnical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These\nare often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for\naction, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of\ndecision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a\nhuman-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems\nview, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:\ntransparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their\nlives, connecting understanding with potential for action.",

    "summary": "Linear sequence modeling methods, such as linear attention, state space\nmodeling, and linear RNNs, offer significant efficiency improvements by\nreducing the complexity of training and inference. However, these methods\ntypically compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size memory\nstate, which leads to suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce a novel architecture called\nMixture-of-Memories (MoM). MoM utilizes multiple independent memory states,\nwith a router network directing input tokens to specific memory states. This\napproach greatly enhances the overall memory capacity while minimizing memory\ninterference. MoM serves as a general framework that can be seamlessly combined\nwith diverse memory update mechanisms across linear models. As a result, MoM\nperforms exceptionally well on recall-intensive tasks, surpassing existing\nlinear sequence modeling techniques. Despite incorporating multiple memory\nstates, the computation of each memory state remains linear in complexity,\nallowing MoM to retain the linear-complexity advantage during training, while\nconstant-complexity during inference. Our experimental results show that MoM\noutperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks,\nparticularly recall-intensive tasks, and even achieves performance comparable\nto Transformer models.

To address\nthis challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit\nrewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence\nwith Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in\nLLM generation.

Flow-based\ngenerative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning\ndistributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus\nachieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.\nHowever, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the\ninability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in\nprecise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive\nRegularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching\nframework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent\ncollapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive\nregularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,\nencouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing\nadditional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on\nRoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s\nvs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the\nLift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment\non a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from\nsimulation to the physical world.

A key component for such systems is the automated\nevaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical\nchallenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via\nself-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We\nprovide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet\ndataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various\nchemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic\ndevelopment. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using\nself-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between\nthe modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration\nof machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context\nof the TOXBOX project.",

    "summary": "An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,\nbut effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during\ninteractions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory\nmodule for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as\nMemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects\nrecall performance and response quality. In order to better construct\nhigh-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory\nsystem (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes\nshort-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs\nretrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,\nwith a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,\nMMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's\nquery. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the\ncontext for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively\nutilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method\nwith three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the\nrationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the\nnumber of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its\npractical value.",

However, the performance of existing\nanomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large\nvolume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches\nbased on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed.\nNevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between\nsource and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this\npaper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on\nactive domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active\nlearning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to\ntrain a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the\nother hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based\nsampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual\nlabeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with\nminimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different\ncombinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01%\nF1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art\nmethods by 26.28%.

To address these challenges, we propose\nCityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle\nnavigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which\ncoordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local\nnavigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global\ndirectives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative\nreasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a\ndual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while\nshared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.\nExtensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to\n1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate\nthat CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based\nbaselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation.

    "summary": "With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended\ntasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's\nlack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However,\nquantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the\npresence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.\nWhile bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may\nalso reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we\nconduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that\nmitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in\nGPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information\nwhen model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect\nmeasured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free\nconfidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases\nhave greater effects in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is\nlower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence is associated with greater\nbias-induced underestimation of epistemic uncertainty, resulting in\noverconfident estimates, whereas it has no significant effect on the direction\nof bias effect in aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects\ndeepen our understanding of bias mitigation for uncertainty quantification and\npotentially inform the development of more advanced techniques.",

    "summary": "While large reasoning models have shown remarkable ability to generate long\nchains-of-thought (CoTs) in English, we still lack understanding of how these\nlong-form reasoning abilities transfer to the vast majority of the world's\nlanguages. In this work, we systematically investigate four key stages of model\ndevelopment--scaling, pretraining, post-training, and inference--to understand\nhow long CoT capabilities extend beyond English. We compare two reasoning\nsettings across nine non-English target languages: En-CoT, where models process\ntarget-language inputs, but reason in English; and Target-CoT, where models\nboth process inputs and generate long CoTs in the target language. We find that\nscaling reasoning model size improves multilingual task performance in En-CoT,\nbut Target-CoT performance lags behind. This gap widens for tasks requiring\nlong, multi-step CoTs such as mathematical reasoning. Shifting to pretraining,\nwe find that adding a specialized reasoning stage enhances En-CoT performance\nbut degrades Target-CoT, whereas broad multilingual pretraining improves both\nmodes simultaneously. Given the scarcity of high-quality reasoning traces in\nlanguages other than English, we explore synthetic data curation approaches for\npost-training. We demonstrate that fine-tuning on reasoning traces\nautomatically translated from gold English traces outperforms fine-tuning on\ntarget-language traces distilled from large reasoning models.

Existing research often depends on conspicuous\nUI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting\nstealth and real-world applicability.

Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1)\nlow-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious\napps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a\ntouch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical\ntouch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3)\none-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level\niterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot,\nkeyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters.

Current\ntraining methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL\nframework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these\ninefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for\nEfficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a\nfine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our\napproach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by\ndecomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We\nthen apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus\nbased on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of\ncommonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and\nLlama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method\nachieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B).

A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual\ndivergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.\nUnlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by\nstatic evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in\nmulti-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret\nits behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the\ntoken-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent\nreference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution\nas a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable\ninterventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon\nrewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\\tau$-Bench,\nmeasuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.\nOur experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather\nthan runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions\nreliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions.

    "title": "Learn the Ropes, Then Trust the Wins: Self-imitation with Progressive\n  Exploration for Agentic Reinforcement Learning",
    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic\ntool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,\nyet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.\nExisting studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but\nsuch mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to\nthe multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive\nexploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own\nexperiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway\ndivergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)\nrecipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a\nreplay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy\nupdate, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range\nof entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum\nto manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster\nskill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.\nAt first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the\naccumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar\ndistributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As\ntraining progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing\nsuccessful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level\nexploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.\nTo further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in\nthe replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such\nas the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and\nadvantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb\nover-confidence.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated\nenhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of\nthis tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific\ntools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable\nand specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating\ntool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability\nbottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an\nunstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an\nexpanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address\nthis, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an\nunstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system\nfirst generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into\nsemantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent\nframework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code\nto extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a\nreviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete\nfunctional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous\nquestion-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools\nwithout loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning\nperformance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows\nenhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific\nincreases.",

    "summary": "Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its\neffectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A\nsignificant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their\nreliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or\nsecurity concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time\nGraph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without\naccessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as\na generative graph restoration problem, \"restoring the target graph to its\npristine, source-domain-like state\". There are two key challenges: (1) We need\nto construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective\nencoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We\nneed to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic\nfeatures of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To\nensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores\nthe target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.\nSpecifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent\nfeatures and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration\nprocess. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete\ntokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to\ntransform a \"noisy\" target graph into a \"native\" one. To further improve\nrestoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by\nspecialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.",

    "title": "Parallel Test-Time Scaling for Latent Reasoning Models",
    "summary": "Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large\nlanguage models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based\nchains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or\nsearch. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning\nunfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to\nexplicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit\nfrom parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling\nmechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for\nadvanced trajectory aggregation. \\ This work enables parallel TTS for latent\nreasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two\nuncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive\nGaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)\ntrained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent\nreasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both\nsampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct\nexploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.\nTogether, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in\ncontinuous spaces.

    "title": "UltraLED: Learning to See Everything in Ultra-High Dynamic Range Scenes",
    "summary": "Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure\ndisparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly\nencountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure\nsettings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,\nmaking it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details\nsimultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends\nusing short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and\nghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains\nsufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in\ndenoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB\nimages, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise\ncharacteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This\nraises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only\na single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single\nshort-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making\nit particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce\nUltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio\nmap to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to\nenhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a\n9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a\ncorresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure\nas input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED\nsignificantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in\nfunction-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world\napplications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must\norchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across\nstates over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the\nlifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately\nevaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software\nsystems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark\nconsisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android\napps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a\nlanguage model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android\napp from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding\nand coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations,\ncalling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To\nconstruct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize\nthe main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize\ntest cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation.\nFollowing rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE\nincorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that\nenables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily\nadoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all\nevaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model\n(GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting\nfundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex,\nmulti-component software engineering challenges.",

Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR\nperforms a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained\nautoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,\ndata-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences\nautoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens\nwithin each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive\nexperiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient\nthan masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.\nBuilding on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion\nwith minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel\ngeneration. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures\nconfirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger\nrobustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups\nwithout accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning\nand domain adaptability.

    "summary": "In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control\nsynthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and\ncorrectness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal\ntemporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing\nreal-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of\nsystem behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important\nmethod for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent\nstudies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically\nsynthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards\nobtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial\npath but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the\nsparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training\nperformances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method\nguided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously\nmonitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,\ncomputing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and\nthereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.\nAdditionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to\novercome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it\ndifferentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool\nand evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled\nbenchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method\nwith online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL\nmethods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for\ndeep-RL.",

While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt\nslurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,\nstereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate\nspeech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic\ncues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.\nMoreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct\ngroups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations\nbetween them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.\nMotivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate\nspeech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual\nenvironment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we\npropose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles\nhate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,\nthereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.\nFurthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style\nwithin the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate\nspeech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in\ncomprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in\nadvancing generalizable hate speech detection.",

    "summary": "We introduce the Entropy-Driven Uncertainty Process Reward Model (EDU-PRM), a\nnovel entropy-driven training framework for process reward modeling that\nenables dynamic, uncertainty-aligned segmentation of complex reasoning steps,\neliminating the need for costly manual step annotations. Unlike previous\nProcess Reward Models (PRMs) that rely on static partitioning and human\nlabeling, EDU-PRM automatically anchors step boundaries at tokens with high\npredictive entropy, effectively capturing intrinsic logical transitions and\nfacilitating efficient exploration of diverse reasoning paths. On the\nProcessBench benchmark, EDU-PRM outperforms strong public PRM baselines, such\nas Math-Shepherd PRM and Omega PRM, and EDU-PRM achieves comparable results\nwith SOTA models while only using 1.5% training data. Furthermore, by\nleveraging our proposed EDU sampling strategy, we observe accuracy boosts from\n64.7% to 67.3% for generative reasoning tasks, accompanied by a reduction of\n32% in token usage.

Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to\nisolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ\nend-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks\nexplicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness\ninto LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a\nProgress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs\ndatasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a\nProgress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which\nintegrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy\nand improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.\nEmpirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of\nprogress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function\ncalling.",

    "summary": "Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in\ndeformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are\ninherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure\nmisalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the\nnumber of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements\nacross images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive\niterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the\naccumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced\nResidual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the\npyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical\nsemantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the\nfinal deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of\niterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled\nIterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration\nstability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to\nevaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as\nThreshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three\npublic brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP\noutperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of\naccuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model\nparameter size.

This study developed and validated\nthe PUGenAIS-9 (Problematic Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Scale-9\nitems) and examined whether PUGenAIS reflects addiction-like patterns under the\nInternet Gaming Disorder (IGD) framework. Using samples from China and the\nUnited States (N = 1,508), we conducted confirmatory factor analysis and\nidentified a robust 31-item structure across nine IGD-based dimensions. We then\nderived the PUGenAIS-9 by selecting the highest-loading items from each\ndimension and validated its structure in an independent sample (N = 1,426).\nMeasurement invariance tests confirmed its stability across nationality and\ngender. Person-centered (latent profile analysis) and variable-centered\n(network analysis) approaches revealed a 5-10% prevalence rate, a symptom\nnetwork structure similar to IGD, and predictive factors related to\npsychological distress and functional impairment. These findings indicate that\nPUGenAI shares features of the emotionally vulnerable subtype of IGD rather\nthan the competence-based type.

To address these issues, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet\neffective motion-based tracking method. BEVTrack directly estimates object\nmotion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) using a single regression loss. To enhance\naccuracy for targets with diverse attributes, it learns adaptive likelihood\nfunctions tailored to individual targets, avoiding the limitations of fixed\ndistribution assumptions in previous methods.

To overcome these obstacles,\ninnovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited\nfrom machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis,\nplacement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently\ndemonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL)\ngeneration, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an\nadvanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However,\nLLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high\nvalidation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet\ndesign capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based\nchiplet design generation framework that features six agents which\ncollaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical\ndescription generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based\nvalidation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components\ntogether enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized\nPower, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only\nsignificantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also\nincreases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by\nPass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case\nscenario.

We propose\nOptimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache\neviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal\nBrain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the\nperturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form\nscores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.\nOur scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from\nvalue states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction\nstrategies with output-aware signals.

    "summary": "While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of\nfuture returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the\nreturn distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable\napplications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for\nestimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical\ndistribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,\nsuch approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of\nthe return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return\nuncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,\nflexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and\nidentify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new\nflow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the\ndistributional Bellman equation.

In this work, we address two major\nshortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological\nfidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific\nphysiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional\ndiffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled\ninnovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a\nnovel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce\nphysiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning\nto enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach\non the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,\nclinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG\nachieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves\nstrong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by\n4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,\nwhile demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and\npersonalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets\nsupplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a\nclassifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG\nsynthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural\nregularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,\nprivacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the\nresponsible use of generative AI in healthcare.",

Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing\nbecause it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL,\nincluding sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a\nfundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions\nhave long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across\ntime is important.

In this paper, we build a probabilistic\nmodel to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant\nfuture (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are\noften constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include\nin our model a latent variable capturing the user intention.

We first explored different ways of partitioning the\nvideo into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more\naccurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we\nincorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA\nVLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the\nspace of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we\nhave successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action\nand scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning\npipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our\nmodel, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of\ncaptions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected\nin the video.",

    "summary": "In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.\nThe importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been\nacknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on\nOff-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,\nhowever, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.\nOur goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with\na guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy\nGradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high\nconfidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe\nOPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods\nviolate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be\ntoo conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety\nand exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel\nframework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User\nExploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety\nregularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus\nenables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of\nrecommender systems.",

    "summary": "Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies\nsuggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or\nbelow random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show\nthat widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model\ncapability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better\nexploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both\ncontrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test\ntime transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard\nevaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables\nSigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first\nresult surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,\nself-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any\nexternal supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for\nexample, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a\nnew state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on\nbenchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving\nrelative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16\ndataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM\nconsistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of\ncompositional reasoning.",

    "summary": "Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement\nsignals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these\nsignals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user\nsatisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel\ncontent-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users'\nintent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey\nmeasures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets\nforward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions\nand providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive\nRelevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent,\ndiscriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we\nshow that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals\nand other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for\nusers with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy\nmodel that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage\nranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based\non this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention,\nwhile reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale\nA/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework\nlinking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production\nsystems.

DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation\nNetwork) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by\ncombining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and\nbuilt-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges\nas Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic\nuncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware\ntrust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,\nit employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with\nKolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an\nordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly\ncapture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient\nanalysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary\ncosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,\nsabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN\ndelivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on\nBitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the\ncold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all\ntasks and datasets.

    "summary": "A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to\nretarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning\n(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the\nsignificant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically\nimplausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,\ncommon retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment\ninteractions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To\naddress this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data\ngeneration engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and\npreserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the\nterrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation\nbetween the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,\nOmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,\npreserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from\na single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object\nconfigurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions\nfrom OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour\ntrajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact\npreservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables\nproprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30\nseconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained\nwith only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,\nwithout any learning curriculum.",

    "summary": "Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced\nproblem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,\nthey frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error\ncascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire\nchain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification\nmodule that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and\ninserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk\nfollows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from\ncurated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to\ndetermine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a\nreinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The\nmodule is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing\norchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk\nconsistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent\nimplementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all\nless than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond\nempirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level\nerrors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable\npathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.",

    "summary": "Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)\nresearch. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric\nand DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks\ncomparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific\narchitectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving\nfield. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic\ngraph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To\naddress these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a\nresearch-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG\nand DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,\ntime-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and\ngraph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across\nmultiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an\naverage 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available\nimplementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks\nentirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property\nprediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions\npreviously impractical to study.

    "summary": "The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been\nsignificantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent\npreference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality\nimbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual\ninputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes\nhallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs\ndo not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model\n(LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on\noffline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to\ndynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified\nrewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM\nalignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,\nModality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality\nimbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset\nby generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due\nto limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of\ninput images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended\ntasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed\nto train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging\nvision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.",

Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives\n(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts\n(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical\nmarkers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited\nmarkedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of\nfear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed\nminimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of\nMonkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a\ndeliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a\ncombination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute\nto the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting\nlinguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public\nhealth messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in\nnetworked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges\nlimitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a\ndeliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate\nanalysis.

This\nsimultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and\nthe agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.\nHowever, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by\nrepeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we\nusually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than\nremaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a\non-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response\nquality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a\nparadigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as\nChain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly\ncausal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal\nhypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:\nreasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops\nspeaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.\nExperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through\nboth objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in\nresponse quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles\nconversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex\ninteraction metrics.",

    "summary": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread\napplications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental\nmonitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of\nhigh-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI\nclassification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in\nbalancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI\nclassification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial\ndata to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To\naddress this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion\nNetwork (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to\ncomplement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN\nleverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class\nlabel that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These\ndescriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text\nencoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in\nturn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification\nperformance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our\nmodel on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,\nHyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance\nboost.

    "title": "TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of\n  Physics Implausibility",
    "summary": "Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently\nproduce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects\nfloating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans\ncan easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for\nquantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore\nwhether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges\nof physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify\nphysics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and\ncausal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe\nthat combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention\nmodule to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate\nphysical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of\n300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and\nisolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with\ngold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,\nTRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving\nphysical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and\nunderexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.",

    "summary": "Instance segmentation demands costly per-pixel annotations and\ncomputationally expensive models. We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised\nknowledge distillation (SSKD) framework that compresses pre-trained vision\nfoundation models (VFM) into compact experts using limited labeled and abundant\nunlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three stages: (1) domain adaptation of the\nVFM(s) via self-training with contrastive calibration, (2) knowledge transfer\nthrough a unified multi-objective loss, and (3) student refinement to mitigate\nresidual pseudo-label bias. Central to CAST is an \\emph{instance-aware\npixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask and class scores to extract\ninformative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance margins. By maintaining\nthis contrastive signal across both adaptation and distillation, we align\nteacher and student embeddings and fully leverage unlabeled images. On\nCityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11x smaller student improves over its zero-shot VFM\nteacher(s) by +8.5 and +7.1 AP, surpasses adapted teacher(s) by +3.4 and +1.5\nAP, and further outperforms state-of-the-art SSKD methods on both benchmarks.",

    "summary": "AI-generated images have become so good in recent years that individuals\noften cannot distinguish them any more from \"real\" images. This development,\ncombined with the rapid spread of AI-generated content online, creates a series\nof societal risks. Watermarking, a technique that involves embedding\ninformation within images and other content to indicate their AI-generated\nnature, has emerged as a primary mechanism to address the risks posed by\nAI-generated content. Indeed, watermarking and AI labelling measures are now\nbecoming a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, including under the 2024\nEuropean Union AI Act. Despite the widespread use of AI image generation\nsystems, the practical implications and the current status of implementation of\nthese measures remain largely unexamined. The present paper therefore provides\nboth an empirical and a legal analysis of these measures. In our legal\nanalysis, we identify four categories of generative AI deployment scenarios and\noutline how the legal obligations could apply in each category. In our\nempirical analysis, we find that only a minority number of AI image generators\ncurrently implement adequate watermarking (38%) and deep fake labelling (18%)\npractices. In response, we suggest a range of avenues of how the implementation\nof these legally mandated techniques can be improved, and publicly share our\ntooling for the detection of watermarks in images.",

    "summary": "Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often\ndepends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to\nprobabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a\nvariety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be\nsensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different\nsettings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In\nthis work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to\nsampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step\nbased on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,\n$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality\noutputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on\n$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to\nempirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical\nreasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less\nsampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting\nmuch less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further\nshow how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative\nmethods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation\nlengths, without sacrificing accuracy.

    "summary": "Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning\nby letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.\nYet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to\nidentity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view\nor stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability\nof debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins\nsycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,\nwe formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update\nprocess. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity\nmarkers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish \"self\" from \"peer\", which\nforces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define\nthe Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how\noften an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple\nmodels, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,\nwith sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need\nto \"mask\" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather\nthan source identity.

Recent advances in\nmultimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization\nand visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series\nremains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and\ndiscrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel\nframework that leverages multimodal large language models for general\ntime-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series\nchannel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one\ncomposite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a\ntemporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with\ntheir corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details\nfrom the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the\nvisual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal\ntime-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,\nclassification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).\nThese results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with\npretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series\nanalysis.",

Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural\nLanguage (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the\npotential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However,\nRL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base\nmodel, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math\nreasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent\ndisparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning (NFL-HR)**, an\nend-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math\nproblem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the NL-FL\nProblem Alignment method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA)\nproblems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the Mixed Problem\nInput technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and\nexistence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output\nformat gap in reasoning through an LLM-based Answer Extraction mechanism.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that the NFL-HR framework achieves\n**89.80**% and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC\nbenchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by **4.60%** and **4.82%**,\nrespectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved\nby the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.",

    "title": "A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based\n  on an Image Purification Strategy",
    "summary": "Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but\nintroduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial\nmisalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses\nchallenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on\nsynthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT\ndenoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an\nImage Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT\nlung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates\nstructurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data\nfoundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a\nFrequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with\nthe IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of\ndenoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our\nIP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream\ndenoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined\nwith the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical\nstructure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data\nmismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available\nat https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.",

This work investigates the\nintrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary\ncontributions. First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic\nfailures, we propose Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST), a unified\nframework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a\ncausal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context\n(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a\nhallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific commitment layer where\na model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from factuality. Third,\nwe identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We observe a conflict\nbetween distinct computational pathways, which we interpret using the lens of\ndual-process theory: a fast, heuristic associative pathway (akin to System 1)\nand a slow, deliberate, contextual pathway (akin to System 2), leading to\npredictable failure modes such as Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks. Our framework's\nability to quantify the coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong\nnegative correlation ($\\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that\nthese failures are predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The\nresult is a mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur\nwithin the Transformer architecture.",

    "summary": "Risk management is a prominent issue in peer-to-peer lending. An investor may\nnaturally reduce his risk exposure by diversifying instead of putting all his\nmoney on one loan. In that case, an investor may want to minimize the\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) or Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of his loan portfolio.\nWe propose a low degree of freedom deep neural network model, DeNN, as well as\na high degree of freedom model, DSNN, to tackle the problem.

The experiments demonstrate that both models can\nsignificantly reduce the portfolio VaRs at different confidence levels,\ncompared to benchmarks.

This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native\nform of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates\nknowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on\nestablished benchmarks.

Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously\nexecute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path\nenergy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out\nunreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate\noptimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the\ncalculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings\nindicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states\ncorresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities\ncan be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of\nobtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is\nonly 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can\nstill be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter.

To validate and exploit this\ninsight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification\nframework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the\nrelationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV\nproduces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally\nidentifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV\ncache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for\nefficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of\nattention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression\napproach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction\nwith near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.",

This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,\nwhich provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning\n(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT\nmethod that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices\nof the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based\napproaches.

This\nmethod introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with\nexamples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We\nshow that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,\nincorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We\ndiscover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via\nself-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in\nnatural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of\nincorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful\nanswers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:\nwe insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it\ncontrols the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only\nsynonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in\nmachines.

The third\nedition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to\nfour datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm\ndetection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include\nnot only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments\nas well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to\nevaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models\npredict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist\napproach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.\nCrucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested\nnew evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse\nparticipation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and\nlimitations of methods to modeling variation.

To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,\na unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically\nallocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is\nmotivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is\nnoisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a\nsliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)\nreducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for\nsolving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage\ntraining pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and\ntextual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem\ndifficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the\nsecond stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which\nuses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a\nhierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to\nexplore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior\nperformance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and\nmultimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems\nunder significantly lower inference costs.",

It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as\nit influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and\nmake decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how\nacceptable a conditional \"If A, then B\" is, their judgments are influenced by\ntwo main factors: the $\\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and\nthe $\\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent\n$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has\nexamined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional\nstatements, it remains unclear how these models judge the\n$\\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a\ncomprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across\ndifferent model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear\nmixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both\nconditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees\ndepending on architecture and prompting style.

    "summary": "In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to\nlearn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.\nPast studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way\nthese in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are\nrepresented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the\nlearning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context\ndemonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is\noften thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between\nthese two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in\ndepth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one\nanother, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline\naccuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on\ntop of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization\nalgorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets\n(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with\nvarying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We\nobserved that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set\nitself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over\nin-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the\nparameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of\nlearning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set\n(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our\nhypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously\nunderexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from\ndemonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.",

In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to\neither (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on\nimplicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by\npsychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for\nefficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among\nthe first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as\nstructured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -\nexplicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework\noutperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%\non implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while\nsignificantly lowering LLM cost.",

    "summary": "The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of\ntrustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed\ninstructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized\nadversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt\ngeneration framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed\noperates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,\nand (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve\nefficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without\nquerying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --\nAutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.\nAutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than\nexisting baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based\napproaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM\nsafety evaluation.

However, LLMs\nexhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while\nthe mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To\nfill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that\ndrive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with\nadditional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general\nneurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and\nculture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture.

    "summary": "Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful\nand harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing\nchallenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,\nand a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current\napproaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely\nreject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music\nentirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance\nfor queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we\npropose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that\nformulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL\njointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is\nincentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and\nhelpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a\nDynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the\nconversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or\noverrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than\ndiscarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent\nand only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency\non safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,\ndemonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,\nfrom 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on\nOR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and\nfeedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances\nLLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto\nfront between helpfulness and harmlessness.",

However, their performance in specialized\nreal-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating\nexternal tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic\nreinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely\non costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase\nwith Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output\ndistribution.

To this end, we\npropose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),\na cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any\nparameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage\ninstead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling\nhigh-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal\nground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is\nseamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior.

    "summary": "Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric\napproaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during\ninteraction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness\nalone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between\nresponse quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the\nmechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce\nQoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles\nfrom networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext\nidentifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates\nthem into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under\nvaried configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database\nand train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from\nmeasurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only\nenables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable\nguidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.",

    "summary": "Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to\ndata poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden\nbehaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works\nassume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited\nunderstanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within\nthe model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in\nLLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a\nsingle model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed\nseveral triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding\nsimilarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation\neven when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings\nexpose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate\nthis threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains\nspecific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our\nmethod effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter\nupdates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger\npoisoning.",

This approach plays a\nvital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and\nreliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment\npreference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses\ngenerated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This\npaper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised\nmulti-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent\njudgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates\nvarious LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the\ninteractive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent\nunsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised\nmodels trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled\nannotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client\nagents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.\nFurther analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference\nbias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

    "summary": "Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models\n(LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and\nsubstantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have\nattempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods\noften require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in\nlength and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present\nlong-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an\neffortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can\nmarkedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling\nshort instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate\nresponses based on long-context meta-instructions.

Effective regulation requires applying legal\nknowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of\nundisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as\nopaque \"black boxes\". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels\nof legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying\ncontent as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over\n10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning\nerrors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references\n(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While\nadding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not\nconsistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is\nthreefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology\nby providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to\nevaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally\nrobust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing\ncontent. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated\nby two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it\ncombines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM\nexplanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support\nadvertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid\nlegal foundation.",

Despite growing adoption,\nthe capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge\nremains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary\nLLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a\nprototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified\nlocations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\\deg} resolution land\npoints, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses\nagainst ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate\nstructure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with\nroot-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\\deg}C and biases of $\\pm$1 {\\deg}C. However,\nspatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.\nPerformance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\\deg}C\ncompared to 2-4 {\\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic\ncontext (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger\nmodels being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the\nglobal mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they\nfail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate\nto assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may\ncapture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the\nregional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for\nunderstanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a\nreproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and\ncomplements existing climate communication assessments.",

To address this gap, we introduce\nCQBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' capability to infer\nimplicit cultural values from natural conversational contexts. CQBench consists\nof multi character conversation based stories using values from the World Value\nSurvey and the GlobalOpinions, with topics including ethical, religious,\nsocial, etc. Our automatic dataset construction pipeline integrates rigorous\nvalidation procedures (incorporation, consistency, and implicitness checks),\nachieving a 94.5% human model agreement in the final validation. To leverage\nCQBench data, we design three tasks of increasing complexity: attitude\ndetection, value selection, and value extraction. These tasks evaluate whether\nmodels can detect attitude and recognize values embedded within natural\ndialogues rather than relying on explicit cultural knowledge. We find that\nwhile frontier models like o1 reach human level performance in value selection\n(0.809 F1), they still fall short in nuanced attitude detection (0.622 F1).\nNotably, finetuning a smaller LLaMA-3.2-3B on only 500 culturally rich examples\nimproves performance by over 10%, even outperforming o3-mini in some cases.\nUsing CQ-Bench, we provide insights into the current challenges in LLMs' CQ\nresearch and suggest practical pathways for enhancing LLMs' cross-cultural\nreasoning abilities.",

    "summary": "This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian\nLanguage between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models\n(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors\naddress three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word\nforms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on\nsources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a\nunified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648\ndictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic\nenrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%\nof headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732\ndictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of\nheadword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the\nEstonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping\ntiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text\nrecognition and a second for merging the structured output.

    "summary": "In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and\nleveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.\nDespite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing\neither retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with\nlittle attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited\ncoordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely\nheavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize\nexisting problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization\nability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some\nstudies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general\ndomains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not\nadequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented\n**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In\nthis framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical\nreasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,\nwe adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the\ncharacteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization\nthroughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the\nmodel's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate\nthat **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by\n3.93\\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with\nMed-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\\%.",

This failure is particularly\nacute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning\nchains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an\noversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at\nthe neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit\nsubjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding\nvalue neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the\nfinal answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,\nwe propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual\nRecall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and\nedit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically\ngrounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals\nmore fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the\nsemantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven\naccumulation.

    "summary": "Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior\nperformance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a\ncritical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often\nengage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring\nsignificant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has\nexplored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our\nunderstanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to\nsuperficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner\nworkings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'\nthought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking\nissue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on\nsimple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose\nthe thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring\ndiscourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought\nprogression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for\ntopically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for\nopen-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides\nevidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of\noverthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a\nutility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based\nmetrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of\nLLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled\noverthinking management.",

    "title": "Less is More: Compact Clue Selection for Efficient Retrieval-Augmented\n  Generation Reasoning",
    "summary": "Current RAG retrievers are designed primarily for human readers, emphasizing\ncomplete, readable, and coherent paragraphs. However, LLMs benefit more from\nprecise, compact, and well-structured input, which enhances reasoning quality\nand efficiency. Existing methods often rely on reranking or summarization to\nidentify key sentences, but may suffer from semantic breaks and unfaithfulness.\nThus, efficiently extracting and organizing answer-relevant clues from\nlarge-scale documents while reducing LLM reasoning costs remains a challenge\nfor RAG. Inspired by Occam's razor, we frame LLM-centric retrieval as a MinMax\noptimization: maximizing the extraction of potential clues and reranking them\nfor well-organization, while minimizing reasoning costs by truncating to the\nsmallest sufficient clues set. In this paper, we propose CompSelect, a Compact\nclue Selection mechanism for LLM-centric RAG, consisting of a clue extractor, a\nreranker, and a truncator. (1) The clue extractor first uses answer-containing\nsentences as fine-tuning targets, aiming to extract sufficient potential clues;\n(2) The reranker is trained to prioritize effective clues based on real LLM\nfeedback; (3) The truncator uses the truncated text containing the minimum\nsufficient clues for answering the question as fine-tuning targets, thereby\nenabling efficient RAG reasoning. Experiments on three QA datasets show that\nCompSelect improves QA performance by approximately 11\\% and reduces Total\nLatency and Online Latency by approximately 17\\% and 67\\% compared to various\nbaseline methods on both LLaMA3 and Qwen3. Further analysis confirms its\nrobustness to unreliable retrieval and generalization across different\nscenarios, offering a scalable and cost-efficient solution for web-scale RAG\napplications.",

    "summary": "This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to\nattempt answering the question, \"Which issues contributed most to voters'\nchoice in the 2024 presidential election?\" The methodologies involve novel\nempirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using\ntwo distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering\nanalysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube\nvideos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left\nleaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the\nfrequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues\nwere most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November\n5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and\ndemocracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user\ncomments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity\npolitics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These\nresults corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute\nthe supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that\nvariations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can\nbe more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.",

Its goal is to provide seamless ride-hailing services and beyond\nthrough a natural and efficient conversational interface under dynamic and\ncomplex spatiotemporal urban contexts. To achieve this, we propose a\nspatiotemporal-aware order planning module that leverages external tools for\nprecise spatiotemporal reasoning and progressive order planning.

Furthermore, we introduce a\ncontinual fine-tuning scheme that utilizes real-world interactions and\nsimulated dialogues to align the assistant's behavior with human preferred\ndecision-making processes. Since its deployment in the DiDi application, DiMA\nhas demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 93% accuracy in order\nplanning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions. Offline\nexperiments further validate DiMA capabilities, showing improvements of up to\n70.23% in order planning and 321.27% in response generation compared to three\nstate-of-the-art agent frameworks, while reducing latency by $0.72\\times$ to\n$5.47\\times$.

    "summary": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enable efficient scaling of large\nlanguage models by activating only a subset of parameters per input. However,\nexisting MoE models suffer from two critical limitations: (1) inefficient\ntoken-to-expert routing that causes excessive communication overhead, and (2)\nexpert homogenization that leads to redundant computations. Current approaches\naddress these challenges separately, failing to achieve simultaneous\nimprovements in both training efficiency and model performance. We present\nExpert-Token Resonance (ETR), a theoretically-grounded bidirectional routing\nmechanism that fundamentally reimagines expert-token interactions in MoE\narchitectures. Our key insight is that optimal routing requires adaptive\ncoordination between token-choice routing (TCR) during early training phases\nand expert-choice routing (ECR) in later stages. We prove that this dynamic\napproach maximizes training success rate (the probability of correct\ntoken-expert assignments) while reducing the expert capacity lower bound by up\nto 40%. ETR incorporates three technical innovations: (1) an affinity-based\nrouting architecture using Grouped Average Pooling (GrAP) that reduces\ncomputational complexity from O(d^2) to O(d^2/D) while maintaining\northogonality to prevent expert homogenization; (2) a bidirectional selection\nmechanism that enables both tokens and experts to actively participate in the\nrouting process based on cosine similarity scores; and (3) an adaptive capacity\nstrategy that dynamically adjusts expert bounds based on training progress,\neliminating communication bubbles in All-to-All operations. Extensive\nexperiments on Ascend NPU clusters demonstrate that ETR achieves 5.4%-46.6%\nimprovements in end-to-end training efficiency compared to baseline MoE\nimplementations, with 9.7%-14.5% performance gains across GDAD, GPQA,\nHumanEval, and TeleQnA benchmarks.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to\naddress the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models\n(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic\nknowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically\ncarried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output\nmismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such\nerrors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively\nmodifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned\nparameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the\ngeometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and\nsimultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.\nFurthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that\nstrongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error\nrecovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect\nthese principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that\nensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By\ncombining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed\nmethod effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to\nbe more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply\nthe proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple\nlanguage understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better\nperplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.",

Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn\nrepresentations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a\nthreshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these\nmethods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,\nleading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a\nmulti-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,\nwhich constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge\npropagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the\ninteraction relations between instances with class information to propagate\nlabel knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)\ninstances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between\ninstances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent\nfor multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed\nto optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.\nExperiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC\nand 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.",

Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing\ntruthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we\ninvestigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often\ncomes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this\narises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode\nhallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress\nfactual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign\ndatasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same\nreason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related\nfeatures from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves\nrefusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This\napproach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety\nalignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful\nbenchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject).

    "summary": "Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with\noutcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,\nwe observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading\nto a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is\nevidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the\ncorrect final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic\nanalysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure\nmodes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct\noutput without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a\nstrong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the\nmodel appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To\nmitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a\nprocess-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory\nagainst problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,\ncalibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage\nrigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,\nRRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across\nfour math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from\n26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%.

We then conduct a rigorous\nevaluation of 15 state-of-the-art methods across three datasets, revealing that\nunlearned models still recall paraphrased answers and retain target facts in\ntheir intermediate layers. This motivates us to take a preliminary step toward\nmore generalised implicit knowledge forgetting by proposing PerMU, a novel\nprobability perturbation-based unlearning paradigm. PerMU simulates adversarial\nunlearning samples to eliminate fact-related tokens from the logit\ndistribution, collectively reducing the probabilities of all answer-associated\ntokens.

AOF\nimproves Distinct-2 (0.915 in Japanese), reduces Self-BLEU (0.177), and raises\nRiddleScore (up to +57.1% in Arabic). Human evaluations confirm fluency,\ncreativity, and cultural fit gains. However, improvements vary: Arabic shows\ngreater RiddleScore gains than Distinct-2; Japanese sees similar changes.\nThough focused on riddles, our method may apply to broader creative tasks.\nOverall, semantic filtering with composite evaluation offers a lightweight path\nto culturally rich generation without fine-tuning.",

    "title": "Efficient and Adaptable Overlapping for Computation and Communication\n  via Signaling and Reordering",
    "summary": "Generative models have achieved remarkable success across various\napplications, driving the demand for multi-GPU computing. Inter-GPU\ncommunication becomes a bottleneck in multi-GPU computing systems, particularly\non consumer-grade GPUs. By exploiting concurrent hardware execution,\noverlapping computation and communication latency becomes an effective\ntechnique for mitigating the communication overhead. We identify that an\nefficient and adaptable overlapping design should satisfy (1) tile-wise\noverlapping to maximize the overlapping opportunity, (2) interference-free\ncomputation to maintain the original computational performance, and (3)\ncommunication agnosticism to reduce the development burden against varying\ncommunication primitives. Nevertheless, current designs fail to simultaneously\noptimize for all of those features. To address the issue, we propose\nFlashOverlap, which utilizes a novel signaling mechanism: when part of the\noutput finishes, the computation kernel sends a signal to trigger the\ncommunication of that part, while continuing the computation of the remaining\npart (interference-free computation). Consequently, the communication of the\nfinished part and the computation of the remaining part can be overlapped. On\ntop of the signaling mechanism, FlashOverlap comprises two key components: (1)\nthe determination of the signaling timing to boost the overlap efficiency\n(tile-wise overlapping), and (2) a pre-communication reordering to create the\ncontiguous address for finished data, enabling communication by simply calling\nNCCL APIs (communication agnosticism), and a post-communication reordering to\ncorrect the data order. Experiments show that FlashOverlap achieves up to 1.65x\nspeedup through overlap, outperforming existing works in most cases. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/infinigence/FlashOverlap.",

    "summary": "Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise\njudgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.\nRecent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured\nnatural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.\nHowever, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key\nchallenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale\ncollection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and\nrubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive\nevaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which\nderives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit\nqualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve\nreliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to\nremove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our\nrubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines\nby 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and\nbiomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment\nsignals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated\nreward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has been the dominant\napproach for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has\nsimplified this paradigm by replacing the reward and value models with\nrule-based verifiers. A prominent example is Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO). However, GRPO inherently suffers from a length bias, since the same\nadvantage is uniformly assigned to all tokens of a response. As a result,\nlonger responses distribute the reward over more tokens and thus contribute\ndisproportionately to gradient updates. Several variants, such as DAPO and Dr.\nGRPO, modify the token-level aggregation of the loss, yet these methods remain\nheuristic and offer limited interpretability regarding their implicit token\npreferences. In this work, we explore the possibility of allowing the model to\nlearn its own token preference during optimization. We unify existing\nframeworks under a single formulation and introduce a learnable parameter\n$\\lambda$ that adaptively controls token-level weighting. We use $\\lambda$-GRPO\nto denote our method, and we find that $\\lambda$-GRPO achieves consistent\nimprovements over vanilla GRPO and DAPO on multiple mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks. On Qwen2.5 models with 1.5B, 3B, and 7B parameters, $\\lambda$-GRPO\nimproves average accuracy by $+1.9\\%$, $+1.0\\%$, and $+1.7\\%$ compared to GRPO,\nrespectively. Importantly, these gains come without any modifications to the\ntraining data or additional computational cost, highlighting the effectiveness\nand practicality of learning token preferences.",

    "summary": "Maintaining consistent model performance across domains is a fundamental\nchallenge in machine learning. While recent work has explored using\nLLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization\nremains poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing\nthat fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task\nperformance but also reduces non-target task degradation compared to\nfine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in\ntasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhancement of non-target\ntask robustness stems from the reduction of high perplexity tokens found in\nLLM-generated sequences. Following our findings, we showed that masking high\nperplexity tokens in ground truth training data achieves similar non-target\ntask performance preservation, comparable to using LLM-generated data.\nExtensive experiments across different model families and scales, including\nGemma 2 IT 2B, Llama 3 8B Instruct, and three additional models, agree with our\nfindings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an\nempirical explanation based on token perplexity reduction to mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting in LLMs after fine-tuning, offering valuable insights\nfor developing more robust fine-tuning strategies.",

The idea of the\nframework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating\nself-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer\nscoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 academic conferences, while\niteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where existing\nhypotheses cannot explain.

Human reviewers tend to explicitly\nreward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors (correlation =\n0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling posteriors in\ntheir review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving implicit reward to\nthem with positive scores.

To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory\ncomponents that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at\ndifferent levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific\nuser actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.\nThis dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,\nallowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors\nand abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)\nbenchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is\navailable\\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.",

We find that LLM performance drops on\nhigh-level questions, struggling to make accurate predictions and offer\nactionable plans.

    "summary": "In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time\nresponses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning\nModels (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage\noptimization framework to bridge this gap.

This\nreduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,\ncausing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning\nwith Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's\nreasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing\ncorrectness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold\nreduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world\napplication on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and\nhelpfulness by 21.8%.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when\ninstructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions\nprovide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about\npotential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to\nimprove response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction.\nThe empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various\napplications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on\nmoral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic\nself-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and\nprovide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our\nexperimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of\nconvergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral\nconcepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the\nactivated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds. This paper\ndemonstrates the strong potential of moral self-correction by showing that it\nexhibits a desirable property of converged performance.",

    "summary": "Diffusion language models offer parallel token generation and inherent\nbidirectionality, promising more efficient and powerful sequence modeling\ncompared to autoregressive approaches. However, state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match\nthe quality of similarly sized autoregressive (AR) models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B,\nLlama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward\npasses, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for\nlong input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token\ngeneration introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling\nheuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising\nsteps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First,\nwe propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that\nreuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the\ncomputational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a\ntraining-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to\nsupervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising\niterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on\nopen-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver an average\nof 12.14x end-to-end speedup across various tasks with negligible accuracy\ndegradation. For the first time, diffusion language models achieve a comparable\nand even faster latency as the widely adopted autoregressive models. Our work\nsuccessfully paved the way for scaling up the diffusion language model to a\nbroader scope of applications across different domains.",

We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language\ninference is a \"better\" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a\ncombination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive\nevaluation of language models.\n  Content Warning: This paper contains examples of anti-LGBTQ+ stereotypes.",

Despite rapid progress over the past two\nyears, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on\nwhat constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously\nevaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent\nstateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:\ndivergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and\nrejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the\nevaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and\nrobustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that\ncurrent evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,\noffer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking\nthe model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open\nquestion-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance\nand reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,\nvulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and\nout-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.\nThrough this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning\nand actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.",

    "summary": "We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of\nConstructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target\nphonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at\neach step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of\nsentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic\nmarkup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications\nof the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic\nfeature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using\nthe phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted\nfrom the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an\northography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or\nCyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the\nlanguage. The system can also translate further sentences into the target\nlanguage.\n  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for\ncreating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in\nexploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any\nparticular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and\nunderstand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly\nwide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different\nlinguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal\nwith more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore\nis the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into\nlow-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we\nprovide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could\nafford some real gains in such tasks.\n  https://github.com/SakanaAI/IASC",

    "title": "LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately",
    "summary": "LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand\nharmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our\nfindings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more\nrobust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a\nnew perspective to study AI safety.",

    "summary": "While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in\nenhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn\ntasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for\nmulti-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of\nlong-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we\npresent WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework\nfor training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web\nenvironments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided\nby binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite\nbenchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task\nsuccess rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to\n44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong\nproprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the\neffectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling\nthrough increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different\nRL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero\nand WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training\nstage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.",

Large language models\ndegrade with irrelevant or lengthy context, and multi-turn jailbreaks can\nscatter goals across turns. We present ObjexMT, a benchmark for objective\nextraction and metacognition. Given a multi-turn transcript, a model must\noutput a one-sentence base objective and a self-reported confidence.

Using real-world data from\n31,865 online shopping sessions containing 230,965 user actions, our evaluation\nreveals that prompt-based LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, Llama, Claude) achieve only 11.86%\naccuracy in generating human actions, highlighting a substantial gap in actual\nbehavioral accuracy.

In this paper, we first find that the current-step\nquery state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short\nwindow of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without\nwaiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework\nfor efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight\ntemporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an\nasynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering\nfrom the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV\nselection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism.

We validate the effectiveness of\nAsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade\nfully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving\ntheoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT).

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\ndiverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various\npractical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)\ncan outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing\neffective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded\ninstability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in\nautomated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt\noptimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially\nexpanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic\ndesign intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce\nM}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first\nformulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference\nproblem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief\npropagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system\niteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that\nintegrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent\nprompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated\nset of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,\nMAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually\nengineered baselines and recent automated alternatives.

    "summary": "Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional\nstrategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the\nfield's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist\nframing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to\nscale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the\nresults from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting\napproach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism\nDatabase (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated\nfor degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by\nprompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide\nthe model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models\nby replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific\nprompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par\nwith expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,\ncontext sensitive aspects of populism.",

Based on a comprehensive study using\ncircuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII\nleakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should\nbe responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware\nTargeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and\nsubsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves\nbetter privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall\nof PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to\nreduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis\nshows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing\ndefense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.",

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their\nability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there\nis no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization\ntask. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest\ngeneration of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the\ntraditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting\nin which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or\nlanguage, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned\nout-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma\ngeneration with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of\ndifferent morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain\ncompetitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current\nLLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating\nlemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.\nData and code available upon publication:\nhttps://github.com/oltoporkov/lemma-dilemma",

    "summary": "Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by\nsimple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,\nwhich typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often\nleads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of\nout-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we\ndevelop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.\nOur models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the\ninput byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing\ntokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss\nthat enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing\na new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective\nthat enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating\nacross multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and\ndomains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token\nover-fragmentation and achieves up to 10% improvements on downstream task\nperformance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers.

    "summary": "The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment\non memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter\noffloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can\ndegrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow\ninference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate\nparameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft\ntokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single\nforward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward\npasses that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on\npretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align\nwith custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model\ntraining usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from\ninsufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token\nacceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,\nwe propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading\nthat is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft\nmodel by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target\nLLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers\nand the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment.\nSubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for\nQwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for\nQwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).",

In these\nsettings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time\ninfractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly\nacross diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers.

Based on analysis in\nsimulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online\nsettings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of\ncurrent evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge\nthe gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric\nbased on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to\ncause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%\nimprovement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics.

The recent emergence of\nVideo-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders\nwith powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that\ntransforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated\nreasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.\nThis survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training\nmethodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)\nfrom verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced\ninference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the\nroles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,\naddressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal\ngrounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration.

However, the\nmultimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due\nto the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of\nMLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and\nscaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through\ncareful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal\nmeta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,\nwe further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the\npositively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.\nBased on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a\nsimple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal\nbenchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.\nBesides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future\nstudy of native MLLMs.",

    "summary": "End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future\ntrajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the\ninherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a\nsignificant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations\ninstead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant\npredictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we\npropose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.\nInstead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the\nlearning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial\nreference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model\nto move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying\ncausal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations\nfrom a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance\ncaused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise\nNormalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization\nobjective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain\nwaypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate\nthe effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a\nstate-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two\ndenoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the\nlearning task and improves model performance.

    "summary": "Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image\nframes, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video\nsynthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,\nor intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of\nuser intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate\nframes, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we\nintroduce \\modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal\ncontrols, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text\nprompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a\nbalance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video\ninterpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)\narchitecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to\ngenerate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our\nmulti-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and\nuser-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to\nrespect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity\nand influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two\nbranches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,\nresulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,\nwe propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the\nmulti-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,\ncustomizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.",

    "summary": "Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge\nin robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from\nsimulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous\nmanipulation create a \"reality gap\" that has limited prior work to constrained\nscenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,\nconstrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real\nchallenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in\nsimulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the\nreal world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns\nto bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world\ncollected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The\nmodel is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand\ninteraction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing\nsystem-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each\njoint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net\neffects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that\ngathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.\nOur complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy\nsuccessfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),\nhigh aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse\nwrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and\na teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/",

    "summary": "We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a\nvideo is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial\nlocation and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible\nformulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation\ntasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and\ninterpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,\nhowever, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:\nthe temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames\nare compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level\nconditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with\nVideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)\nparadigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose\na hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:\nspatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is\nachieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a\ncontinuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the\nVAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen\nbackbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the\nfirst benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both\nintra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that\nVideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,\nestablishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.",

    "summary": "On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a\nlong-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as\nreal-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:\nper-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,\nwhereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle\nwith accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified\nframework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the\nreliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose\nestimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that\ntransforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both\nfidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian\nrepresentation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering\nfidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and\noutdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance\ncomparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and\nreconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical\npath toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both\naccurate geometry and high visual fidelity.

However,\nmulti-object scenes remain challenging, as reliable control over object\ncategories, counts, and spatial layout is difficult to achieve. For that, we\nfirst study quantity and layout consistent image editing, abbreviated as\nQL-Edit, which targets control of object quantity and spatial layout in\nmulti-object scenes. Then, we present IMAGHarmony, a straightforward framework\nfeaturing a plug-and-play harmony aware (HA) module that fuses perception\nsemantics while modeling object counts and locations, resulting in accurate\nedits and strong structural consistency. We further observe that diffusion\nmodels are sensitive to the choice of initial noise and tend to prefer certain\nnoise patterns.

Empirical results on this\nbenchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits\nin long-chain reflective reasoning.

The\nintrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry,\nand lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive\nadjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these\nfunctionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to\nvideo generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention,\nwhich ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances\nfidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to\ndisentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto\nrespective local and global regions.

Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide\nhigh expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas\nprimitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time\nefficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power.\nInspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural\nprimitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of\nneural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive\nencodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural\nnetwork. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line\nintegrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting\nkernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays\nwithout the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to\nscene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the\nnumber required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach\nmatches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\\times$\nfewer primitives and $6\\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise\ndirectly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or\nadaptation frameworks. The project page is\nhttps://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/SplatNet/.",

    "summary": "Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled tool-augmented\nagents capable of solving complex real-world tasks through step-by-step\nreasoning. However, existing evaluations often focus on general-purpose or\nmultimodal scenarios, leaving a gap in domain-specific benchmarks that assess\ntool-use capabilities in complex remote sensing use cases. We present ThinkGeo,\nan agentic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-driven agents on remote sensing\ntasks via structured tool use and multi-step planning. Inspired by\ntool-interaction paradigms, ThinkGeo includes human-curated queries spanning a\nwide range of real-world applications such as urban planning, disaster\nassessment and change analysis, environmental monitoring, transportation\nanalysis, aviation monitoring, recreational infrastructure, and industrial site\nanalysis. Queries are grounded in satellite or aerial imagery, including both\noptical RGB and SAR data, and require agents to reason through a diverse\ntoolset. We implement a ReAct-style interaction loop and evaluate both open and\nclosed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Qwen2.5) on 486 structured agentic tasks with\n1,773 expert-verified reasoning steps. The benchmark reports both step-wise\nexecution metrics and final answer correctness. Our analysis reveals notable\ndisparities in tool accuracy and planning consistency across models. ThinkGeo\nprovides the first extensive testbed for evaluating how tool-enabled LLMs\nhandle spatial reasoning in remote sensing.",

To address this, we propose\nVideo-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition\nwith tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action\nrecognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic\nentities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative\nsub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking\ndomain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling\ncategory-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.\nMoreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage\nefficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our\nmethod autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns\nwithout explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to\nvisually grounded inference.

    "summary": "This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency\ndistillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.\nAlthough continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled\nand empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its\napplicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due\nto infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and\nthe limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a\nparallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on\nmodels with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our\ninvestigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail\ngeneration, which we attribute to error accumulation and the \"mode-covering\"\nnature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the\nscore-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates\nscore distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM\nwith the \"mode-seeking\" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual\nquality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale\nmodels (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM\nmatches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality\nmetrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning\nor extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate\nhigh-fidelity samples in only $1\\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling\nby $15\\times\\sim50\\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and\ntheoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion\ndistillation.",

In particular, GRPO demands a\nstochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on\ndeterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient\nSDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic\nGaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose\nDirect Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that\ndispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly\nfrom group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples\nwithin groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic\npolicies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster\ntraining.

    "summary": "The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on\nOdontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network\nextending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity\nvessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal\nfluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits\nthe extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this\nlimitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models\nto allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and\nrestore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models\n(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a\nunique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images\nacquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of\nx2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity\nand distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded\ninconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This\nraises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently\ntarget the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting\ninformation, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the\nspecific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by\ncomparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to\npreserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was\nevaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far\nbetter mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences\nin model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity\nin image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.",

We\ncollect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,\nsports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and\nextract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which\nare then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators.

Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security\nissues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation\nframeworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without\nthe consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process\nfrom source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model\nadaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely\nlearning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which\nconsists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former\ncurriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and\ngradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the\nsample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which\nensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We\nevaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public\ncross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation.

    "summary": "State-of-the-art methods for Transformer-based semantic segmentation\ntypically adopt Transformer decoders that are used to extract additional\nembeddings from image embeddings via cross-attention, refine either or both\ntypes of embeddings via self-attention, and project image embeddings onto the\nadditional embeddings via dot-product. Despite their remarkable success, these\nempirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations,\nthus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue\nthat there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and\ncompression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully\nattentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the\ninterpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image\nembeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the\nsupervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks\nto find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is\nexpected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and\ncorresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields\ncompact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks.

    "summary": "Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content\ngeneration and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this\nwork, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling\nto the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a\nMultimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate\ninterpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual\nconsistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video\ngeneration and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and\nis jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo\nmatches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in\ntext/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context\nvideo editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of\ngeneralization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining\nediting with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a\nsingle instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video\nediting, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image\nediting data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as\ngreen-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these\ncore capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,\nwhere the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.\nTo foster future research, we will release our model and code.",

    "summary": "Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given\nlinguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range\ntemporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to\ndepict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt\nattention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a\nglobal view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance\nbetween locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly\nincreases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an\neffective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate\nglobal context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the\nglobal context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local\nattentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window\nattention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such\nattention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each\nquery to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool\nto enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with\nall the other queries to directly encode the global context information.\nExperiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring\nvideo segmentation benchmarks.

Previous arts failed to address both of them,\nalways with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem\nfrom the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that\nencode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text\nprompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a\nnull-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \\textbf{NTN-Diff}, for\ntext-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across\nmasked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,\nwhile preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.\nBased on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into\nearly (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the\nmid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As\nobserved, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be\nsemantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,\nserves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise\nlow-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided\ndenoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for\nmid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve\nthe unmasked regions.

Local feature extraction requires capturing fine-grained anatomical\ndetails, while global modeling requires understanding the spatial relationships\nwithin complex anatomical structures.

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal\nreasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a\nphenomenon we call the \\textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at\nthe output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models\nexposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a\nsafety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly\ninto multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)\nQI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and\nreasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations\nundergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured\nreward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties\nfor hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which\nreinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts\nsafety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling\nscalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further\ndemonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting\ndynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.\nSaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and\nhelpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\\times$\nlarger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B.\nRemarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass\nGPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \\num{6.47} and \\num{16.76} points\nrespectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any\ndegradation in helpfulness performance.

    "summary": "Recent studies have indicated that vision models pre-trained on images can\nserve as time series foundation models (TSFMs) by reformulating time series\nforecasting (TSF) as image reconstruction. However, effective cross-modal\ntransfer from vision to time series remains challenging due to three\ndiscrepancies: (1) the data-modality gap between structured, bounded image data\nand unbounded, heterogeneous time series; (2) the multivariate-forecasting gap\nbetween fixed RGB-three-channel vision models and time series with arbitrary\nnumbers of variates; and (3) the probabilistic-forecasting gap between the\ndeterministic outputs of vision models and the requirement for\nuncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose\nVisonTS++, a TSFM based on continual pre-training of a vision model on\nlarge-scale time series. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1)\nvision-model-based filtering to identify high-quality sequences to stabilize\npre-training and mitigate modality gap; (2) colorized multivariate conversion,\nencoding multivariate series as multi-subfigure RGB images to enhance\ncross-variate modeling; (3) multi-quantile forecasting, using parallel\nreconstruction heads to generate quantile forecasts without parametric\nassumptions.

The text-driven\nediting branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring\nconsistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object\nattributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into\nnoise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects.

    "summary": "Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring\nchallenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.\nWhile methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,\nas distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often\nleading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel\nperspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from\nscratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually\n'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or\nlabel noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class\nimbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level\nconcern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness\nmechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without\nconflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel\nframework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating\ncomplementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.\nSpecifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label\nallocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a\nnoise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust\none. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK\nsignificantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in\nlearning from long-tailed noisy data.",

    "summary": "Numerous models have been developed for scanpath and saliency prediction,\nwhich are typically trained on scanpaths, which model eye movement as a\nsequence of discrete fixation points connected by saccades, while the rich\ninformation contained in the raw trajectories is often discarded. Moreover,\nmost existing approaches fail to capture the variability observed among human\nsubjects viewing the same image. They generally predict a single scanpath of\nfixed, pre-defined length, which conflicts with the inherent diversity and\nstochastic nature of real-world visual attention. To address these challenges,\nwe propose DiffEye, a diffusion-based training framework designed to model\ncontinuous and diverse eye movement trajectories during free viewing of natural\nimages. Our method builds on a diffusion model conditioned on visual stimuli\nand introduces a novel component, namely Corresponding Positional Embedding\n(CPE), which aligns spatial gaze information with the patch-based semantic\nfeatures of the visual input. By leveraging raw eye-tracking trajectories\nrather than relying on scanpaths, DiffEye captures the inherent variability in\nhuman gaze behavior and generates high-quality, realistic eye movement\npatterns, despite being trained on a comparatively small dataset. The generated\ntrajectories can also be converted into scanpaths and saliency maps, resulting\nin outputs that more accurately reflect the distribution of human visual\nattention. DiffEye is the first method to tackle this task on natural images\nusing a diffusion model while fully leveraging the richness of raw eye-tracking\ndata. Our extensive evaluation shows that DiffEye not only achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in scanpath generation but also enables, for the\nfirst time, the generation of continuous eye movement trajectories.

    "summary": "Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet\nexisting methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained\nspatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual\nCoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in\nits ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary\nvisual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel\nframework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based\nreasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our\nframework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved\ntext-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where\na textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a\npositional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new\ncontent. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large\nlanguage models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning\nparadigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.\nBy pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward\nmodel, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory\ntowards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing\ntasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage\nand yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for\ninterleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,\ncomprising 14K high-quality editing examples.

Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown\nremarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and\nhave begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this\nwork, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP\nenhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal\nAdapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters\nand is the only component that requires training. This design significantly\nreduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable\nquality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality\nvariations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.\nFurthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies\non VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to\nbetter generalization performance across datasets.

Different from the existing works,\nLLaVA-OneVision-1.5 provides an open, efficient, and reproducible framework for\nbuilding high-quality vision-language models entirely from scratch. The\nLLaVA-OneVision-1.5 release comprises three primary components: (1) Large-Scale\nCurated Datasets: We construct an 85M concept-balanced pretraining dataset\nLLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Traning and a meticulously curated 22M instruction\ndataset LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Instruct. (2) Efficient Training Framework: We\ndevelop a complete end-to-end efficient training framework leveraging an\noffline parallel data packing strategy to facilitate the training of\nLLaVA-OneVision-1.5 within a $16,000 budget. (3) State-of-the-art Performance:\nExperimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 yields exceptionally\ncompetitive performance across a broad range of downstream tasks. Specifically,\nLLaVA-OneVision-1.5-8B outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on 18 of 27 benchmarks, and\nLLaVA-OneVision-1.5-4B surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-3B on all 27 benchmarks.

    "summary": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as a promising alternative to\ntraditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), offering biological plausibility\nand energy efficiency. Despite these merits, SNNs are frequently hampered by\nlimited capacity and insufficient representation power, yet remain\nunderexplored in remote sensing super-resolution (SR) tasks. In this paper, we\nfirst observe that spiking signals exhibit drastic intensity variations across\ndiverse textures, highlighting an active learning state of the neurons. This\nobservation motivates us to apply SNNs for efficient SR of RSIs. Inspired by\nthe success of attention mechanisms in representing salient information, we\ndevise the spiking attention block (SAB), a concise yet effective component\nthat optimizes membrane potentials through inferred attention weights, which,\nin turn, regulates spiking activity for superior feature representation. Our\nkey contributions include: 1) we bridge the independent modulation between\ntemporal and channel dimensions, facilitating joint feature correlation\nlearning, and 2) we access the global self-similar patterns in large-scale\nremote sensing imagery to infer spatial attention weights, incorporating\neffective priors for realistic and faithful reconstruction.

    "summary": "Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,\ndeep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.\nRecent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to\nbackdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,\nthey rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the\nreal world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often\nprohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.\nEmbedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training\ndata, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a\nnovel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first\ndata-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel\nshadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds\nbackdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning\nonly specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider\nleveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to\nenhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment\nloss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the\ntarget sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on\nfour image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods\ndemonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing\nstate-of-the-art backdoor attack methods.

We leverage text-to-image diffusion models\npre-trained on billions of images and successfully introduce our DICEPTION, a\nvisual generalist model. Exhaustive evaluations demonstrate that DICEPTION\neffectively tackles diverse perception tasks, even achieving performance\ncomparable to SOTA single-task specialist models. Specifically, we achieve\nresults on par with SAM-vit-h using only 0.06% of their data (e.g., 600K vs.\\\n1B pixel-level annotated images). We designed comprehensive experiments on\narchitectures and input paradigms, demonstrating that the key to successfully\nre-purposing a single diffusion model for multiple perception tasks lies in\nmaximizing the preservation of the pre-trained model's prior knowledge.\nConsequently, DICEPTION can be trained with substantially lower computational\ncosts than conventional models requiring training from scratch. Furthermore,\nadapting DICEPTION to novel tasks is highly efficient, necessitating\nfine-tuning on as few as 50 images and approximately 1% of its parameters.\nFinally, we demonstrate that a subtle application of classifier-free guidance\ncan improve the model's performance on depth and normal estimation. We also\nshow that pixel-aligned training, as is characteristic of perception tasks,\nsignificantly enhances the model's ability to preserve fine details.

However, detecting such\nvideos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal\ndynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this\npaper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based\non probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a\nstatistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the\nratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly\ncapturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained\ndiffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients\napproximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion\ndecomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we\npropose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum\nMean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a\ndetection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances\nbetween real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit\namplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts.

In this way, the\ntargets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the\nclassification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular\nnetwork has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine\ntuning.

    "summary": "Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their\nproficiency in fine-grained video motion understanding remains critically\nlimited. They often lack inter-frame differencing and tend to average or ignore\nsubtle visual cues. Furthermore, while visual prompting has shown potential in\nstatic images, its application to video's temporal complexities, particularly\nfor fine-grained motion understanding, remains largely unexplored. We\ninvestigate whether inherent capability can be unlocked and boost MLLMs' motion\nperception and enable distinct visual signatures tailored to decouple object\nand camera motion cues. In this study, we introduce MotionSight, a novel\nzero-shot method pioneering object-centric visual spotlight and motion blur as\nvisual prompts to effectively improve fine-grained motion understanding without\ntraining. To convert this into valuable data assets, we curated MotionVid-QA,\nthe first large-scale dataset for fine-grained video motion understanding, with\nhierarchical annotations including SFT and preference data, {\\Theta}(40K) video\nclips and {\\Theta}(87K) QAs. Experiments show MotionSight achieves\nstate-of-the-art open-source performance and competitiveness with commercial\nmodels. In particular, for fine-grained motion understanding we present a novel\nzero-shot technique and a large-scale, high-quality dataset. All the code and\nannotations will be publicly available.",

    "summary": "Curvature angle is a quantitative measurement of a curve, in which Cobb angle\nis customized for spinal curvature. Automatic Cobb angle measurement from X-ray\nimages is crucial for scoliosis screening and diagnosis. However, most existing\nregression-based and segmentation-based methods struggle with inaccurate spine\nrepresentations or mask connectivity and fragmentation issues. Besides,\nlandmark-based methods suffer from insufficient training data and annotations.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel curvature angle estimation\nframework named CurvNet including latent contour representation based contour\ndetection and iterative data engine based image self-generation. Specifically,\nwe propose a parameterized spine contour representation in latent space, which\nenables eigen-spine decomposition and spine contour reconstruction. Latent\ncontour coefficient regression is combined with anchor box classification to\nsolve inaccurate predictions and mask connectivity issues. Moreover, we develop\na data engine with image self-generation, automatic annotation, and automatic\nselection in an iterative manner. By our data engine, we generate a clean\ndataset named Spinal-AI2024 without privacy leaks, which is the largest\nreleased scoliosis X-ray dataset to our knowledge. Extensive experiments on\npublic AASCE2019, our private Spinal2023, and our generated Spinal-AI2024\ndatasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art Cobb angle\nestimation performance.

    "summary": "In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization\ncapabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse\nclass semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively\ndetect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level\ninformation. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel\ncorrespondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering\npixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D\nrepresentation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects\nthe inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose\nPointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing\nexplicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal\nspatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry\ninformation to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To\nsimultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes\nhierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit\nanomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the\nrendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy\ncontrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between\nthe rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.\nFinally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the\ngeneralized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB\ninformation in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in\nZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class\nsemantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for\nimproving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,\nspecifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A\ncritical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the\nintroduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly\nrealized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a\nsignificant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced\nnoise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to\nthe reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin\nof this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To\naddress this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models\n(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,\nCoefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This\nleads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more\nstable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO\nand Dance-GRPO.

    "summary": "Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a\nreference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of\nperforming unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While\ncurrent approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more\nrecent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown\nprogress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes.\" This inherent opacity\nnot only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also\nrestricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end\nretrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning\nchain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal\ninteractions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision\nprocess transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the\nnecessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of\nstructured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,\nreasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this\nstructured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated\nembedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly\ncompetitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and\ndemonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,\nestablishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval\nsystems.",

Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the\ngeneralization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the\nratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics\nof synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)\nstrategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,\nASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but\nalso provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly\nsynthesis",

However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy\ncomputational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates\nand long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most\nexisting training-free methods cause information loss and performance\ndegradation. To overcome this, we propose \\textbf{Memory-Augmented\nReinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates\nstructured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a\n\\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \\textbf{Visual Memory\nRetriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \\textbf{Compression Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a\nteacher to a student model.

    "summary": "With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of\nsatellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the\ncontinuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images\nacross diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully\nexploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source\ndimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances\nreconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple\nobservations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images\nconstrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source\nimages by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data,\nbut typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes\nnoise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration.\nTo address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for\nEnhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion.\nSpecifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF)\nmodule to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a\nMulti-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture\ninformation from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module\nadaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while\ndynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination\nof multiple loss functions.

    "summary": "Albeit the scalable performance of vision transformers (ViTs), the dense\ncomputational costs (training & inference) undermine their position in\nindustrial applications. Post-training quantization (PTQ), tuning ViTs with a\ntiny dataset and running in a low-bit format, well addresses the cost issue but\nunluckily bears more performance drops in lower-bit cases. In this paper, we\nintroduce I&S-ViT, a novel method that regulates the PTQ of ViTs in an\ninclusive and stable fashion. I&S-ViT first identifies two issues in the PTQ of\nViTs: (1) Quantization inefficiency in the prevalent log2 quantizer for\npost-Softmax activations; (2) Rugged and magnified loss landscape in\ncoarse-grained quantization granularity for post-LayerNorm activations. Then,\nI&S-ViT addresses these issues by introducing: (1) A novel shift-uniform-log2\nquantizer (SULQ) that incorporates a shift mechanism followed by uniform\nquantization to achieve both an inclusive domain representation and accurate\ndistribution approximation; (2) A three-stage smooth optimization strategy\n(SOS) that amalgamates the strengths of channel-wise and layer-wise\nquantization to enable stable learning. Comprehensive evaluations across\ndiverse vision tasks validate I&S-ViT' superiority over existing PTQ of ViTs\nmethods, particularly in low-bit scenarios. For instance, I&S-ViT elevates the\nperformance of 3-bit ViT-B by an impressive 50.68%.",

    "summary": "Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast\ncancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying\nabnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse\ndatasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical\nconstraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle\nmOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate\nfull-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in\nrealistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and\nnone have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture\nfine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates\nseparate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level)\ncontexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final model,\nsignificantly aiding the noise removal process. This design enables MAMBO to\ngenerate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly,\nthis approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and\nextended to anomaly segmentation. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist\nvalidation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution,\nand anomaly segmentation, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography\nanalysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.

However, training\nthese architectures from scratch remains resource-intensive (e.g., in terms of\ndata and time). Motivated by this challenge, we explore a cross-architecture\nknowledge transfer paradigm, termed TransMamba, that facilitates the reuse of\nTransformer pre-trained knowledge. We propose a two-stage framework to\naccelerate the training of Mamba-based models, ensuring their effectiveness\nacross both uni-modal and multi-modal tasks. The first stage leverages\npre-trained Transformer models to initialize critical components of the Mamba\narchitecture. To bridge architectural and dimensional gaps, we develop a\nselective weight subcloning strategy and a layered initialization scheme that\nprioritizes the early $n$ layers. Building on this initialization, the second\nstage introduces an adaptive multi-directional knowledge distillation method.\nThis mechanism employs layer-wise adaptive scaling factors to align Mamba\nrepresentations with their Transformer counterparts, while accommodating the\nscanning order variations inherent to multi-modal Mamba architectures. Despite\noperating with a reduced training dataset and a more compact model\narchitecture, TransMamba consistently outperforms baseline approaches across\ndiverse mamba-based backbones (e.g., PlainMamba, Vmamba, ViM and VideoMamba)\nand downstream tasks (e.g., image classification, visual question answering,\ntext-video retrieval and multimodal reasoning).

    "summary": "Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction\nparadigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and\nreconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their\ngeneralization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while\nreconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed\nview transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the\ngeneralization capability across different driving scenes equipped with\ndifferent camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between\nsparse views of the $360^\\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes\nincrease the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To\nhandle these difficulties, we propose \\textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model\nbased on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and\nfeature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we\ndesign a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the\nlearning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different\ncamera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction\naccuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules\nbased on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image\nfeatures to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be\ngeneralized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner.

    "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic\nrendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces\nsevere aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under\nhigh-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as\nflickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian\nprimitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing\n``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this\nfidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded\nregularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D\nGaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is\npyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising\nthe rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to\nlearn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across\ndifferent viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is\ncomplemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a\nphysically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This\nprevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to\nmore stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our\nmethod is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive\nexperiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around\n1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and\nrobustness under demanding 4K rendering.",

Our\nanalysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of\nsimple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the\nparameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP\n(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive\npower by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine\ntransformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving\noriginal image information, and color transformation for emphasizing\ntask-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a\ncritical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data\naugmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly\nimproves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage\npoints on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data\naugmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments\nacross twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model\narchitectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among\nVP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior\nrobustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational\noverhead during inference.",

    "summary": "Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\\circ}$ indoor\npanoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods\nfocus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise\nsensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on\nroom geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through\nlayout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation\nprocess through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our\nframework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders\nfor layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The\nshared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed\nby individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room\nlayout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework\nincorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving\nstrategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed\nroom-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room\nlayout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background\ndepth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives\nfusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation\ndecoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,\nMatterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can\nachieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/emiyaning/RGCNet.",

In scenarios where optimum handwriting\nsamples are available, whether they be in the form of a single line, a\nsentence, or an entire page, writer identification algorithms have demonstrated\nnoteworthy levels of accuracy.

This methodology enables the system to\ncapture a comprehensive representation of the data, encompassing both\nfine-grained details and coarse features across various levels of abstraction.\nThese extracted fragments serve as the training data for the convolutional\nnetwork, enabling it to learn a more robust representation compared to\ntraditional convolution-based networks trained on word images.

    "summary": "Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are\nvaluable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in\npsychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition\nremains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.\nOptical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to\nits effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only\nbetween the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion\ninformation in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first\nintroduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated\nCombined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both\nmicro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in\nrecognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a\nnovel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase\nanalysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules.

Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks\nmainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or\ngeographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail\nto assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video\nand graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and\nemergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning\nbenchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of\nmoving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging\nas it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint\nreasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and\ninference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video\ncontext. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that\neven the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags\nbehind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our\ncomprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of\ncurrent models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by\nan imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in\ntemporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized\ntasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to\ncomprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs.

    "summary": "Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB\nvideos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase\nthe uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first\nframe might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second\nframe. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are\nrobust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,\nthe event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame\nlarge motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining\nlow-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address\nthis challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS\nusing both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between\nthese two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly\noptimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event\nmotion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we\nextract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM\nunsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a\ncertain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association\nmethod to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary\nfoundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion\ndecomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label.

Given recent advances in diffusion models, it is natural for us to\nconsider their potential applicability to document dewarping. However, it is\nfar from straightforward to adopt diffusion models in document dewarping due to\ntheir unfaithful control on highly complex document images (e.g.,\n2000$times$3000 resolution). In this paper, we propose DvD, the first\ngenerative model to tackle document Dewarping via a Diffusion framework.

Baked appearance and shadow\ninformation in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects\nand scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and\nscene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing\nGaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to\nlow efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store\nlighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via\ninterpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x\nspeedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian\nscenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering\nmethods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex\nscenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and\nare viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily\nconcerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the\nchallenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the\nenvironment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360\ndegrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune\na diffusion model to complete the lighting.

    "summary": "Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a\ncritical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to\ninherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches\nleverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to\nhallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from\nSMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and\nreconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel\nframework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative\nmodel for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh\nreconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.\nMultiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles\nwith structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates\ncoarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary\nstrengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation\nframework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative\nmodel and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D\nsynchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D\nmultiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection\nmechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D\nshapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D\nhuman reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method\noutperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,\ndemonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic\nWeighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation\n(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source\nto the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through\nintermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient\nknowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a\ndynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of\nthe source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an\noptimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\\varrho$\n(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific\nlearning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to\ngenerate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for\niterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.\nExperiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the\nCover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.\nAblation studies further validate the critical role of $\\varrho$'s dynamic\nscheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in\nreducing domain bias and improving generalization.

    "summary": "Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with\nnumerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based\nmethods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity\nrelationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior\nperformance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,\nthe strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes\nat the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To\naddress this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel\nweak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by\ntransferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two\nbranches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.\nThrough an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages\nlocal similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,\ninspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel\nmixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,\nfurther enhancing the performance of both branches.

    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse\nmultimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the\nvision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have\nshown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely\npruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs\nefficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel\nmiddle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps\nextracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect\nfine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.\nBased on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain\nboth globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the\n1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial\nlayout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and\nretain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local\nretaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the\nmost important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our\nproposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of\nLLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and\nimprove the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without\nsacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.\nCompared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher\ninference efficiency.",

Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently\nchallenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better\nassess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP\nencounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating\non 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after\nfine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'\nsome domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance\ndeteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present\nCLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware\nrepresentations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while\nstandard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,\nthis can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of\ndomain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead\nhypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective\ndomain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and\nenhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head\nand synthetically generated diverse domain data.

Experiments incorporate auxiliary point\nfeatures including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part\nparsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D\n120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal\naction recognition algorithms.

This is encouraged by the\nproposed Dual-Stream Alignment Loss, which comprises three components:\nrelational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency\nreconstruction losses. Following prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several\ndiverse benchmark datasets: GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We\nfurther demonstrate the effectiveness of each component through extensive\nablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nsignificantly outperforming existing",

Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case\nstudy, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance\nComputing) servers, and Cloud. Using redshift prediction with the AstroMAE\nmodel demonstrated CAI's scalability and efficiency, achieving inference on a\n12.6 GB dataset in only 28 seconds compared to 140.8 seconds on HPC GPUs and\n1793 seconds on HPC CPUs. CAI also achieved significantly higher throughput,\nreaching 18.04 billion bits per second (bps), and maintained near-constant\ninference times as data sizes increased, all at minimal computational cost\n(under $5 per experiment). We also process large-scale data up to 1 TB to show\nCAI's effectiveness at scale. CAI thus provides a highly scalable, accessible,\nand cost-effective inference solution for the astronomy community.

Consequently,\nwhen the scene is rendered from novel camera views, existing single image to 3D\nreconstruction methods render incoherent and blurry views. This problem is\nexacerbated when the unseen regions are far away from the input camera. In this\nwork, we address these inherent limitations in existing single image-to-3D\nscene feedforward networks. To alleviate the poor performance due to\ninsufficient information beyond the input image's view, we leverage a strong\ngenerative prior in the form of a pre-trained latent video diffusion model, for\niterative refinement of a coarse scene represented by optimizable Gaussian\nparameters. To ensure that the style and texture of the generated images align\nwith that of the input image, we incorporate on-the-fly Fourier-style transfer\nbetween the generated images and the input image. Additionally, we design a\nsemantic uncertainty quantification module that calculates the per-pixel\nentropy and yields uncertainty maps used to guide the refinement process from\nthe most confident pixels while discarding the remaining highly uncertain ones.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on real-world scene datasets, including\nin-domain RealEstate-10K and out-of-domain KITTI-v2, showing that our approach\ncan provide more realistic and high-fidelity novel view synthesis results\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in\nmulti-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering\n(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual\ncontext simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained\nmodels are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected\nacross several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or\nsensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.\nRecently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of\nprivate data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the\nvisual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition\nto the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language\nmodels, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for\noutput generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to\nformulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and\nefficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive\nmodel finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning\ninformation in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find\nthat the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain\nreference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs\nbetter or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the\npre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a\npractical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.",

    "summary": "We present a neural radiance field (NeRF) based large-scale reconstruction\nsystem that fuses lidar and vision data to generate high-quality\nreconstructions that are geometrically accurate and capture photorealistic\ntexture. Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to\nincorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the\ndepth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform\ntexture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. A key\ncontribution of this work is a novel method to quantify the epistemic\nuncertainty of the lidar-visual NeRF reconstruction by estimating the spatial\nvariance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor\nobservations from the cameras and lidar. This provides a principled approach to\nevaluate the contribution of each sensor modality to the final reconstruction.\nIn this way, reconstructions that are uncertain (due to e.g. uniform visual\ntexture, limited observation viewpoints, or little lidar coverage) can be\nidentified and removed. Our system is integrated with a real-time lidar SLAM\nsystem which is used to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction\nprocedure. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which\nis essential for the lidar depth loss. The refined SLAM trajectory can then be\ndivided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible\nimages together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual\nreconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Our uncertainty estimation is\nparticularly effective when merging submaps as their boundaries often contain\nartefacts due to limited observations.

(i) While the emphasis is on\nsubject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for\nproducing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely\nunexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a\nsingle model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,\nhowever, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the\nbetter video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To\naddress these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of\nsystematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with\n45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V\nmodels. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background\nscene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene\nconsistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion\nsmoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric\nshows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:\nocclusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.\nBuilding on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages\nobject error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our\nsecond innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that\ntracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object\nfidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve\nstronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the\nmodel level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval\nas a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic\ncamera motion.",

    "title": "Context Matters: Learning Global Semantics via Object-Centric\n  Representation",
    "summary": "Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly\ndesirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.\nHowever, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.\nIn this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and\ncontextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and\nsuch a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.\nSpecifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are\ninherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a\nrealistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which\ninevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to\ndirectly model \"object\" as the visual equivalence of \"word,\" pushing the model\nto learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate\nour hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach\ncan be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random\npatches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations\nreveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a\nreal-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned\nwithout it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual\nquestion answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning\nand contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our\nstudy highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a\nplausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.\nCode and model will be publicly released.

    "summary": "Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined\nrelative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\\to$$Y$. Is it possible to\nidentify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally\nnonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that\nmakes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich\na linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A\ng_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly\ndefined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this\nkind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of\nlinear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,\napplicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of\ntwo Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage\nthis property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our\narchitecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.\nWe further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)\non networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to\ndemonstrate modular style transfer.",

However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)\nfine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable\nlikelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level\nlikelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this\napproach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in\nsequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a\nsurrogate.

    "summary": "Real-world graph datasets often consist of mixtures of populations, where\ngraphs are generated from multiple distinct underlying distributions. However,\nmodern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning\n(GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture\nstructure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models\ndata as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models\nrepresented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph\nmoments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This\nenables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct\ngenerative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph\nlearning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data\naugmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided\nby the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2)\nFor GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally,\nby introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL)\nimproves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other\nmodels. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound\nshowing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have\nsimilar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised\nlearning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average\nrank across eight datasets.

LLM inference is composed of two phases with\ndistinct characteristics: a compute-bound prefill phase followed by a\nmemory-bound decode phase. To efficiently serve LLMs, prior work proposes\nprefill-decode disaggregation to run each phase on separate hardware. However,\nexisting hardware poorly matches the different requirements of each phase.\nCurrent datacenter GPUs and TPUs follow a more-is-better design philosophy that\nmaximizes compute and memory resources, causing memory bandwidth\nunderutilization in the prefill phase and compute underutilization in the\ndecode phase. Such underutilization directly translates into increased serving\ncosts.\n  This paper proposes SPAD (Specialized Prefill and Decode hardware), adopting\na less-is-more methodology to design specialized chips tailored to the distinct\ncharacteristics of prefill and decode phases. The proposed Prefill Chips have\nlarger systolic arrays and use cost-effective GDDR memory, whereas the proposed\nDecode Chips retain high memory bandwidth but reduce compute capacity. Compared\nto modeled H100s, simulations show that the proposed Prefill Chips deliver 8%\nhigher prefill performance on average at 52% lower hardware cost, while the\nproposed Decode Chips achieve 97% of the decode performance with 28% lower TDP.\n  End-to-end simulations on production traces show that SPAD reduces hardware\ncost by 19%-41% and TDP by 2%-17% compared to modeled baseline clusters while\noffering the same performance. Even when models and workloads change, SPAD can\nreallocate either type of chip to run either phase and still achieve 11%-43%\nlower hardware costs, demonstrating the longevity of the SPAD design.",

Gaussian noise to the inhomogeneous case, where the noise has a variance\nprofile. In particular, for the special case where the variance profile has a\nblock structure, a series of results identified an effective spectral algorithm\nfor detecting and estimating the signal, identified the threshold signal\nstrength required for that algorithm to succeed, and proved\ninformation-theoretic lower bounds that, for some special signal distributions,\nmatch the above threshold. We complement these results by studying the\ncomputational optimality of this spectral algorithm. Namely, we show that, for\na much broader range of signal distributions, whenever the spectral algorithm\ncannot detect a low-rank signal, then neither can any low-degree polynomial\nalgorithm. This gives the first evidence for a computational hardness\nconjecture of Guionnet, Ko, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\\'a (2023). With similar\ntechniques, we also prove sharp information-theoretic lower bounds for a class\nof signal distributions not treated by prior work.

    "summary": "Graph condensation reduces the size of large graphs while preserving\nperformance, addressing the scalability challenges of Graph Neural Networks\ncaused by computational inefficiencies on large datasets. Existing methods\noften rely on bi-level optimization, requiring extensive GNN training and\nlimiting their scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph\nCondensation via Gaussian Process (GCGP), a novel and computationally efficient\napproach to graph condensation. GCGP utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP), with the\ncondensed graph serving as observations, to estimate the posterior distribution\nof predictions. This approach eliminates the need for the iterative and\nresource-intensive training typically required by GNNs. To enhance the\ncapability of the GCGP in capturing dependencies between function values, we\nderive a specialized covariance function that incorporates structural\ninformation. This covariance function broadens the receptive field of input\nnodes by local neighborhood aggregation, thereby facilitating the\nrepresentation of intricate dependencies within the nodes. To address the\nchallenge of optimizing binary structural information in condensed graphs,\nConcrete random variables are utilized to approximate the binary adjacency\nmatrix in a continuous counterpart. This relaxation process allows the\nadjacency matrix to be represented in a differentiable form, enabling the\napplication of gradient-based optimization techniques to discrete graph\nstructures. Experimental results show that the proposed GCGP method efficiently\ncondenses large-scale graph data while preserving predictive performance,\naddressing the scalability and efficiency challenges.

Such\njoin conditions can be evaluated using large language models (LLMs) that solve\nnovel tasks without task-specific training.\n  Currently, many semantic query processing engines implement semantic joins\nvia nested loops, invoking the LLM to evaluate the join condition on row pairs.\nInstead, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, inspired by the block nested\nloops join operator implementation in traditional database systems. The\nproposed algorithm integrates batches of rows from both input tables into a\nsingle prompt. The goal of the LLM invocation is to identify all matching row\npairs in the current input. The paper introduces formulas that can be used to\noptimize the size of the row batches, taking into account constraints on the\nsize of the LLM context window (limiting both input and output size). An\nadaptive variant of the proposed algorithm refers to cases in which the size of\nthe output is difficult to estimate.

To do\nthis, we create a new combinatorial dimension that is based off of the\nNatarajan Dimension \\citep{natarajan1989learning} and we show that a hypothesis\nclass is learnable in our setting if and only if this Generalized Natarajan\nDimension is finite.

    "title": "Phantora: Maximizing Code Reuse in Simulation-based Machine Learning\n  System Performance Estimation",
    "summary": "Modern machine learning (ML) training workloads place substantial demands on\nboth computational and communication resources. Consequently, accurate\nperformance estimation has become increasingly critical for guiding system\ndesign decisions, such as the selection of parallelization strategies, cluster\nconfigurations, and hardware provisioning. Existing simulation-based\nperformance estimation requires reimplementing the ML framework in a simulator,\nwhich demands significant manual effort and is hard to maintain as ML\nframeworks evolve rapidly.\n  This paper introduces Phantora, a hybrid GPU cluster simulator designed for\nperformance estimation of ML training workloads. Phantora executes unmodified\nML frameworks as is within a distributed, containerized environment. Each\ncontainer emulates the behavior of a GPU server in a large-scale cluster, while\nPhantora intercepts and simulates GPU- and communication-related operations to\nprovide high-fidelity performance estimation. We call this approach hybrid\nsimulation of ML systems, in contrast to traditional methods that simulate\nstatic workloads. The primary advantage of hybrid simulation is that it allows\ndirect reuse of ML framework source code in simulation, avoiding the need for\nreimplementation. Our evaluation shows that Phantora provides accuracy\ncomparable to static workload simulation while supporting three\nstate-of-the-art LLM training frameworks out-of-the-box. In addition, Phantora\noperates on a single GPU, eliminating the need for the resource-intensive trace\ncollection and workload extraction steps required by traditional trace-based\nsimulators. Phantora is open-sourced at https://github.com/QDelta/Phantora.",

    "summary": "Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network\ntraining, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar\ngradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a\ndiversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an\napproximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously\noverlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally\nnon-gradient \"curl\"-like components while still being able to effectively\noptimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with\ninhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,\nresulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any\nobjective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze\nfeedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher\nframework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons\nexhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of\nthe original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to\ngradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the\nsolution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of\nstability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In\nother cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to\ngradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by\ntemporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures\ncapable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an\nimportant counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in\nneural networks.",

These\nsolutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and\ncritical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the\nopacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack\nof transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and\nverifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to\ncomprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks.\n  To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce\nPROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations\nusing an interpretable surrogate model.

Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based\nhypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions\ngenerated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled\nsamples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE\nparametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can\nhandle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions\nwith varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary\nconditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot\naccuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming\nU-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we\nintroduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the\ngenerated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a\n\"delta\" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an\nensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six\nbenchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,\nwhile retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the\nfine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge\nfaster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and\nReptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the\nremaining two.

Unfortunately, since\nmodels are usually trained solely based on samples from the original\n(unshifted) distribution, this performative shift may lead to decreased\ntest-time performance. In this paper, we study the question of whether and when\nperformative binary classification problems are learnable, via the lens of the\nclassic PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning framework. We motivate\nseveral performative scenarios, accounting in particular for linear shifts in\nthe label distribution, as well as for more general changes in both the labels\nand the features. We construct a performative empirical risk function, which\ndepends only on data from the original distribution and on the type\nperformative effect, and is yet an unbiased estimate of the true risk of a\nclassifier on the shifted distribution. Minimizing this notion of performative\nrisk allows us to show that any PAC-learnable hypothesis space in the standard\nbinary classification setting remains PAC-learnable for the considered\nperformative scenarios.

    "summary": "Federated learning (FL), integrating group fairness mechanisms, allows\nmultiple clients to collaboratively train a global model that makes unbiased\ndecisions for different populations grouped by sensitive attributes (e.g.,\ngender and race). Due to its distributed nature, previous studies have\ndemonstrated that FL systems are vulnerable to model poisoning attacks.\nHowever, these studies primarily focus on perturbing accuracy, leaving a\ncritical question unexplored: Can an attacker bypass the group fairness\nmechanisms in FL and manipulate the global model to be biased? The motivations\nfor such an attack vary; an attacker might seek higher accuracy, yet fairness\nconsiderations typically limit the accuracy of the global model or aim to cause\nethical disruption. To address this question, we design a novel form of attack\nin FL, termed Profit-driven Fairness Attack (PFAttack), which aims not to\ndegrade global model accuracy but to bypass fairness mechanisms. Our\nfundamental insight is that group fairness seeks to weaken the dependence of\noutputs on input attributes related to sensitive information. In the proposed\nPFAttack, an attacker can recover this dependence through local fine-tuning\nacross various sensitive groups, thereby creating a biased yet\naccuracy-preserving malicious model and injecting it into FL through model\nreplacement. Compared to attacks targeting accuracy, PFAttack is more stealthy.\nThe malicious model in PFAttack exhibits subtle parameter variations relative\nto the original global model, making it robust against detection and filtering\nby Byzantine-resilient aggregations. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets are conducted for four fair FL frameworks and three\nByzantine-resilient aggregations against model poisoning, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and stealth of PFAttack in bypassing group fairness mechanisms in\nFL.",

    "summary": "Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the\nquadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence\nparallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing\nthe query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q\ntensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather\ncommunication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,\nrestricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the\nmismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the\nAlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is\ncomposed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a\nvery limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.\n  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we\nidentify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple\northogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without\ninterference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather\nprimitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled\ndata transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a\ntopology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the\ncommunication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and\nprimitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and\nmulti-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate\nthat TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these\nmodern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring\nAttention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention.

    "summary": "Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention,\nagricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP)\nmethods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are\ncomputationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical\ndata. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in\nweather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and\nregional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event\npredictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework\n(OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system\nperspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure\nand densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We\nintroduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply\nintegrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting.\nFor high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method\nto mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that\nOneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and\nshort-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.\nCodes link https://github.com/YuanGao-YG/OneForecast.",

    "summary": "Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in\nmany biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling\nby their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional\ntoken dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,\nbidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and\nscalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR\ngeneration by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from\nnon-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with\ntwo decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological\nfeatures, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging\nthese bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables\nthe AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,\nenriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training\nstrategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder\ngradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding\nnine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model\nsubstantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR\nstability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior\nperformance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological\nsequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for\naugmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex\nsequence generation.

    "summary": "Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that\ngeneralize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from\nmultiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address\nprivacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically\nassume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the\nnumber of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,\nleading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose\nGALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key\ncomponents: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that\nefficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic\ncomputation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting\nstrategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with\nthe target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable\ntraining across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance\nin high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising\n18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts.

Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this\nissue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control\nunresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance\nunclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which\neliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy\ngradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through\ntemperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as\nregularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as\nregularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting\noptimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)\nstabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in\nGRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves\nthen declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,\nexploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a\nbroader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE\nregularizers.",

However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus\non semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models\noften generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no\ncorresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination\nand identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the\nprevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current\nmetrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation\nframework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event\ndetectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and\nseverity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and\nIH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose\nPosterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that\nmitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial\naudio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio\nafter masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments\non several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models\nsuffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence\nand duration of hallucinations by over 50\\% on average, without degrading, and\nin some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and\ntemporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define,\nsystematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination,\npaving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.",

Modern serving systems adopt stall-free\nscheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt\nprocessing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing\ndecode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs\nsubstantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert\nweight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy\nconsumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats\ntransformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically\npartitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill\nand decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding\nwhile eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip\nbandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and\nper-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill\nconsistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,\nreducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free\ndecoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a\nnew operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in\nco-located environments.",

    "summary": "Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they\ninevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which\namplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy\nrisks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the\nrelease of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership\ninference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership\nInference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled\ninformation-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method\nconsistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved\ncomputational efficiency.\n  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating\nsequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.\nWe propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:\ntoken-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA\ncan pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby\nlocalizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while\nachieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope\nrethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as\nexact unlearning.",

    "title": "Do We Really Need Permutations? Impact of Width Expansion on Linear Mode\n  Connectivity",
    "summary": "Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two\nindependently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves\nthe input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss\nlinear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear\nmode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have\nreported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search\nbut also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\\times$ width multiplier for\nResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width\nensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance\nof finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,\neven without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for\nachieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further\nexplain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.\nSpecifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity\n(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be\nrepresented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the\ncorresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's\noutput matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates\nLMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening\nthe model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in\nprior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving\nlinear mode connectivity.",

    "title": "Unsupervised Radio Map Construction in Mixed LoS/NLoS Indoor\n  Environments",
    "summary": "Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and\nlocalization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically\nrequire costly calibration pro- cesses to collect location-labeled channel\nstate information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data\ncollection trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence,\neliminating the need for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a\nhidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel\npropagation matrix, while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in\nthe trajectory. The primary challenges involve modeling the complex\nrelationship between channel propagation in multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) networks and geographical locations, and addressing both line-of-sight\n(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose\nan HMM-based framework that jointly characterizes the conditional propagation\nmodel and the evolution of the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel\npropagation in MIMO networks is modeled separately in terms of power, delay,\nand angle, with distinct models for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user\ntrajectory is modeled using a Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel\npropagation, the mobility model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized\nsimultaneously. Experimental validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal\nFrequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform\nlinear arrays (ULA) configuration demonstrates that the proposed method\nachieves an average localization accuracy of 0.65 meters in an indoor\nenvironment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions. Moreover, the constructed\nradio map enables localization with a reduced error compared to conventional\nsupervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine\n(SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).",

The paper next focuses on the\nformalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation\nthat enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk\ncertificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.\nThe last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable\nobjectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are\ncomplemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.\nIn fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on\nCIFAR-10 for neural networks.",

    "summary": "Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power\nalternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),\nalthough performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance\nof SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or\nintroduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be\nnaturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient\nself-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and\nevaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the\nweak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient\nself-distillation schemes: (1) \\textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the\nstronger \"teacher\" guides the weaker \"student\", effectively improving overall\nperformance. (2) \\textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the \"teacher\",\ndistilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding\nsignificant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible\nimplementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.\nExperiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and\noverall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also\nenhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This\ningeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into\nhow to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.",

    "summary": "Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving\ncollaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to\nByzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.\nExisting Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor\nscreening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete\nhigh-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,\ncreating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent\ndeployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that\ndecouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based\nneighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to\n$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \\ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity\ncomparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,\nreducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +\nd|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \\le |N_i|$ is the\naccepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both\nstrongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression\npreserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where\napproximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\\epsilon))$ factor in the effective\nthreshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,\nnetwork topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains\nidentical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation\ntime by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering\neffectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality\nand network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based\ncompression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.",

    "summary": "The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance\nbetween a distribution pair is at least $\\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the\nsame for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when\nassessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.",

The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique\nand infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then\nguides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and\naccurate SEM image filtering pipeline.

Latent drivers,\nsuch as atmospheric processes, play a critical role in temporal dynamics, while\ndirect causal influences also exist among geographically proximate observed\nvariables. Traditional Causal Representation Learning (CRL) typically focuses\non latent factors but overlooks such observable-to-observable causal relations,\nlimiting its applicability to climate analysis. In this paper, we introduce a\nunified framework that jointly uncovers (i) causal relations among observed\nvariables and (ii) latent driving forces together with their interactions. We\nestablish conditions under which both the hidden dynamic processes and the\ncausal structure among observed variables are simultaneously identifiable from\ntime-series data. Remarkably, our guarantees hold even in the nonparametric\nsetting, leveraging contextual information to recover latent variables and\ncausal relations. Building on these insights, we propose CaDRe (Causal\nDiscovery and Representation learning), a time-series generative model with\nstructural constraints that integrates CRL and causal discovery. Experiments on\nsynthetic datasets validate our theoretical results. On real-world climate\ndatasets, CaDRe not only delivers competitive forecasting accuracy but also\nrecovers visualized causal graphs aligned with domain expertise, thereby\noffering interpretable insights into climate systems.",

    "title": "Little By Little: Continual Learning via Self-Activated Sparse\n  Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive Learning",
    "summary": "Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by\ncatastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and\nfreezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and\nambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As\nmore experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating\nforgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approaches\nwith self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple\nlow-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-one\ncomponents, each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained\nrank-one expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To\navoid ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-one expert can infer its own\nrelevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning\nand activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per\ninput.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering web-based\napplications, whose effectiveness relies on fine-tuning with large-scale\ninstruction data. However, such data often contains valuable or sensitive\ninformation that limits its public sharing among business organizations.\nFederated learning (FL) enables collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs without\naccessing raw data. Existing approaches to federated LLM fine-tuning usually\nadopt a uniform model architecture, making it challenging to fit highly\nheterogeneous client-side data in varying domains and tasks, e.g., hospitals\nand financial institutions conducting federated fine-tuning may require\ndifferent LLM architectures due to the distinct nature of their domains and\ntasks. To address this, we propose FedAMoLE, a lightweight personalized FL\nframework that enables data-driven heterogeneous model architectures. It\nfeatures a heterogeneous mixture of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) experts module\nto aggregate architecturally heterogeneous models and a reverse selection-based\nexpert assignment strategy to tailor model architectures for each client based\non data distributions.

    "summary": "Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the\ngeneralization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the\nlandscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.\nUnfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the\ngeneralization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap\nbetween the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,\ni.e., \\textit{R\\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\\'enyi\nentropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss\nHessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \\textit{uniform}\n(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping\nthe sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the\n\\textit{R\\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of\nthe eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller\nthe (R\\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between\ngeneralization and (R\\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization\nbounds in terms of R\\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the\nreparametrization invariance property of R\\'enyi sharpness, as well as the\ntrick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.\nFurthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong\ncorrelation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\\'enyi\nsharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\\'enyi\nSharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\\'enyi Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware\nminimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our\nproposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\\%, compared against the\nclassical SAM method.",

To\nthis end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook\nthat systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side\nfederated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain\nCollaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more\nsemantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance\ndomain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client\ncontributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks\nduring the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain\ndiversity.

    "summary": "Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important\nfor many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and\npandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing\nprivacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.\nThe recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new\nopportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic\ndata that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy\nprotection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains\nchallenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and\nthe complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain\nhuman mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage\ncoarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.\nIn the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular\nlatent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then\ndesign a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an\nefficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In\nthe second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq\narchitecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder\nand a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN\ntrajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling\nsemantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty.

TCP couples a modern quantile forecaster with a split-conformal\ncalibration layer on a rolling window and, in its TCP-RM variant, augments the\nconformal threshold with a single online Robbins-Monro (RM) offset to steer\ncoverage toward a target level in real time. We benchmark TCP against GARCH,\nHistorical Simulation, and a rolling Quantile Regression (QR) baseline across\nequities (S&P 500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Three\nresults are consistent across assets. First, rolling QR yields the sharpest\nintervals but is materially under-calibrated (e.g., S&P 500: 83.2% vs. 95%\ntarget). Second, TCP (and TCP-RM) achieves near-nominal coverage across assets,\nwith intervals that are wider than Historical Simulation in this evaluation\n(e.g., S&P 500: 5.21 vs. 5.06). Third, the RM update changes calibration and\nwidth only marginally at our default hyperparameters.

In this paper, we investigate this\nphenomenon within a novel framework, where generative models are iteratively\ntrained on a combination of newly collected real data and synthetic data from\nthe previous training step. To develop an optimal training strategy for\nintegrating real and synthetic data, we evaluate the performance of a weighted\ntraining scheme in various scenarios, including Gaussian distribution\nestimation, generalized linear models, and nonparametric estimation. We\ntheoretically characterize the impact of the mixing proportion and weighting\nscheme of synthetic data on the final model's performance. Our key finding is\nthat, across different settings, the optimal weighting scheme under different\nproportions of synthetic data asymptotically follows a unified expression,\nrevealing a fundamental trade-off between leveraging synthetic data and model\nperformance. In some cases, the optimal weight assigned to real data\ncorresponds to the reciprocal of the golden ratio.

    "title": "Stochastic Interpolants: A Unifying Framework for Flows and Diffusions",
    "summary": "A class of generative models that unifies flow-based and diffusion-based\nmethods is introduced. These models extend the framework proposed in Albergo\nand Vanden-Eijnden (2023), enabling the use of a broad class of continuous-time\nstochastic processes called stochastic interpolants to bridge any two\nprobability density functions exactly in finite time. These interpolants are\nbuilt by combining data from the two prescribed densities with an additional\nlatent variable that shapes the bridge in a flexible way. The time-dependent\ndensity function of the interpolant is shown to satisfy a transport equation as\nwell as a family of forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable\ndiffusion coefficient. Upon consideration of the time evolution of an\nindividual sample, this viewpoint leads to both deterministic and stochastic\ngenerative models based on probability flow equations or stochastic\ndifferential equations with an adjustable level of noise. The drift\ncoefficients entering these models are time-dependent velocity fields\ncharacterized as the unique minimizers of simple quadratic objective functions,\none of which is a new objective for the score. We show that minimization of\nthese quadratic objectives leads to control of the likelihood for generative\nmodels built upon stochastic dynamics, while likelihood control for\ndeterministic dynamics is more stringent. We also construct estimators for the\nlikelihood and the cross entropy of interpolant-based generative models, and we\ndiscuss connections with other methods such as score-based diffusion models,\nstochastic localization, probabilistic denoising, and rectifying flows. In\naddition, we demonstrate that stochastic interpolants recover the Schr\\\"odinger\nbridge between the two target densities when explicitly optimizing over the\ninterpolant. Finally, algorithmic aspects are discussed and the approach is\nillustrated on numerical examples.",

This study addresses\nthese issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental\nsynthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness\nagainst progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel\ninputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,\nwe evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed\nAttention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,\ntrained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily\nfrom deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and\ncomputational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while\ntransformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit\nsignificant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this\nas a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model\nachieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while\ndemonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for\nenhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more\nefficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing\npractical onboard anomaly detection systems.",

The recently proposed\nHashing-based Efficient Point Transformer (HEPT) offers a theoretically\nguaranteed near-linear complexity for large point cloud processing via\nlocality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in attention computations; however, its\nevaluations have largely focused on embedding quality, and the object\ncondensation pipeline on which HEPT relies requires a post-hoc clustering step\n(e.g., DBScan) that can dominate runtime.

First, we present a unified, fair evaluation of physics tracking\nperformance for HEPT and a representative GNN-based pipeline under the same\ndataset and metrics. Second, we introduce HEPTv2 by extending HEPT with a\nlightweight decoder that eliminates the clustering stage and directly predicts\ntrack assignments. This modification preserves HEPT's regular,\nhardware-friendly computations while enabling ultra-fast end-to-end inference.\nOn the TrackML dataset, optimized HEPTv2 achieves approximately 28 ms per event\non an A100 while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but\ntheir actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a\nresult, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators\nor simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,\nand routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with\nboth reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external\nto the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language\nby internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the\nvocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but\nmay trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.\nFrom there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive\nfeedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a\nresult. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new\nenvironments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with\ncounterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions\nand contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with\nvocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based\nmulti-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves\nperfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm\ncompetitive with classical designs.",

It\nis known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale\ntraining of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding\nthe role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width\nasymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with\nthe mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram\nthat exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative\nmagnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we\nfind that the well-studied \"penalty\" effect of dropout only persists in the\nlimit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\\text{width})$. For\nlarger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is\nequivalent to a \"random geometry\" technique, where the gradients are thinned\nrandomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this\nasymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where\nthe neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks\n(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the\nphases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in\ndistribution-space.

    "summary": "We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin\n(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a\nfull digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map\nlearning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of\ntrajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This\nrenders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational\nprocess. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and\nanalyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the\nfull DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After\nintroducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction\nand predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\nexample: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this\nproblem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs\nare compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit\nknowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs\nyield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing\nfull flow simulations.",

    "summary": "We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that\nconnections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in\nreal-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of\ngroups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair\ntreatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and\nindividual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level\ndefinitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we\nprovide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral\ndomain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an\noptimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from\nstationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many\nexisting ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of\ngraph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly\nencourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus\nmore flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding\na conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our\nanalysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.\nWe evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate\nits effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of\nFairSpecTemp.",

    "summary": "As end-user device capability increases and demand for intelligent services\nat the Internet's edge rise, distributed learning has emerged as a key enabling\ntechnology. Existing approaches like federated learning (FL) and decentralized\nFL (DFL) enable distributed learning among clients, while gossip learning (GL)\napproaches have emerged to address the potential challenges in\nresource-constrained, connectivity-challenged infrastructure-less environments.\nHowever, most distributed learning approaches assume largely homogeneous data\ndistributions and may not consider or exploit the heterogeneity of clients and\ntheir underlying data distributions. This paper introduces Chisme, a novel\nfully decentralized distributed learning algorithm designed to address the\nchallenges of implementing robust intelligence in network edge contexts\ncharacterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and\nsparse network infrastructure. Chisme leverages cosine similarity-based data\naffinity heuristics calculated from received model exchanges to inform how much\ninfluence received models have when merging into the local model. By doing so,\nit facilitates stronger merging influence between clients with more similar\nmodel learning progressions, enabling clients to strategically balance between\nbroader collaboration to build more general knowledge and more selective\ncollaboration to build specific knowledge. We evaluate Chisme against\ncontemporary approaches using image recognition and time-series prediction\nscenarios while considering different network connectivity conditions,\nrepresentative of real-world distributed intelligent systems.

To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for\nsystematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of\nplanner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our\nbenchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and\nwidely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak\nplanner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak\nexecutor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a\nmemory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)\nthere exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)\nattacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the\nsystem.

However, learned\nbehaviors like attention sinks, where the first token receives the most\nattention despite limited semantic importance, suggest some heads may be\ninactive, and point to a significant source of computational redundancy. To\nanalyze this phenomenon, we propose a taxonomy of 13 score functions that\nmeasure different ways a head can be inactive. Thresholding these scores allows\nus to analyze different sets of potentially inactive attention heads. We\nevaluate whether identified heads are inactive through model interventions,\nfinding that more than 12% of attention heads are inactive on average, and can\nbe ablated in specific contexts while maintaining MMLU accuracy to within 1% of\nthe pretrained LLM. Across 3 model families, our score functions that measure\nthe average norm of a head's output consistently identify inactive heads that\nwould not have been found by score functions that rely solely on attention\nweights. We establish that relying on a score function that measures a first\ntoken attention sink would underestimate the prevalence of inactive heads,\nfailing to identify more than 7% of inactive heads on average.

We\nformulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy\nconsumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task\noffloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the\nQ-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task\noffloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications\nand system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show\nhow varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the\noverall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average\nenergy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.",

    "summary": "When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with\nspecific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,\nthe search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating\nthe properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this\nwork, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to\nmechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine\nlearning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials\ndesign. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training\ndata (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random\nsampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might\nsynthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of\nconvenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a\nsurrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical\nsupervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor\ncompletion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and\nXGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\\% increased\n$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a\nuniformly random sampling of the entire search space.",

Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of\nuncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent\nof uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model\nand distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty\nquantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic\nforecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In\nparticular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment\nthem with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal\nprediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the\nLASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile\nregression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional\nheteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of\nperformance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms\nof probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification\nmethod. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data\nand model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting.\nUncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal\nprediction.

Selecting the right LLM for each query\nis fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices\nfluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are\ntrained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks\nin deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We\nbridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach\nthat trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while\nsupporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the\nperformance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a\ncontextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method\nsimulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing\ndecisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline\nsupervision.

    "summary": "Utilizing the intrinsic history-dependence and nonlinearity of hardware,\nphysical reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic approach to encode\ntime-series data for in-sensor computing. The accuracy of this encoding\ncritically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is\noften limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation\nconditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian\noptimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed\nAl2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal\nencoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree\nof separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally,\nwe show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide\noptimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost.\nSpecifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of\na moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is\nmore accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the\n4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit\noptimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive\nExplanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the\nmost influential parameters in achieving higher state separation.

While previous\nmethods achieve excellent results on manifold meshes by using the quadric error\nmetric, they struggle to produce high-quality outputs for meshes in the wild,\nwhich typically contain non-manifold elements and multiple connected\ncomponents. In this work, we propose a method for simplifying these wild\ntextured triangle meshes. We formulate mesh simplification as a problem of\ndecimating simplicial 2-complexes to handle multiple non-manifold mesh\ncomponents collectively. Building on the success of quadric error\nsimplification, we iteratively collapse 1-simplices (vertex pairs). Our\napproach employs a modified quadric error that converges to the original\nquadric error metric for watertight manifold meshes, while significantly\nimproving the results on wild meshes. For textures, instead of following\nexisting strategies to preserve UVs, we adopt a novel perspective which focuses\non computing mesh correspondences throughout the decimation, independent of the\nUV layout. This combination yields a textured mesh simplification system that\nis capable of handling arbitrary triangle meshes, achieving to high-quality\nresults on wild inputs without sacrificing the excellent performance on clean\ninputs. Our method guarantees to avoid common problems in textured mesh\nsimplification, including the prevalent problem of texture bleeding.

    "title": "Differentiable Variable Fonts",
    "summary": "Editing and animating text appearance for graphic designs, commercials, etc.\nremain highly skilled tasks requiring detailed, hands on efforts from artists.\nAutomating these manual workflows requires balancing the competing goals of\nmaintaining legibility and aesthetics of text, while enabling creative\nexpression. Variable fonts, recent parametric extensions to traditional fonts,\noffer the promise of new ways to ease and automate typographic design and\nanimation. Variable fonts provide custom constructed parameters along which\nfonts can be smoothly varied. These parameterizations could then potentially\nserve as high value continuous design spaces, opening the door to automated\ndesign optimization tools. However, currently variable fonts are underutilized\nin creative applications, because artists so far still need to manually tune\nfont parameters. Our work opens the door to intuitive and automated font design\nand animation workflows with differentiable variable fonts. To do so we distill\nthe current variable font specification to a compact mathematical formulation\nthat differentiably connects the highly non linear, non invertible mapping of\nvariable font parameters to the underlying vector graphics representing the\ntext. This enables us to construct a differentiable framework, with respect to\nvariable font parameters, allowing us to perform gradient based optimization of\nenergies defined on vector graphics control points, and on target rasterized\nimages. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with four applications:\ndirect shape manipulation, overlap aware modeling, physics based text\nanimation, and automated font design optimization. Our work now enables\nleveraging the carefully designed affordances of variable fonts with\ndifferentiability to use modern design optimization technologies, opening new\npossibilities for easy and intuitive typographic design workflows.",

While prior work has\nexplored handheld paradigms, their rod-based mechanical structures remain rigid\nand unintuitive, providing limited tactile feedback and posing challenges for\nhuman operators. Motivated by the dexterity and force feedback of human motion,\nwe propose FreeTacMan, a human-centric and robot-free data collection system\nfor accurate and efficient robot manipulation. Concretely, we design a wearable\ngripper with dual visuo-tactile sensors for data collection, which can be worn\nby human fingers for intuitive control. A high-precision optical tracking\nsystem is introduced to capture end-effector poses while synchronizing visual\nand tactile feedback simultaneously. We leverage FreeTacMan to collect a\nlarge-scale multimodal dataset, comprising over 3000k paired visual-tactile\nimages with end-effector poses, 10k demonstration trajectories across 50\ndiverse contact-rich manipulation tasks. FreeTacMan achieves multiple\nimprovements in data collection performance compared to prior works, and\nenables effective policy learning for contact-rich manipulation tasks with\nself-collected dataset.

This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory\ncoherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.\nCrucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation\npolicy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and\nobjects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale,\ngeneral-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and\nvisual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen.

Experiments show that, while existing\nMLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average\nimprovement of 19.75% in planning performance. Our work provides both an\nessential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied\nintelligence in humanoid robotics.

    "summary": "Underwater environments present unique challenges for robotic operation,\nincluding complex hydrodynamics, limited visibility, and constrained\ncommunication. Although data-driven approaches have advanced embodied\nintelligence in terrestrial robots and enabled task-specific autonomous\nunderwater robots, developing underwater intelligence capable of autonomously\nperforming multiple tasks remains highly challenging, as large-scale,\nhigh-quality underwater datasets are still scarce. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots. USIM comprises over\n561K frames from 1,852 trajectories, totaling approximately 15.6 hours of\nBlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 diverse scenarios, ranging from\nvisual navigation to mobile manipulation. Building upon this dataset, we\npropose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates\nbinocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and\nfurther incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement\nmodule (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across\ntasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking,\nthe framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile\nmanipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared\nwith baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. USIM and U0 show that\nVLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotic applications,\nproviding a foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task\nautonomy, and the practical realization of intelligent general underwater\nrobots.",

    "summary": "Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern\nbecause they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures\naffect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or\nsoftware components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection\nstudies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module,\nresulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate\ninto unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by\nreframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort\nan AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since\nhallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables\nanalysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how\ntheir faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we\npropose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework\nthat induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source\nsimulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations\nwere injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic.\nThe results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of\neach hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations,\nsuch as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of\ncollision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress\nthe AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated,\ncomponent agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and\naccelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and\ncomponents. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the\nfoundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.",

    "summary": "We address the challenge of enabling bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain\nby developing probabilistically safe planning and control strategies that\nensure dynamic feasibility and centroidal robustness under terrain uncertainty.\nSpecifically, we propose a high-level Model Predictive Control (MPC) navigation\nframework for a bipedal robot with a specified confidence level of safety that\n(i) enables safe traversal toward a desired goal location across a terrain map\nwith uncertain elevations, and (ii) formally incorporates uncertainty bounds\ninto the centroidal dynamics of locomotion control. To model the rough terrain,\nwe employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression to estimate elevation maps and\nleverage Conformal Prediction (CP) to construct calibrated confidence intervals\nthat capture the true terrain elevation. Building on this, we formulate\ncontraction-based reachable tubes that explicitly account for terrain\nuncertainty, ensuring state convergence and tube invariance. In addition, we\nintroduce a contraction-based flywheel torque control law for the reduced-order\nLinear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), which stabilizes the angular momentum\nabout the center-of-mass (CoM). This formulation provides both probabilistic\nsafety and goal reachability guarantees. For a given confidence level, we\nestablish the forward invariance of the proposed torque control law by\ndemonstrating exponential stabilization of the actual CoM phase-space\ntrajectory and the desired trajectory prescribed by the high-level planner.\nFinally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our planning framework through\nphysics-based simulations of the Digit bipedal robot in MuJoCo.",

Thanks to sampling-based\nmotion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require\nhuge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is\nlarge and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry\nand sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit\nmodels, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most\nprimitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been\ndesigned to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn\nrequires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent\ntransformations between implicit and explicit environment models during\nplanning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called\nInspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable\nsampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation\nduring planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a\ncomplex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates\nthat even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate\ninspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the\nstate-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the\nstate-of-the-art inspection planner.",

    "summary": "Dynamic loco-manipulation calls for effective whole-body control and\ncontact-rich interactions with the object and the environment. Existing\nlearning-based control synthesis relies on training low-level skill policies\nand explicitly switching with a high-level policy or a hand-designed finite\nstate machine, leading to quasi-static behaviors. In contrast, dynamic tasks\nsuch as soccer require the robot to run towards the ball, decelerate to an\noptimal approach to dribble, and eventually kick a goal - a continuum of smooth\nmotion. To this end, we propose Preferenced Oracle Guided Multi-mode Policies\n(OGMP) to learn a single policy mastering all the required modes and preferred\nsequence of transitions to solve uni-object loco-manipulation tasks. We design\nhybrid automatons as oracles to generate references with continuous dynamics\nand discrete mode jumps to perform a guided policy optimization through bounded\nexploration. To enforce learning a desired sequence of mode transitions, we\npresent a task-agnostic preference reward that enhances performance. The\nproposed approach demonstrates successful loco-manipulation for tasks like\nsoccer and moving boxes omnidirectionally through whole-body control. In\nsoccer, a single policy learns to optimally reach the ball, transition to\ncontact-rich dribbling, and execute successful goal kicks and ball stops.\nLeveraging the oracle's abstraction, we solve each loco-manipulation task on\nrobots with varying morphologies, including HECTOR V1, Berkeley Humanoid,\nUnitree G1, and H1, using the same reward definition and weights.",

    "title": "AVO: Amortized Value Optimization for Contact Mode Switching in\n  Multi-Finger Manipulation",
    "summary": "Dexterous manipulation tasks often require switching between different\ncontact modes, such as rolling, sliding, sticking, or non-contact contact\nmodes. When formulating dexterous manipulation tasks as a trajectory\noptimization problem, a common approach is to decompose these tasks into\nsub-tasks for each contact mode, which are each solved independently.\nOptimizing each sub-task independently can limit performance, as optimizing\ncontact points, contact forces, or other variables without information about\nfuture sub-tasks can place the system in a state from which it is challenging\nto make progress on subsequent sub-tasks. Further, optimizing these sub-tasks\nis very computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose\nAmortized Value Optimization (AVO), which introduces a learned value function\nthat predicts the total future task performance. By incorporating this value\nfunction into the cost of the trajectory optimization at each planning step,\nthe value function gradients guide the optimizer toward states that minimize\nthe cost in future sub-tasks. This effectively bridges separately optimized\nsub-tasks, and accelerates the optimization by reducing the amount of online\ncomputation needed. We validate AVO on a screwdriver grasping and turning task\nin both simulation and real world experiments, and show improved performance\neven with 50% less computational budget compared to trajectory optimization\nwithout the value function.",

    "summary": "Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a core problem in robotics, in which joint\nconfigurations are found to achieve a desired end-effector pose. Although\nanalytical solvers are fast and efficient, they are limited to systems with low\ndegrees-of-freedom and specific topological structures. Numerical\noptimization-based approaches are more general, but suffer from high\ncomputational costs and frequent convergence to spurious local minima. Recent\nefforts have explored the use of GPUs to combine sampling and optimization to\nenhance both the accuracy and speed of IK solvers. We build on this recent\nliterature and introduce HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid\nsolver that combines an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent\ninitialization scheme with a Jacobian-based polishing routine. This design\nenables our solver to improve both convergence speed and overall accuracy as\ncompared to the state-of-the-art, consistently finding solutions along the\naccuracy-latency Pareto frontier and often achieving order-of-magnitude gains.\nIn addition, our method produces a broad distribution of high-quality samples,\nyielding the lowest maximum mean discrepancy.

    "summary": "Mission planning can often be formulated as a constrained control problem\nunder multiple path constraints (i.e., safety constraints) and budget\nconstraints (i.e., resource expenditure constraints). In a priori unknown\nenvironments, verifying that an offline solution will satisfy the constraints\nfor all time can be difficult, if not impossible. We present ReRoot, a novel\nsampling-based framework that enforces safety and budget constraints for\nnonlinear systems in unknown environments. The main idea is that ReRoot grows\nmultiple reverse RRT* trees online, starting from renewal sets, i.e., sets\nwhere the budget constraints are renewed. The dynamically feasible backup\ntrajectories guarantee safety and reduce resource expenditure, which provides a\nprincipled backup policy when integrated into the gatekeeper safety\nverification architecture. We demonstrate our approach in simulation with a\nfixed-wing UAV in a GNSS-denied environment with a budget constraint on\nlocalization error that can be renewed at visual landmarks.",

    "title": "Estimating Dynamic Soft Continuum Robot States From Boundaries",
    "summary": "State estimation is one of the fundamental problems in robotics. For soft\ncontinuum robots, this task is particularly challenging because their states\n(poses, strains, internal wrenches, and velocities) are inherently\ninfinite-dimensional functions due to their continuous deformability.\nTraditional sensing techniques, however, can only provide discrete\nmeasurements. Recently, a dynamic state estimation method known as a\n\\textit{boundary observer} was introduced, which uses Cosserat rod theory to\nrecover all infinite-dimensional states by measuring only the tip velocity. In\nthis work, we present a dual design that instead relies on measuring the\ninternal wrench at the robot's base. Despite the duality, this new approach\noffers a key practical advantage: it requires only a force/torque (FT) sensor\nembedded at the base and eliminates the need for external motion capture\nsystems. Both observer types are inspired by principles of energy dissipation\nand can be naturally combined to enhance performance. We conduct a\nLyapunov-based analysis to study the convergence rate of these boundary\nobservers and reveal a useful property: as the observer gains increase, the\nconvergence rate initially improves and then degrades. This convex trend\nenables efficient tuning of the observer gains. We also identify special cases\nwhere linear and angular states are fully determined by each other, which\nfurther relaxes sensing requirements. Experimental studies using a\ntendon-driven continuum robot validate the convergence of all observer variants\nunder fast dynamic motions, the existence of optimal gains, robustness against\nunknown external forces, and the algorithm's real-time computational\nperformance.",

    "summary": "Underwater ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) are indispensable for subsea\nexploration and task execution, yet typical teleoperation engines based on\negocentric (first-person) video feeds restrict human operators' field-of-view\nand limit precise maneuvering in complex, unstructured underwater environments.\nTo address this, we propose EgoExo, a geometry-driven solution integrated into\na visual SLAM pipeline that synthesizes on-demand exocentric (third-person)\nviews from egocentric camera feeds. Our proposed framework, EgoExo++, extends\nbeyond 2D exocentric view synthesis (EgoExo) to augment a dense 2.5D ground\nsurface estimation on-the-fly. It simultaneously renders the ROV model onto\nthis reconstructed surface, enhancing semantic perception and depth\ncomprehension. The computations involved are closed-form and rely solely on\negocentric views and monocular SLAM estimates, which makes it portable across\nexisting teleoperation engines and robust to varying waterbody characteristics.\nWe validate the geometric accuracy of our approach through extensive\nexperiments of 2-DOF indoor navigation and 6-DOF underwater cave exploration in\nchallenging low-light conditions. Quantitative metrics confirm the reliability\nof the rendered Exo views, while a user study involving 15 operators\ndemonstrates improved situational awareness, navigation safety, and task\nefficiency during teleoperation. Furthermore, we highlight the role of EgoExo++\naugmented visuals in supporting shared autonomy, operator training, and\nembodied teleoperation. This new interactive approach to ROV teleoperation\npresents promising opportunities for future research in subsea telerobotics.",
