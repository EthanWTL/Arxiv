    "summary": "We introduce gridfm-datakit-v1, a Python library for generating realistic and diverse Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) datasets for training Machine Learning (ML) solvers. Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$Δ$ are provided.

    "title": "Understanding Sampler Stochasticity in Training Diffusion Models for RLHF",
    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.",

    "title": "One Layer Is Enough: Adapting Pretrained Visual Encoders for Image Generation",
    "summary": "Visual generative models (e.g., diffusion models) typically operate in compressed latent spaces to balance training efficiency and sample quality. In parallel, there has been growing interest in leveraging high-quality pre-trained visual representations, either by aligning them inside VAEs or directly within the generative model. However, adapting such representations remains challenging due to fundamental mismatches between understanding-oriented features and generation-friendly latent spaces. Representation encoders benefit from high-dimensional latents that capture diverse hypotheses for masked regions, whereas generative models favor low-dimensional latents that must faithfully preserve injected noise. This discrepancy has led prior work to rely on complex objectives and architectures. In this work, we propose FAE (Feature Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective framework that adapts pre-trained visual representations into low-dimensional latents suitable for generation using as little as a single attention layer, while retaining sufficient information for both reconstruction and understanding. The key is to couple two separate deep decoders: one trained to reconstruct the original feature space, and a second that takes the reconstructed features as input for image generation. FAE is generic; it can be instantiated with a variety of self-supervised encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP) and plugged into two distinct generative families: diffusion models and normalizing flows. Across class-conditional and text-to-image benchmarks, FAE achieves strong performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256, our diffusion model with CFG attains a near state-of-the-art FID of 1.29 (800 epochs) and 1.70 (80 epochs). Without CFG, FAE reaches the state-of-the-art FID of 1.48 (800 epochs) and 2.08 (80 epochs), demonstrating both high quality and fast learning.",

    "summary": "Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors, antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.",

    "summary": "Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.",

    "summary": "Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions. Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on short-form benchmarks.\n  We introduce \\textbf{Latent Self-Consistency (LSC)}, which selects the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. LSC's lightweight forward processing of summary tokens only introduces negligible runtime overhead (at most $0.9\\%$) on top of standard decoding of the base LLM, and requires no changes to the model architecture.\n  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU, TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC, and WUCS on both short-form and long-form on average performance, while adding negligible computational overhead on vanilla inference. These results position LSC as a reliable consistency-selection method that works effectively across various answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated confidence estimates, maintaining low expected calibration error across both answer formats.",

    "summary": "As the number of web applications and API endpoints exposed to the Internet continues to grow, so does the number of exploitable vulnerabilities. Manually identifying such vulnerabilities is tedious. Meanwhile, static security scanners tend to produce many false positives. While machine learning-based approaches are promising, they typically perform well only in scenarios where training and test data are closely related. A key challenge for ML-based vulnerability detection is providing suitable and concise code context, as excessively long contexts negatively affect the code comprehension capabilities of machine learning models, particularly smaller ones.\n  This work introduces Trace Gadgets, a novel code representation that minimizes code context by removing non-related code. Trace Gadgets precisely capture the statements that cover the path to the vulnerability. As input for ML models, Trace Gadgets provide a minimal but complete context, thereby improving the detection performance. Moreover, we collect a large-scale dataset generated from real-world applications with manually curated labels to further improve the performance of ML-based vulnerability detectors. Our results show that state-of-the-art machine learning models perform best when using Trace Gadgets compared to previous code representations, surpassing the detection capabilities of industry-standard static scanners such as GitHub's CodeQL by at least 4% on a fully unseen dataset. By applying our framework to real-world applications, we identify and report previously unknown vulnerabilities in widely deployed software.",

Recent advances in music generation models have enabled diverse editing tasks such as timbre transfer, instrument substitution, and genre transformation. However, many existing works overlook the evaluation of their ability to preserve musical facets that should remain unchanged during editing a property we define as Music Context Preservation (MCP). While some studies do consider MCP, they adopt inconsistent evaluation protocols and metrics, leading to unreliable and unfair comparisons. To address this gap, we introduce the first MCP evaluation benchmark, MuseCPBench, which covers four categories of musical facets and enables comprehensive comparisons across five representative music editing baselines. Through systematic analysis along musical facets, methods, and models, we identify consistent preservation gaps in current music editing methods and provide insightful explanations. We hope our findings offer practical guidance for developing more effective and reliable music editing strategies with strong MCP capability",

Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Many practical decision-making problems involve tasks whose success depends on the entire system history, rather than on achieving a state with desired properties. Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes (NMRDPs) enables agents to tackle temporal-dependency tasks. This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency. We contribute to solving both issues with QR-MAX, a novel model-based algorithm for discrete NMRDPs that factorizes Markovian transition learning from non-Markovian reward handling via reward machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm for discrete-action NMRDPs that exploits this factorization to obtain PAC convergence to $\\varepsilon$-optimal policies with polynomial sample complexity. We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation. We experimentally compare our method with modern state-of-the-art model-based RL approaches on environments of increasing complexity, showing a significant improvement in sample efficiency and increased robustness in finding optimal policies.",

Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a \"System 2\" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model \"Judge-Scout\" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40% ccompared to the best single scout models.

Existing detection methods typically rely on manipulation-specific cues, performing well on known forgery types but exhibiting severe limitations against emerging manipulation techniques. This poor generalization stems from their inability to adapt effectively to unseen forgery patterns. To overcome this, we leverage large-scale pretrained models (e.g. CLIP) to proactively probe the feature space, explicitly highlighting distributional gaps between real videos, known forgeries, and unseen manipulations. Specifically, FakeRadar introduces Forgery Outlier Probing, which employs dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples near boundaries of estimated subclusters, simulating novel forgery artifacts beyond known manipulation types. Additionally, we design Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, which optimizes the detector to distinguish real, fake, and outlier samples using proposed outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses. Experiments show that FakeRadar outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets for deepfake video detection, particularly in cross-domain evaluations, by handling the variety of emerging manipulation techniques.",

    "summary": "Globally, on-road transportation accounts for 15% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and an estimated 385,000 premature deaths from PM2.5. Cities play a critical role in meeting IPCC targets, generating 75% of global energy-related GHG emissions. In Houston, Texas, on-road transportation represents 48% of baseline emissions in the Climate Action Plan (CAP). To reach net-zero by 2050, the CAP targets a 70% emissions reduction from a 2014 baseline, offset by 30% renewable energy. This goal is challenging because Houston is low-density and auto-dependent, with 89% of on-road emissions from cars and small trucks and limited public transit usage. Socio-economic disparities further constrain Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) adoption. Strategies focus on expanding ZEV access and reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by 20% through transit improvements and city design. This paper presents methods for establishing an on-road emissions baseline and evaluating policies that leverage socio-economic indicators and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to accelerate ZEV adoption and reduce VMT. Smart parking, transit incentives, secure data systems, and ZEV fleet management support improvements in modal split and system reliability. Policy options are analyzed and potential actions identified. To support evaluation, a simulation environment was developed in Unity 3D, enabling dynamic modeling of urban mobility and visualization of policy scenarios. Auto-dependent cities aiming for 2050 emission targets can benefit from the indicators, metrics, and technologies discussed.",

    "summary": "Nepali, a low-resource language spoken by over 32 million people, continues to face challenges in natural language processing (NLP) due to its complex grammar, agglutinative morphology, and limited availability of high-quality corpora. Most efforts to date have centered on basic encoder architectures; they remain insufficient for Nepali-specific text generation. This study presents a GPT-2-based Nepali language model trained using several training strategies inspired by GPT-3, including optimized learning rate schedules, batch scaling, and architectural refinements. A custom 16k Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer was trained exclusively on Nepali text to ensure more consistent segmentation and improved input representation. The model was pretrained on a combined dataset comprising a 10.75GB cleaned NepBERTa corpus and additional web-scraped Nepali news articles. FlashAttention was integrated to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. After two epochs, the model achieved a training loss of 3.168177, a validation loss of 3.081982, and a final perplexity of 21.80, demonstrating its capability to generate coherent Nepali news-style text.",

    "summary": "Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly assuming the role of the ''brain'' of AI agents. While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence, across 41 large language models and 7 challenging benchmarks, showing that scaling single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.",

    "summary": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for reliable and efficient predictive tools that support early intervention. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on handcrafted features and clinician expertise, while machine learning methods improve reproducibility but often struggle to generalize across noisy and heterogeneous clinical data. In this work, we propose Residual GRU with Multi-Head Self-Attention, a compact deep learning architecture designed for tabular clinical records. The model integrates residual bidirectional gated recurrent units for sequential modeling of feature columns, a channel reweighting block, and multi-head self-attention pooling with a learnable classification token to capture global context. We evaluate the model on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 5-fold stratified cross-validation and compare it against classical methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, as well as modern deep learning baselines including DeepMLP, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and Transformers. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.861, macro-F1 of 0.860, ROC-AUC of 0.908, and PR-AUC of 0.904, outperforming all baselines. Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of residual recurrence, channel gating, and attention pooling. t-SNE visualizations further indicate that the learned embeddings exhibit clearer separation between disease and non-disease classes compared to raw features. These results demonstrate that lightweight hybrid recurrent and attention-based architectures provide a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency for clinical risk prediction, supporting deployment in resource-constrained healthcare settings.",

The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data.

Existing methods predominantly rely on learning robust global representations or implicit feature alignment, which often fail to model explicit spatial correspondences crucial for accurate localization. In this work, we propose a novel correspondence-aware feature refinement framework, termed CLNet, that explicitly bridges the semantic and geometric gaps between different views. CLNet decomposes the view alignment process into three learnable and complementary modules: a Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) that spatially aligns cross-view features via latent correspondence fields; a Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) that remaps features across perspectives using an MLP-based transformation; and a Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) module that reweights informative feature channels guided by learned spatial cues. The proposed CLNet can jointly capture both high-level semantics and fine-grained alignments. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks, CVUSA, CVACT, VIGOR, and University-1652, demonstrate that our proposed CLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering better interpretability and generalizability.",

Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.",

    "summary": "Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at decoding stage enables processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

    "summary": "In computational pathology, weak supervision has become the standard for deep learning due to the gigapixel scale of WSIs and the scarcity of pixel-level annotations, with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) established as the principal framework for slide-level model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time. Our results indicate that learning rich, context-aware instance representations before aggregation is an effective and scalable alternative to complex pooling for whole-slide analysis.

    "summary": "Current artificial intelligence systems, despite remarkable capabilities in text generation and pattern recognition, exhibit a fundamental architectural limitation: they resolve ambiguity prematurely. This premature semantic collapse -- the tendency to collapse multiple valid interpretations into a single output -- stems from classical identity assumptions embedded in standard neural architectures. We propose Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a computational framework that treats ambiguity retention as a valid reasoning mode rather than a defect to be eliminated. NRR introduces three core principles: (1) Non-Identity (A $\\ne$ A) -- the same symbol refers to different entities across contexts; (2) Approximate Identity (A $\\approx$ A) -- entities share partial structural overlap without being identical; and (3) Non-Resolution -- conflicting interpretations can coexist without forced convergence. We formalize these principles through three architectural components: Multi-Vector Embeddings for context-dependent representation, Non-Collapsing Attention for parallel interpretation retention, and Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT) for maintaining A $\\ne$ A across inference. We demonstrate NRR's advantages through case studies in paradox handling, creative generation, and context-dependent reasoning. Crucially, we provide a minimal empirical validation on a synthetic context-shift task where an NRR-lite model achieves 90.9% out-of-distribution accuracy compared to 9.1% for standard architectures, demonstrating that ambiguity preservation enables structural generalization. NRR challenges the assumption that meaning must collapse to be useful, offering a foundation for AI systems capable of sophisticated ambiguity handling and creative reasoning. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control.",

    "title": "Group-robust Machine Unlearning",
    "summary": "Machine unlearning is an emerging paradigm to remove the influence of specific training data (i.e., the forget set) from a model while preserving its knowledge of the rest of the data (i.e., the retain set). Previous approaches assume the forget data to be uniformly distributed from all training datapoints. However, if the data to unlearn is dominant in one group (e.g., ethnicity, gender), we empirically show that performance for this group degrades, leading to fairness issues. To perform unlearning while preserving fairness, this work addresses the overlooked problem of non-uniformly distributed forget sets, which we refer to as group-robust machine unlearning. We formalize the problem and present a simple and effective exact unlearning strategy that mitigates the performance loss in dominant groups via sample distribution reweighting. Moreover, we present MIU (Mutual Information-aware Machine Unlearning), the first approach for group robustness in approximate machine unlearning. MIU minimizes the mutual information between model features and group information, achieving unlearning while reducing performance degradation in the dominant group of the forget set. Additionally, MIU exploits sample distribution reweighting and mutual information calibration with the original model to preserve group robustness. We conduct experiments on three datasets and show that MIU outperforms standard methods, achieving unlearning without compromising model robustness.

We treat the supply chain network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative data fully intelligible to the LLM.

    "summary": "Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is essential for pinpointing the root causes of failures in microservice systems. Traditional data-driven RCA methods are typically limited to offline applications due to high computational demands, and existing online RCA methods handle only single-modal data, overlooking complex interactions in multi-modal systems. In this paper, we introduce OCEAN, a novel online multi-modal causal structure learning method for root cause localization. OCEAN employs a dilated convolutional neural network to capture long-term temporal dependencies and graph neural networks to learn causal relationships among system entities and key performance indicators. We further design a multi-factor attention mechanism to analyze and reassess the relationships among different metrics and log indicators/attributes for enhanced online causal graph learning. Additionally, a contrastive mutual information maximization-based graph fusion module is developed to effectively model the relationships across various modalities. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.",

    "summary": "Repository-level code translation refers to translating an entire code repository from one programming language to another while preserving the functionality of the source repository. Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such code translators. However, previous benchmarks mostly provide fine-grained samples, focusing at either code snippet, function, or file-level code translation. Such benchmarks do not accurately reflect real-world demands, where entire repositories often need to be translated, involving longer code length and more complex functionalities. To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, named RepoTransBench, which is a real-world multilingual repository-level code translation benchmark featuring 1,897 real-world repository samples across 13 language pairs with automatically executable test suites. Besides, we introduce RepoTransAgent, a general agent framework to perform repository-level code translation. We evaluate both our benchmark's challenges and agent's effectiveness using several methods and backbone LLMs, revealing that repository-level translation remains challenging, where the best-performing method achieves only a 32.8% success rate. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that translation difficulty varies significantly by language pair direction, with dynamic-to-static language translation being much more challenging than the reverse direction (achieving below 10% vs. static-to-dynamic at 45-63%). Finally, we conduct a detailed error analysis and highlight current LLMs' deficiencies in repository-level code translation, which could provide a reference for further improvements. We provide the code and data at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/RepoTransBench.",

    "summary": "The notion of causal effect is fundamental across many scientific disciplines. Traditionally, quantitative researchers have studied causal effects at the level of variables; for example, how a certain drug dose (W) causally affects a patient's blood pressure (Y). However, in many modern data domains, the raw variables-such as pixels in an image or tokens in a language model-do not have the semantic structure needed to formulate meaningful causal questions. In this paper, we offer a more fine-grained perspective by studying causal effects at the level of events, drawing inspiration from probability theory, where core notions such as independence are first given for events and sigma-algebras, before random variables enter the picture. Within the measure-theoretic framework of causal spaces, a recently introduced axiomatisation of causality, we first introduce several binary definitions that determine whether a causal effect is present, as well as proving some properties of them linking causal effect to (in)dependence under an intervention measure. Further, we provide quantifying measures that capture the strength and nature of causal effects on events, and show that we can recover the common measures of treatment effect as special cases.",

However, these benchmarks fail to assess whether such improvements translate to better performance when integrated into an autonomous driving stack. In this work, we systematically evaluate the interplay between state-of-the-art motion predictors and motion planners. Our results show that higher open-loop accuracy does not always correlate with better closed-loop driving behavior and that other factors, such as temporal consistency of predictions and planner compatibility, also play a critical role. Furthermore, we investigate downsized variants of these models, and, surprisingly, find that in some cases models with up to 86% fewer parameters yield comparable or even superior closed-loop driving performance.

Model quantization mitigates this issue by lowering weight and activation precision, but existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs: dynamic quantization incurs high computational overhead and poses deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.",

This paper introduces a new publicly available dataset containing annotated images of three different tunnel linings, capturing typical defects: cracks, leaching, and water infiltration. The dataset is designed to support supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised DL methods for defect detection and segmentation. Its diversity in texture and construction techniques also enables investigation of model generalization and transferability across tunnel types. By addressing the critical lack of domain-specific data, this dataset contributes to advancing automated tunnel inspection and promoting safer, more efficient infrastructure maintenance strategies.",

Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains. Our results suggest that many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations, highlighting explicit modeling as a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents.

    "summary": "In long-context question answering (LCQA), determining the optimal amount of context for a given query is a significant challenge. Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \\emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \\emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \\emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines \"minimal sufficient sets\" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.",

While existing adversarial attacks primarily focus on content falsification or instruction injection, we identify a novel, process-oriented attack surface: the agent's reasoning style. We propose Reasoning-Style Poisoning (RSP), a paradigm that manipulates how agents process information rather than what they process. We introduce Generative Style Injection (GSI), an attack method that rewrites retrieved documents into pathological tones--specifically \"analysis paralysis\" or \"cognitive haste\"--without altering underlying facts or using explicit triggers. To quantify these shifts, we develop the Reasoning Style Vector (RSV), a metric tracking Verification depth, Self-confidence, and Attention focus. Experiments on HotpotQA and FEVER using ReAct, Reflection, and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) architectures reveal that GSI significantly degrades performance. It increases reasoning steps by up to 4.4 times or induces premature errors, successfully bypassing state-of-the-art content filters. Finally, we propose RSP-M, a lightweight runtime monitor that calculates RSV metrics in real-time and triggers alerts when values exceed safety thresholds. Our work demonstrates that reasoning style is a distinct, exploitable vulnerability, necessitating process-level defenses beyond static content analysis.",

While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.",

One of the frequently-used approaches to solve such problems is to use evolutionary algorithms that evolve a desired diverse population.

We prove that the GSEMO computes a set of all Pareto-optimal solutions in $O(kn^3)$ expected iterations. We also analyze the runtime of the GSEMO$_D$ algorithm (a modification of the GSEMO for diversity optimization) until it finds a population with the best possible diversity for two different diversity measures: the total imbalance and the sorted imbalances vector. For the first measure we show that the GSEMO$_D$ optimizes it in $O(kn^2\\log(n))$ expected iterations (which is asymptotically faster than the upper bound on the runtime until it finds a Pareto-optimal population), and for the second measure we show an upper bound of $O(k^2n^3\\log(n))$ expected iterations.\n  We complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical study, which shows a very similar behavior for both diversity measures. The results of experiments suggest that our bounds for the total imbalance measure are tight, while the bounds for the imbalances vector are too pessimistic.",

    "summary": "Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval, fev-bench and Chronos-ZS benchmarks, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference. We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code, providing a reproducible foundation for future research.",

    "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, robust image caption evaluation using LVLMs remains challenging, particularly under domain-shift scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce the Distribution-Aware Score Decoder (DISCODE), a novel finetuning-free method that generates robust evaluation scores better aligned with human judgments across diverse domains. The core idea behind DISCODE lies in its test-time adaptive evaluation approach, which introduces the Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss, leveraging a Gaussian prior distribution to improve robustness in evaluation score estimation. This loss is efficiently minimized at test time using an analytical solution that we derive. Furthermore, we introduce the Multi-domain Caption Evaluation (MCEval) benchmark, a new image captioning evaluation benchmark covering six distinct domains, designed to assess the robustness of evaluation metrics. In our experiments, we demonstrate that DISCODE achieves state-of-the-art performance as a reference-free evaluation metric across MCEval and four representative existing benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Vehicle Dispatching Systems (VDSs) are critical to the operational efficiency of Automated Container Terminals (ACTs). However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions. In this workflow, a self-correction loop inspired by the LLM Reflexion framework is created",

To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on our proposed multi-image dataset, with our analysis providing actionable insights for the research community.

Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.",

Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_φ$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

    "summary": "In creating sentence embeddings for Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, using transformer-based models like BERT leads to high accuracy, but require hundreds of millions of parameters. These models take in sentences as a sequence of tokens, and learn to encode the meaning of the sequence into embeddings such that those embeddings can be used reliably for NLI tasks. Essentially, every word is considered against every other word in the sequence, and the transformer model is able to determine the relationships between them, entirely from scratch. However, a model that accepts explicit linguistic structures like dependency parse trees may be able to leverage prior encoded information about these relationships, without having to learn them from scratch, thus improving learning efficiency. To investigate this, we adapt Graph Matching Networks (GMN) to operate on dependency parse trees, creating Tree Matching Networks (TMN). We compare TMN to a BERT based model on the SNLI entailment task and on the SemEval similarity task. TMN is able to achieve significantly better results with a significantly reduced memory footprint and much less training time than the BERT based model on the SNLI task, while both models struggled to preform well on the SemEval. Explicit structural representations significantly outperform sequence-based models at comparable scales, but current aggregation methods limit scalability. We propose multi-headed attention aggregation to address this limitation.",

While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have enabled effective image classification and reconstruction, their high cost and bulk limit practical use. Electroencephalography (EEG), by contrast, offers low cost and excellent temporal resolution, but its potential has been limited by the scarcity of large, high-quality datasets and by block-design experiments that introduce temporal confounds. To fill this gap, we present CrossPT-EEG, a benchmark for cross-participant and cross-time generalization of visual decoding from EEG. We collected EEG data from 16 participants while they viewed 4,000 images sampled from ImageNet, with image stimuli annotated at multiple levels of granularity. Our design includes two stages separated in time to allow cross-time generalization and avoid block-design artifacts. We also introduce benchmarks tailored to non-block design classification, as well as pre-training experiments to assess cross-time and cross-participant generalization. These findings highlight the dataset's potential to enhance EEG-based visual brain-computer interfaces, deepen our understanding of visual perception in biological systems, and suggest promising applications for improving machine vision models.",

Methods such as Coconut, SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses: Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.",

In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process. We propose a practical instantiation that identifies the causal structure via a greedy search guided by the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle. Our experiments show that CaDyT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data, discovering causal networks closer to the true underlying dynamics.",

However, existing methods suffer from limited transferability in cross-model evaluations. To address this, we propose Transferable Defense Against Malicious Image Edits (TDAE), a novel bimodal framework that enhances image immunity against malicious edits through coordinated image-text optimization. Specifically, at the visual defense level, we introduce FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM), which incorporates gradient regularization into the adversarial objective. By explicitly steering the perturbations toward flat minima, FDM amplifies immune robustness against unseen editing models. For textual enhancement protection, we propose an adversarial optimization paradigm named Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD), which periodically refines text embeddings to align the editing outcomes of immunized images with those of the original images, then updates the images under optimized embeddings. Through iterative adversarial updates to diverse embeddings, DPD enforces the generation of immunized images that seek a broader set of immunity-enhancing features, thereby achieving cross-model transferability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our TDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating malicious edits under both intra- and cross-model evaluations.",

    "summary": "Adaptive reasoning is essential for aligning the computational effort of large language models (LLMs) with the intrinsic difficulty of problems. Current chain-of-thought methods boost reasoning ability but indiscriminately generate long explanations, leading to evident inefficiency. However, existing reinforcement learning approaches to adaptive thinking remain unstable and heavily reward-dependent. Here we propose \\textbf{DART}, a supervised \\textbf{D}ifficulty-\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{R}easoning \\textbf{T}runcation framework that adjusts thinking length according to problem difficulty. By distilling concise reasoning patterns from stronger models, interpolating them into a continuum of reasoning styles, and curating optimal training data that balances correctness and compactness, DART learns when to ``stop thinking''. Across multiple mathematical benchmarks, experimental results demonstrate its remarkable efficiency while preserving or improving accuracy, achieving a significant 81.2\\% reasoning truncation (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on GSM8K dataset) with 5.33$\\times$ computational acceleration. DART provides a stable and general paradigm for efficient reasoning, advancing the development of adaptive intelligence in LLMs.",

    "summary": "Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However, widely used Gaussian i.i.d. initializations are designed to preserve activation variance under wide or infinite width assumptions. In deep and relatively narrow networks with sigmoidal nonlinearities, these schemes often drive preactivations into saturation, and collapse gradients. To address this, we introduce an odd-sigmoid activations and propose an activation aware initialization tailored to any function in this class. Our method remains robust over a wide band of variance scales, preserving both forward signal variance and backpropagated gradient norms even in very deep and narrow networks. Empirically, across standard image benchmarks we find that the proposed initialization is substantially less sensitive to depth, width, and activation scale than Gaussian initializations. In physics informed neural networks (PINNs), scaled odd-sigmoid activations combined with our initialization achieve lower losses than Gaussian based setups, suggesting that diagonal-plus-noise weights provide a practical alternative when Gaussian initialization breaks down.",

    "summary": "Recent progress in text-to-image diffusion models has transformed image editing via text prompts, yet this also introduces significant ethical challenges from potential misuse in creating deceptive or harmful content. While current defenses seek to mitigate this risk by embedding imperceptible perturbations, their effectiveness is limited against malicious tampering. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attention-Guided Noise Perturbation (DANP) immunization method that adds imperceptible perturbations to disrupt the model's semantic understanding and generation process. DANP functions over multiple timesteps to manipulate both cross-attention maps and the noise prediction process, using a dynamic threshold to generate masks that identify text-relevant and irrelevant regions. It then reduces attention in relevant areas while increasing it in irrelevant ones, thereby misguides the edit towards incorrect regions and preserves the intended targets. Additionally, our method maximizes the discrepancy between the injected noise and the model's predicted noise to further interfere with the generation. By targeting both attention and noise prediction mechanisms, DANP exhibits impressive immunity against malicious edits, and extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "summary": "The field of Language Reasoning Models (LRMs) has been very active over the past few years with advances in training and inference techniques enabling LRMs to reason longer, and more accurately. However, a growing body of studies show that LRMs are still inefficient, over-generating verification and reflection steps. To address this challenge, we introduce the Step-Tagging framework, a lightweight sentence-classifier enabling real-time annotation of the type of reasoning steps that an LRM is generating. To monitor reasoning behaviors, we introduced ReasonType: a novel taxonomy of reasoning steps. Building on this framework, we demonstrated that online monitoring of the count of specific steps can produce effective interpretable early stopping criteria of LRM inferences. We evaluate the Step-tagging framework on three open-source reasoning models across standard benchmark datasets: MATH500, GSM8K, AIME and non-mathematical tasks (GPQA and MMLU-Pro). We achieve 20 to 50\\% token reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy to standard generation, with largest gains observed on more computation-heavy tasks. This work offers a novel way to increase control over the generation of LRMs, and a new tool to study behaviors of LRMs.",

The research examines the attribution of human error, AI moral agency, and the identification of primary offenders in AV incidents. Findings reveal fragmented regulatory landscapes: India and the US rely on loose networks of state laws, whereas the UK enacted the pioneering Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018.

    "summary": "Dynamic prediction of locomotor capacity after stroke is crucial for tailoring rehabilitation, yet current assessments provide only static impairment scores and do not indicate whether patients can safely perform specific tasks such as slope walking or stair climbing. Here, we develop a data-physics hybrid generative framework that reconstructs an individual stroke survivor's neuromuscular control from a single 20 m level-ground walking trial and predicts task-conditioned locomotion across rehabilitation scenarios. The system combines wearable-sensor kinematics, a proportional-derivative physics controller, a population Healthy Motion Atlas, and goal-conditioned deep reinforcement learning with behaviour cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning to generate physically plausible, patient-specific gait simulations for slopes and stairs. In 11 stroke survivors, the personalized controllers preserved idiosyncratic gait patterns while improving joint-angle and endpoint fidelity by 4.73% and 12.10%, respectively, and reducing training time to 25.56% relative to a physics-only baseline. In a multicentre pilot involving 21 inpatients, clinicians who used our locomotion predictions to guide task selection and difficulty obtained larger gains in Fugl-Meyer lower-extremity scores over 28 days of standard rehabilitation than control clinicians (mean change 6.0 versus 3.7 points). These findings indicate that our generative, task-predictive framework can augment clinical decision-making in post-stroke gait rehabilitation and provide a template for dynamically personalized motor recovery strategies.",

    "summary": "Text-guided image editing via diffusion models, while powerful, raises significant concerns about misuse, motivating efforts to immunize images against unauthorized edits using imperceptible perturbations. Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments show our SIFM achieves the state-of-the-art performance for safeguarding visual content against malicious diffusion-based manipulation.",

    "summary": "In regions of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), there is a high demand for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), crucial for sustainable water management. Precise identification of WWTPs from satellite images enables environmental monitoring. Traditional methods like YOLOv8 segmentation require extensive manual labeling. But studies indicate that vision-language models (VLMs) are an efficient alternative to achieving equivalent or superior results through inherent reasoning and annotation. This study presents a structured methodology for VLM comparison, divided into zero-shot and few-shot streams specifically to identify WWTPs. The YOLOv8 was trained on a governmental dataset of 83,566 high-resolution satellite images from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and UAE: ~85% WWTPs (positives), 15% non-WWTPs (negatives). Evaluated VLMs include LLaMA 3.2 Vision, Qwen 2.5 VL, DeepSeek-VL2, Gemma 3, Gemini, and Pixtral 12B (Mistral), used to identify WWTP components such as circular/rectangular tanks, aeration basins and distinguish confounders via expert prompts producing JSON outputs with confidence and descriptions. The dataset comprises 1,207 validated WWTP locations (198 UAE, 354 KSA, 655 Egypt) and equal non-WWTP sites from field/AI data, as 600mx600m Geo-TIFF images (Zoom 18, EPSG:4326). Zero-shot evaluations on WWTP images showed several VLMs out-performing YOLOv8's true positive rate, with Gemma-3 highest. Results confirm that VLMs, particularly with zero-shot, can replace YOLOv8 for efficient, annotation-free WWTP classification, enabling scalable remote sensing.",

    "summary": "Stochastic disruptions such as flash events arising from benign traffic bursts and switch thermal fluctuations are major contributors to intermittent service degradation in software-defined industrial networks. These events violate IEC~61850-derived quality-of-service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC~61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime.\n  To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed.\n  Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and traffic prediction-based routing optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture.\n  Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning in building resilience in software-defined industrial networks deployed in mission-critical, time-sensitive application scenarios.",

    "title": "Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling for Accelerating Speculative Decoding in Large Language Models",
    "summary": "Speculative Decoding is a prominent technique for accelerating the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a fast draft model to propose candidate token sequences and a large target model to verify them in parallel. However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as 1 - max(P_target). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks.",

The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.\n  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.\n  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.\n  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.\n  Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.",

TabICL achieves a 0.8 percentage-point gain on Higgs but requires roughly 40,000 times more latency (960 s) and 9 GB VRAM. TabPFN matches tree-model accuracy on Wine and Housing but peaks at 4 GB VRAM and cannot process the full 100k-row Higgs table.

Nowadays, computerized methods, based on artificial intelligence, represent an interesting opportunity to improve the productivity and the objectivity of the microscopy-based Renal Cell Carcinoma diagnosis. Nonetheless, much of their exploitation is hampered by the paucity of annotated dataset, essential for a proficient training of supervised machine learning technologies. This study sets out to investigate a novel self supervised training strategy for machine learning diagnostic tools, based on the multi-resolution nature of the histological samples. We aim at reducing the need of annotated dataset, without significantly reducing the accuracy of the tool.

    "summary": "Artificial Intelligence tools such as large language models are increasingly used by the public to obtain health information and guidance. In health-related contexts, following or rejecting AI-generated advice can have direct clinical implications. Existing instruments like the Trust in Automated Systems Survey assess trustworthiness of generic technology, and no validated instrument measures users' trust in AI-generated health advice specifically. This study developed and validated the Trust in AI-Generated Health Advice (TAIGHA) scale and its four-item short form (TAIGHA-S) as theory-based instruments measuring trust and distrust, each with cognitive and affective components. The items were developed using a generative AI approach, followed by content validation with 10 domain experts, face validation with 30 lay participants, and psychometric validation with 385 UK participants who received AI-generated advice in a symptom-assessment scenario. After automated item reduction, 28 items were retained and reduced to 10 based on expert ratings. TAIGHA showed excellent content validity (S-CVI/Ave=0.99) and CFA confirmed a two-factor model with excellent fit (CFI=0.98, TLI=0.98, RMSEA=0.07, SRMR=0.03). Internal consistency was high (α=0.95). Convergent validity was supported by correlations with the Trust in Automated Systems Survey (r=0.67/-0.66) and users' reliance on the AI's advice (r=0.37 for trust), while divergent validity was supported by low correlations with reading flow and mental load (all |r|<0.25). TAIGHA-S correlated highly with the full scale (r=0.96) and showed good reliability (α=0.88). TAIGHA and TAIGHA-S are validated instruments for assessing user trust and distrust in AI-generated health advice.

    "title": "SPARQL-LLM: Real-Time SPARQL Query Generation from Natural Language Questions",
    "summary": "The advent of large language models is contributing to the emergence of novel approaches that promise to better tackle the challenge of generating structured queries, such as SPARQL queries, from natural language. However, these new approaches mostly focus on response accuracy over a single source while ignoring other evaluation criteria, such as federated query capability over distributed data stores, as well as runtime and cost to generate SPARQL queries. Consequently, they are often not production-ready or easy to deploy over (potentially federated) knowledge graphs with good accuracy. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we extend our previous work and describe and systematically evaluate SPARQL-LLM, an open-source and triplestore-agnostic approach, powered by lightweight metadata, that generates SPARQL queries from natural language text. First, we describe its architecture, which consists of dedicated components for metadata indexing, prompt building, and query generation and execution. Then, we evaluate it based on a state-of-the-art challenge with multilingual questions, and a collection of questions from three of the most prevalent knowledge graphs within the field of bioinformatics. Our results demonstrate a substantial increase of 24% in the F1 Score on the state-of-the-art challenge, adaptability to high-resource languages such as English and Spanish, as well as ability to form complex and federated bioinformatics queries. Furthermore, we show that SPARQL-LLM is up to 36x faster than other systems participating in the challenge, while costing a maximum of $0.01 per question, making it suitable for real-time, low-cost text-to-SPARQL applications. One such application deployed over real-world decentralized knowledge graphs can be found at https://www.expasy.org/chat.",

    "title": "Masked Omics Modeling for Multimodal Representation Learning across Histopathology and Molecular Profiles",
    "summary": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has driven major advances in computational pathology by enabling the learning of rich representations from histopathology data. Yet, tissue analysis alone may fall short in capturing broader molecular complexity, as key complementary information resides in high-dimensional omics profiles such as transcriptomics, methylomics, and genomics. To address this gap, we introduce MORPHEUS, the first multimodal pre-training strategy that integrates histopathology images and multi-omics data within a shared transformer-based architecture. At its core, MORPHEUS relies on a novel masked omics modeling objective that encourages the model to learn meaningful cross-modal relationships. This yields a general-purpose pre-trained encoder that can be applied to histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities. Beyond inference, MORPHEUS also supports flexible any-to-any omics reconstruction, enabling one or more omics profiles to be reconstructed from any modality subset that includes histopathology. Pre-trained on a large pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS shows substantial improvements over supervised and SSL baselines across diverse tasks and modality combinations. Together, these capabilities position it as a promising direction for the development of multimodal foundation models in oncology.

    "summary": "Satellite-based radar retrieval methods are widely employed to fill coverage gaps in ground-based radar systems, especially in remote areas affected by terrain blockage and limited detection range. Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries.",

Yet this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against itself-a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following, mathematics, and coding benchmarks show that pretrained models can be effectively improved with self-play alone.",

    "summary": "Managing extensive context remains a critical bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in applications like long-document question answering and autonomous agents where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.",

    "summary": "Graph generation is a crucial task in many fields, including network science and bioinformatics, as it enables the creation of synthetic graphs that mimic the properties of real-world networks for various applications. Graph Generative Models (GGMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, leveraging deep learning techniques to learn the underlying distribution of real-world graphs and generate new samples that closely resemble them. Examples include approaches based on Variational Auto-Encoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently, diffusion-based models. However, the main limitation often lies in the evaluation process, which typically relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to assess the distribution of graph properties in the generated ensemble. This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating GGMs that overcomes the limitations of MMD, which we call RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE). We investigate their performance in generating realistic graphs and compare them using a Geometric Deep Learning model trained on a custom dataset of synthetic and real-world graphs, specifically designed for graph classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while both models can generate graphs with certain topological properties, they exhibit significant limitations in preserving the structural characteristics that distinguish different graph domains. We also highlight the inadequacy of Maximum Mean Discrepancy as an evaluation metric for GGMs and suggest alternative approaches for future research.",

    "summary": "As large language models increasingly mediate stigmatized health decisions, their capacity to genuinely understand complex psychological and physiological phenomena remains poorly evaluated. Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms.",

    "summary": "Black-box tuning is an emerging paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to better achieve desired behaviors, particularly when direct access to model parameters is unavailable. Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with \"LogitMap Pairs\" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation.",

Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automation, existing applications rely on simplistic prompting without task decomposition or domain adaptation, resulting in unreliable black-box behavior and limited insight into model capabilities across penetration testing stages. To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance. PentestEval provides the foundational benchmark needed for future research on fine-grained, stage-level evaluation, paving the way toward more reliable LLM-based automation.",

    "summary": "Georeferencing text documents has typically relied on either gazetteer-based methods to assign geographic coordinates to place names, or on language modelling approaches that associate textual terms with geographic locations. However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data. The best results (New York state) were 85% within 10km and 67% within 1km. The selected LLM performs well for lengthy, complex descriptions, highlighting its potential for georeferencing intricate locality descriptions.",

However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting. Therefore, IdealTSF is particularly well-suited for applications with noisy samples or low-quality data.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in the finetuning of large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance on established benchmarks, emphasizing the need for increasingly difficult, synthetic data. A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \\geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\\%$ noise injection. Our work represents a significant step towards replacing time-consuming human annotations and synthetic data generation, and will be an important driver for curriculum design, model evaluation, and AI-assisted research ideation.",

    "title": "Error Bound Analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks-Driven T2 Quantification in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging",
    "summary": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are emerging as a promising approach for quantitative parameter estimation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While existing deep learning methods can provide an accurate quantitative estimation of the T2 parameter, they still require large amounts of training data and lack theoretical support and a recognized gold standard. Thus, given the absence of PINN-based approaches for T2 estimation, we propose embedding the fundamental physics of MRI, the Bloch equation, in the loss of PINN, which is solely based on target scan data and does not require a pre-defined training database. Furthermore, by deriving rigorous upper bounds for both the T2 estimation error and the generalization error of the Bloch equation solution, we establish a theoretical foundation for evaluating the PINN's quantitative accuracy. Even without access to the ground truth or a gold standard, this theory enables us to estimate the error with respect to the real quantitative parameter T2. The accuracy of T2 mapping and the validity of the theoretical analysis are demonstrated on a numerical cardiac model and a water phantom, where our method exhibits excellent quantitative precision in the myocardial T2 range. Clinical applicability is confirmed in 94 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, achieving low-error quantitative T2 estimation under the theoretical error bound, highlighting the robustness and potential of PINN.",

    "title": "Structured Sparse Transition Matrices to Enable State Tracking in State-Space Models",
    "summary": "Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity, as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA). While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N \\times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of variable-length English sentences.

    "summary": "The early identification and intervention of latent depression are of significant societal importance for mental health governance. While current automated detection methods based on social media have shown progress, their decision-making processes often lack a clinically interpretable framework, particularly in capturing the duration and dynamic evolution of depressive symptoms. To address this, this study introduces a semantic parsing network integrated with multi-scale temporal prototype learning. The model detects depressive states by capturing temporal patterns and semantic prototypes in users' emotional expression, providing a duration-aware interpretation of underlying symptoms. Validated on a large-scale social media dataset, the model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Analytical results indicate that the model can identify emotional expression patterns not systematically documented in traditional survey-based approaches, such as sustained narratives expressing admiration for an \"alternative life.\" Further user evaluation demonstrates the model's superior interpretability compared to baseline methods. This research contributes a structurally transparent, clinically aligned framework for depression detection in social media to the information systems literature. In practice, the model can generate dynamic emotional profiles for social platform users, assisting in the targeted allocation of mental health support resources.",

    "summary": "The current study describes a cost-effective method for adapting large language models (LLMs) for academic advising with study-abroad contexts in mind and for application in low-resource methods for acculturation. With the Mistral-7B-Instruct model applied with a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method and a 4-bit quantization method, the model underwent training in two distinct stages related to this study's purpose to enhance domain specificity while maintaining computational efficiency. In Phase 1, the model was conditioned with a synthetic dataset via the Gemini Pro API, and in Phase 2, it was trained with manually curated datasets from the StudyAbroadGPT project to achieve enhanced, contextualized responses. Technical innovations entailed memory-efficient quantization, parameter-efficient adaptation, and continuous training analytics via Weights & Biases. After training, this study demonstrated a reduction in training loss by 52.7%, 92% accuracy in domain-specific recommendations, achieved 95% markdown-based formatting support, and a median run-rate of 100 samples per second on off-the-shelf GPU equipment. These findings support the effective application of instruction-tuned LLMs within educational advisers, especially in low-resource institutional scenarios. Limitations included decreased generalizability and the application of a synthetically generated dataset, but this framework is scalable for adding new multilingual-augmented and real-time academic advising processes. Future directions may include plans for the integration of retrieval-augmented generation, applying dynamic quantization routines, and connecting to real-time academic databases to increase adaptability and accuracy.",

    "summary": "The performance of reinforcement learning (RL) agents depends critically on the quality of the underlying feature representations. Hyperbolic feature spaces are well-suited for this purpose, as they naturally capture hierarchical and relational structure often present in complex RL environments. However, leveraging these spaces commonly faces optimization challenges due to the nonstationarity of RL. In this work, we identify key factors that determine the success and failure of training hyperbolic deep RL agents. By analyzing the gradients of core operations in the Poincaré Ball and Hyperboloid models of hyperbolic geometry, we show that large-norm embeddings destabilize gradient-based training, leading to trust-region violations in proximal policy optimization (PPO). Based on these insights, we introduce Hyper++, a new hyperbolic PPO agent that consists of three components: (i) stable critic training through a categorical value loss instead of regression; (ii) feature regularization guaranteeing bounded norms while avoiding the curse of dimensionality from clipping; and (iii) using a more optimization-friendly formulation of hyperbolic network layers. In experiments on ProcGen, we show that Hyper++ guarantees stable learning, outperforms prior hyperbolic agents, and reduces wall-clock time by approximately 30%. On Atari-5 with Double DQN, Hyper++ strongly outperforms Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines. We release our code at https://github.com/Probabilistic-and-Interactive-ML/hyper-rl .",

    "summary": "Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL series. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly but maintains prior knowledge. We study this phenomenon through learning dynamics by examining both the magnitude and direction of how training data influence prior knowledge. Our analysis shows that RFT mainly reinforces correct samples naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, leading to weaker interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, training on RFT-simulated rollouts, which exert a small magnitude of influence and are well aligned in direction to prior knowledge, allows SFT to preserve prior knowledge better while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that distribution of training data, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.",

    "summary": "Selecting a solution algorithm for the Facility Layout Problem (FLP), an NP-hard optimization problem with multiobjective trade-off, is a complex task that requires deep expert knowledge. The performance of a given algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the problem, such as the number of facilities, objectives, and constraints. This creates a need for a data-driven recommendation method to guide algorithm selection in automated design systems. This paper introduces a new recommendation method to make this expertise accessible, based on a Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework. In this framework, a domain-specific knowledge graph (KG) is constructed from the literature. The method then employs a multifaceted retrieval mechanism to gather relevant evidence from this KG using three distinct approaches: precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based search, and cluster-based high-level search. The retrieved evidence is utilized by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations based on data-driven reasoning. This KG-RAG framework is tested on a use case consisting of six problems comprising of complex multi-objective and multi-constraint FLP case. The results are compared with the Gemini 1.5 Flash chatbot. The results show that KG-RAG achieves an average reasoning score of 4.7 out of 5 compared to 3.3 for the baseline chatbot.",

Its modular design allows ELVIS to integrate different codecs, inpainting models, and quality metrics, making it adaptable to future innovations. Our results show that current technologies achieve improvements of up to 11 VMAF points over baseline benchmarks, though challenges remain for real-time applications due to computational demands. ELVIS represents a foundational step toward incorporating generative AI into video streaming pipelines, enabling higher quality experiences without increased bandwidth requirements.",

A crucial component of QNNs is the encoder, which maps classical input data into quantum states. However, choosing suitable encoders remains a significant challenge, largely due to the lack of systematic guidance and the trial-and-error nature of current approaches. This process is further impeded by two key challenges: (1) the difficulty in evaluating encoded quantum states prior to training, and (2) the lack of intuitive methods for analyzing an encoder's ability to effectively distinguish data features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel visualization tool, XQAI-Eyes, which enables QNN developers to compare classical data features with their corresponding encoded quantum states and to examine the mixed quantum states across different classes. By bridging classical and quantum perspectives, XQAI-Eyes facilitates a deeper understanding of how encoders influence QNN performance. Evaluations across diverse datasets and encoder designs demonstrate XQAI-Eyes's potential to support the exploration of the relationship between encoder design and QNN effectiveness, offering a holistic and transparent approach to optimizing quantum encoders. Moreover, domain experts used XQAI-Eyes to derive two key practices for quantum encoder selection, grounded in the principles of pattern preservation and feature mapping.",

To address this challenge, we propose an efficient reinforcement learning framework that leverages entropy signals at both the semantic and token levels to improve reasoning. From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens. By jointly optimizing data organization and algorithmic design, our method effectively mitigates entropy collapse and enhances LLM reasoning. Experimental results across 6 benchmarks with 3 different parameter-scale base models demonstrate that our method outperforms other entropy-based approaches in improving reasoning.",

The second, a more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, utilizes structured local\\_dialect:standard\\_bengali sentence pairs. We evaluated both pipelines across six Bengali dialects and multiple LLMs using BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore. Our findings show that the sentence-pair pipeline consistently outperforms the transcript-based one, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) from 76\\% to 55\\% for the Chittagong dialect. Critically, this RAG approach enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to outperform much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), demonstrating that a well-designed retrieval strategy can be more crucial than model size. This work contributes an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in agentic AI have shifted the focus from standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrated systems that combine LLMs with tools, memory, and other agents to perform complex tasks. These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. These challenges emerged during our ongoing industry collaboration with MontyCloud Inc., when we deployed an agentic system in production. These limitations surfaced during deployment, highlighting practical gaps in the current evaluation methods and the need for a systematic assessment of agent behavior beyond task outcomes. Informed by these observations and established definitions of agentic systems, we propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment. We validate the framework on a representative Autonomous CloudOps use case, where experiments reveal behavioral deviations overlooked by conventional metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing runtime uncertainties.",

While this architecture decouples the reasoning engine from tool execution to enhance scalability, it introduces a significant privacy surface: third-party MCP servers, acting as semi-honest intermediaries, can observe detailed tool interaction logs outside the user's trusted boundary. In this paper, we first identify and formalize a novel privacy threat termed Intent Inversion, where a semi-honest MCP server attempts to reconstruct the user's private underlying intent solely by analyzing legitimate tool calls. To systematically assess this vulnerability, we propose IntentMiner, a framework that leverages Hierarchical Information Isolation and Three-Dimensional Semantic Analysis, integrating tool purpose, call statements, and returned results, to accurately infer user intent at the step level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IntentMiner achieves a high degree of semantic alignment (over 85%) with original user queries, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. These results highlight the inherent privacy risks in decoupled agent architectures, revealing that seemingly benign tool execution logs can serve as a potent vector for exposing user secrets.",

Survey respondents and models indicated whether each greenspace was attractive or unattractive and provided up to three free text explanations. Analyses examined how often their attractiveness judgments aligned and compared their explanations after classifying them into shared reasoning categories. Results show high AI human agreement for attractive formal greenspaces and unattractive informal spaces, but low alignment for attractive informal and unattractive formal greenspaces. Models consistently emphasized aesthetic and design oriented features, underrepresenting safety, functional infrastructure, and locally embedded qualities valued by survey respondents. While these findings highlight the potential for scalable pre-assessment, they also underscore the need for human oversight and complementary participatory approaches. We conclude that MLLMs can support, but not replace, context sensitive greenspace evaluation in planning practice.",

    "title": "Enhancing Geo-localization for Crowdsourced Flood Imagery via LLM-Guided Attention",
    "summary": "Crowdsourced street-view imagery from social media provides real-time visual evidence of urban flooding and other crisis events, yet it often lacks reliable geographic metadata for emergency response. Existing image geo-localization approaches, also known as Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models, exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geo-knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery.",

    "summary": "Recent reasoning based medical MLLMs have made progress in generating step by step textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely \"think with images\" through tool-integrated reasoning. Datasets, codes, and trained models will be released publicly.",

    "summary": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global mortality, necessitating accessible and accurate diagnostic tools. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides gold-standard insights into cardiac structure and function, its clinical utility is limited by high cost and complexity. In contrast, electrocardiography (ECG) is inexpensive and widely available but lacks the granularity of CMR. We propose CardioNets, a deep learning framework that translates 12-lead ECG signals into CMR-level functional parameters and synthetic images, enabling scalable cardiac assessment. CardioNets integrates cross-modal contrastive learning and generative pretraining, aligning ECG with CMR-derived cardiac phenotypes and synthesizing high-resolution CMR images via a masked autoregressive model. Trained on 159,819 samples from five cohorts, including the UK Biobank (n=42,483) and MIMIC-IV-ECG (n=164,550), and externally validated on independent clinical datasets (n=3,767), CardioNets achieved strong performance across disease screening and phenotype estimation tasks. In the UK Biobank, it improved cardiac phenotype regression R2 by 24.8% and cardiomyopathy AUC by up to 39.3% over baseline models. In MIMIC, it increased AUC for pulmonary hypertension detection by 5.6%. Generated CMR images showed 36.6% higher SSIM and 8.7% higher PSNR than prior approaches. In a reader study, ECG-only CardioNets achieved 13.9% higher accuracy than human physicians using both ECG and real CMR. These results suggest that CardioNets offers a promising, low-cost alternative to CMR for large-scale CVD screening, particularly in resource-limited settings. Future efforts will focus on clinical deployment and regulatory validation of ECG-based synthetic imaging.",

    "summary": "Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) enhance traditional KGs by integrating temporal and spatial annotations, enabling precise reasoning over questions with spatio-temporal dependencies. Despite their potential, research on spatio-temporal knowledge graph question answering (STKGQA) remains limited. This is primarily due to the lack of datasets that simultaneously contain spatio-temporal information, as well as methods capable of handling implicit spatio-temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the spatio-temporal question answering dataset (STQAD), the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 10,000 natural language questions that require both temporal and spatial reasoning. STQAD is constructed with real-world facts containing spatio-temporal information, ensuring that the dataset reflects practical scenarios. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that existing KGQA methods underperform on STQAD, primarily due to their inability to model spatio-temporal interactions. To address this, we propose the spatio-temporal complex question answering (STCQA) method, which jointly embeds temporal and spatial features into KG representations and dynamically filters answers through constraint-aware reasoning. STCQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Our work not only provides a valuable resource for future research but also advances the field by offering a robust baseline for answering complex spatio-temporal questions.",

    "summary": "Radio path loss prediction (RPP) is critical for optimizing 5G networks and enabling IoT, smart city, and similar applications. However, current deep learning-based RPP methods lack proactive environmental modeling, struggle with realistic multi-transmitter scenarios, and generalize poorly under distribution shifts, particularly when training/testing environments differ in building density or transmitter configurations. This paper identifies three key issues: (1) passive environmental modeling that overlooks transmitters and key environmental features; (2) overemphasis on single-transmitter scenarios despite real-world multi-transmitter prevalence; (3) excessive focus on in-distribution performance while neglecting distribution shift challenges. To address these, we propose PathFinder, a novel architecture that actively models buildings and transmitters via disentangled feature encoding and integrates Mask-Guided Low-rank Attention to independently focus on receiver and building regions. We also introduce a Transmitter-Oriented Mixup strategy for robust training and a new benchmark, single-to-multi-transmitter RPP (S2MT-RPP), tailored to evaluate extrapolation performance (multi-transmitter testing after single-transmitter training). Experimental results show PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly, especially in challenging multi-transmitter scenarios.

    "summary": "Identifying and addressing performance anti-patterns in machine learning (ML) models is critical for efficient training and inference, but it typically demands deep expertise spanning system infrastructure, ML models and kernel development. While large tech companies rely on dedicated ML infrastructure engineers to analyze torch traces and benchmarks, such resource-intensive workflows are largely inaccessible to computer vision researchers in general. Among the challenges, pinpointing problematic trace segments within lengthy execution traces remains the most time-consuming task, and is difficult to automate with current ML models, including LLMs. In this work, we present the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate and improve ML models' ability to detect anti patterns in traces. Our dataset contains over 600 PyTorch traces from diverse computer vision models classification, detection, segmentation, and generation collected across multiple hardware platforms. We also propose a novel iterative approach: a lightweight ML model first detects trace segments with anti patterns, followed by a large language model (LLM) for fine grained classification and targeted feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms unsupervised clustering and rule based statistical techniques for detecting anti pattern regions. Our method also effectively compensates LLM's limited context length and reasoning inefficiencies.",

    "summary": "In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context, and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations, and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context. Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated by a pretrained GNN and schema-based rule check, enabling process-level supervision without explicit labels. As an application, we also introduced Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines, which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target discovery in precision medicine.",

Through natural language conversations, the system helps users transform vague preferences into well-defined optimization problems. These instantiated problems are then passed to existing optimization solvers to generate solutions. In a user study on trip planning, our method successfully captured user preferences and generated feasible plans that outperformed both conventional and prompt-engineering approaches.

Recent advances of Large Language Models (LMMs) and motion analysis techniques provide new opportunities to address the above limitations. In this paper, we propose SportsGPT, an LLM-driven framework for interpretable sports motion assessment and training guidance, which establishes a closed loop from motion time-series input to professional training guidance. First, given a set of high-quality target models, we introduce MotionDTW, a two-stage time series alignment algorithm designed for accurate keyframe extraction from skeleton-based motion sequences. Subsequently, we design a Knowledge-based Interpretable Sports Motion Assessment Model (KISMAM) to obtain a set of interpretable assessment metrics (e.g., insufficient extension) by constrasting the keyframes with the targe models. Finally, we propose SportsRAG, a RAG-based training guidance model based on Qwen3. Leveraging a 6B-token knowledge base, it prompts the LLM to generate professional training guidance by retrieving domain-specific QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that MotionDTW significantly outperforms traditional methods with lower temporal error and higher IoU scores. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the KISMAM and SportsRAG, confirming that SportsGPT surpasses general LLMs in diagnostic accuracy and professionalism.",

    "summary": "The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving \"sink\" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios, which can greatly and fundamentally accelerate LLM long-context inference speed by up to 100%.

AI-driven solutions for automatically assessing the alignment of sustainability reports and non-financial disclosures with specific ESG activities could greatly support this process. Yet, this task remains complex due to the limitations of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-specific contexts and the scarcity of structured, high-quality datasets. In this paper, we investigate the ability of current-generation LLMs to identify text related to environmental activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their performance can be significantly enhanced through fine-tuning on a combination of original and synthetically generated data. To this end, we introduce ESG-Activities, a benchmark dataset containing 1,325 labelled text segments classified according to the EU ESG taxonomy. Our experimental results show that fine-tuning on ESG-Activities significantly enhances classification accuracy, with open models such as Llama 7B and Gemma 7B outperforming large proprietary solutions in specific configurations. These findings have important implications for financial analysts, policymakers, and AI researchers seeking to enhance ESG transparency and compliance through advanced natural language processing techniques.",

    "summary": "Real-time streamflow monitoring networks generate millions of observations annually, yet maintaining data quality across thousands of remote sensors remains labor-intensive. We introduce HydroGEM (Hydrological Generalizable Encoder for Monitoring), a foundation model for continental-scale streamflow quality control. HydroGEM uses two-stage training: self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations learns hydrological representations, followed by fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization. The model maintains consistent detection across correction magnitudes and aligns with operational seasonal patterns. HydroGEM is designed for human-in-the-loop workflows - outputs are quality control suggestions requiring expert review, not autonomous corrections.",

    "summary": "Text-to-image retrieval in remote sensing (RS) has advanced rapidly with the rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) tailored for aerial and satellite imagery, culminating in remote sensing large vision-language models (RS-LVLMS). However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty. RUNE outperforms joint-embedding models in complex RS retrieval tasks, offering gains in performance, robustness, and explainability. We show RUNE's potential for real-world RS applications through a use case on post-flood satellite image retrieval.",

AED models trained on segmented utterances learn to encode absolute frame positions by exploiting limited acoustic context beyond segment boundaries, but fail to generalize when decoding long-form segments where these cues vanish. The model loses ability to order acoustic encodings due to permutation invariance of keys and values in cross-attention. We propose four modifications: (1) injecting explicit absolute positional encodings into cross-attention for each decoded segment, (2) long-form training with extended acoustic context to eliminate implicit absolute position encoding, (3) segment concatenation to cover diverse segmentations needed during training, and (4) semantic segmentation to align AED-decoded segments with training segments. We show these modifications close the accuracy gap between continuous and segmented acoustic encodings, enabling auto-regressive use of the attention decoder.",

    "summary": "Today, a lot of research on language models is focused on large, general-purpose models. However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.",

    "summary": "Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.\n  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models, typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing podcast narratives at scale.\n  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.",

    "summary": "The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance, but it also leads to prohibitive memory costs. Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering \"easy\" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to \"hard\" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/VersatileFFN.",

While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards.\n  To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment. Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER.

    "summary": "Forensic scientists often need to identify an unknown speaker or writer in cases such as ransom calls, covert recordings, alleged suicide notes, or anonymous online communications, among many others. Speaker recognition in the speech domain usually examines phonetic or acoustic properties of a voice, and these methods can be accurate and robust under certain conditions. However, if a speaker disguises their voice or employs text-to-speech software, vocal properties may no longer be reliable, leaving only their linguistic content available for analysis. Authorship attribution methods traditionally use syntactic, semantic, and related linguistic information to identify writers of written text (authorship attribution). In this paper, we apply a content-based authorship approach to speech that has been transcribed into text, using what a speaker says to attribute speech to individuals (speaker attribution). We introduce a stylometric method, StyloSpeaker, which incorporates character, word, token, sentence, and style features from the stylometric literature on authorship, to assess whether two transcripts were produced by the same speaker. We evaluate this method on two types of transcript formatting: one approximating prescriptive written text with capitalization and punctuation and another normalized style that removes these conventions. The transcripts' conversation topics are also controlled to varying degrees. We find generally higher attribution performance on normalized transcripts, except under the strongest topic control condition, in which overall performance is highest. Finally, we compare this more explainable stylometric model to black-box neural approaches on the same data and investigate which stylistic features most effectively distinguish speakers.",

We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.",

Large language models (LLMs) offer scalable and accessible assistance, yet their deployment in mental-health settings remains risky when their reasoning is incomplete, inconsistent, or ungrounded. Existing psychological LLMs emphasize emotional understanding or knowledge recall but overlook the step-wise, clinically aligned reasoning required for appraisal, diagnosis, intervention planning, abstraction, and verification. To address these issues, we introduce MentraSuite, a unified framework for advancing reliable mental-health reasoning. We propose MentraBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning five core reasoning aspects, six tasks, and 13 datasets, evaluating both task performance and reasoning quality across five dimensions: conciseness, coherence, hallucination avoidance, task understanding, and internal consistency. We further present Mindora, a post-trained model optimized through a hybrid SFT-RL framework with an inconsistency-detection reward to enforce faithful and coherent reasoning. To support training, we construct high-quality trajectories using a novel reasoning trajectory generation strategy, that strategically filters difficult samples and applies a structured, consistency-oriented rewriting process to produce concise, readable, and well-balanced trajectories. Across 20 evaluated LLMs, Mindora achieves the highest average performance on MentraBench and shows remarkable performances in reasoning reliability, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex mental-health scenarios.",

    "title": "Analysing Knowledge Construction in Online Learning: Adapting the Interaction Analysis Model for Unstructured Large-Scale Discourse",
    "summary": "The rapid expansion of online courses and social media has generated large volumes of unstructured learner-generated text. Understanding how learners construct knowledge in these spaces is crucial for analysing learning processes, informing content design, and providing feedback at scale. However, existing approaches typically rely on manual coding of well-structured discussion forums, which does not scale to the fragmented discourse found in online learning. This study proposes and validates a framework that combines a codebook inspired by the Interaction Analysis Model with an automated classifier to enable large-scale analysis of knowledge construction in unstructured online discourse. We adapt four comment-level categories of knowledge construction: Non-Knowledge Construction, Share, Explore, and Integrate. Three trained annotators coded a balanced sample of 20,000 comments from YouTube education channels. The codebook demonstrated strong reliability, with Cohen's kappa = 0.79 on the main dataset and 0.85--0.93 across four additional educational domains. For automated classification, bag-of-words baselines were compared with transformer-based language models using 10-fold cross-validation. A DeBERTa-v3-large model achieved the highest macro-averaged F1 score (0.841), outperforming all baselines and other transformer models. External validation on four domains yielded macro-F1 above 0.705, with stronger transfer in medicine and programming, where discourse was more structured and task-focused, and weaker transfer in language and music, where comments were more varied and context-dependent. Overall, the study shows that theory-driven, semi-automated analysis of knowledge construction at scale is feasible, enabling the integration of knowledge-construction indicators into learning analytics and the design of online learning environments.",

    "summary": "The aim of this article is to introduce two Context-Free Grammars (CFG) for Nawatl Corpora expansion. Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $π$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs.",

    "summary": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is often limited by the memory available on commodity GPUs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as QLoRA reduce the number of trainable parameters, yet still incur high memory usage induced by the backward pass in the full model. We revisit Ladder Side Tuning (LST), a rarely explored PEFT technique that adds a lightweight side network, and show that it matches QLoRA's compute scaling slope while cutting peak memory by 50\\%. Across different downstream benchmarks spanning natural language understanding, mathematical and LLM-critic tasks, LST has competitive performance with QLoRA's accuracy on average while being much more memory-efficient. This efficiency enables fine-tuning of 7B-parameter models on a single 12 GB consumer GPU with 2k-token contexts, requiring no gradient checkpointing\\textemdash conditions under which QLoRA exhausts memory. Beyond memory efficiency, we also establish scaling laws showing that LST scales similarly to QLoRA. We exploit Ladder's architectural flexibility by introducing xLadder, a depth-extended variant that increases effective depth via cross-connections and shortens chain-of-thought (CoT) at fixed parameter count. Ladder is strong when memory is the bottleneck; xLadder builds on this by enabling deeper reasoning without additional memory overhead.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in various tasks and applications. However, despite their wide capabilities, they are shown to lack cultural alignment \\citep{ryan-etal-2024-unintended, alkhamissi-etal-2024-investigating} and produce biased generations \\cite{naous-etal-2024-beer} due to a lack of cultural knowledge and competence. Evaluation of LLMs for cultural awareness and alignment is particularly challenging due to the lack of proper evaluation metrics and unavailability of culturally grounded datasets representing the vast complexity of cultures at the regional and sub-regional levels. Existing datasets for culture specific items (CSIs) focus primarily on concepts at the regional level and may contain false positives. To address this issue, we introduce a novel CSI dataset for Indian culture, belonging to 17 cultural facets. The dataset comprises ~8k cultural concepts from 36 sub-regions. To measure the cultural competence of LLMs on a cultural text adaptation task, we evaluate the adaptations using the CSIs created, LLM as Judge, and human evaluations from diverse socio-demographic region. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analysis demonstrating selective sub-regional coverage and surface-level adaptations across all considered LLMs. Our dataset is available here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nlip/DIWALI, project webpage https://nlip-lab.github.io/nlip/publications/diwali/, and our codebase with model outputs can be found here: https://github.com/pramitsahoo/culture-evaluation",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.",

Recent evaluations such as TurnBench highlight recurring failure modes-reasoning bias, task drift, hallucination, overconfidence, and memory decay. Current approaches typically append full conversational histories, causing unbounded context growth, higher computational costs, and degraded reasoning efficiency. We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn. Experiments on TurnBench show that this layered design mitigates reasoning failures, controls context growth, and improves consistency across extended reasoning chains, moving toward more reliable, human-like reasoning in LLMs.",

    "summary": "LLM serving is increasingly dominated by decode attention, which is a memory-bound operation due to massive KV cache loading from global memory. Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: one-query-per-CTA execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while one-size-fits-all tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.\n  This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 53.5% on average and TPOT by 17.0-93.1% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels.

    "title": "WaveSim: A Wavelet-based Multi-scale Similarity Metric for Weather and Climate Fields",
    "summary": "We introduce WaveSim, a multi-scale similarity metric for the evaluation of spatial fields in weather and climate applications. WaveSim exploits wavelet transforms to decompose input fields into scale-specific wavelet coefficients. The metric is built by multiplying three orthogonal components derived from these coefficients: Magnitude, which quantifies similarities in the energy distribution of the coefficients, i.e., the intensity of the field; Displacement, which captures spatial shift by comparing the centers of mass of normalized energy distributions; and Structure, which assesses pattern organization independent of location and amplitude. Each component yields a scale-specific similarity score ranging from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (perfect similarity), which are then combined across scales to produce an overall similarity measure. We first evaluate WaveSim using synthetic test cases, applying controlled spatial and temporal perturbations to systematically assess its sensitivity and expected behavior. We then demonstrate its applicability to physically relevant case studies of key modes of climate variability in Earth System Models. Traditional point-wise metrics lack a mechanism for attributing errors to physical scales or modes of dissimilarity. By operating in the wavelet domain and decomposing the signal along independent axes, WaveSim bypasses these limitations and provides an interpretable and diagnostically rich framework for assessing similarity in complex fields. Additionally, the WaveSim framework allows users to place emphasis on a specific scale or component, and lends itself to user-specific model intercomparison, model evaluation, and calibration and training of forecasting systems. We provide a PyTorch-ready implementation of WaveSim, along with all evaluation scripts, at: https://github.com/gabrieleaccarino/wavesim.",

    "summary": "CoT has significantly enhanced the reasoning ability of LLMs while it faces challenges when extended to multimodal domains, particularly in mathematical tasks. Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

Radiomic features extracted from MRI help detect tumor subtype, ensuring a more balanced training. Custom lesion-level performance metrics determine the influence of each model in the ensemble and optimize post-processing that further refines the predictions, enabling the workflow to tailor every step to each case. On the BraTS testing sets, our pipeline achieved performance comparable to top-ranked algorithms across multiple challenges. These findings confirm that custom lesion-aware processing and model selection yield robust segmentations yet without locking the method to a specific network architecture.

    "summary": "The dynamics of glaciers and ice shelf fronts significantly impact the mass balance of ice sheets and coastal sea levels. To effectively monitor glacier conditions, it is crucial to consistently estimate positional shifts of glacier calving fronts. AMD-HookNet firstly introduces a pure two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) for glacier segmentation. Yet, the local nature and translational invariance of convolution operations, while beneficial for capturing low-level details, restricts the model ability to maintain long-range dependencies. In this study, we propose AMD-HookNet++, a novel advanced hybrid CNN-Transformer feature enhancement method for segmenting glaciers and delineating calving fronts in synthetic aperture radar images. Our hybrid structure consists of two branches: a Transformer-based context branch to capture long-range dependencies, which provides global contextual information in a larger view, and a CNN-based target branch to preserve local details. To strengthen the representation of the connected hybrid features, we devise an enhanced spatial-channel attention module to foster interactions between the hybrid CNN-Transformer branches through dynamically adjusting the token relationships from both spatial and channel perspectives. Additionally, we develop a pixel-to-pixel contrastive deep supervision to optimize our hybrid model by integrating pixelwise metric learning into glacier segmentation. Through extensive experiments and comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on the challenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe, we show that AMD-HookNet++ sets a new state of the art with an IoU of 78.2 and a HD95 of 1,318 m, while maintaining a competitive MDE of 367 m. More importantly, our hybrid model produces smoother delineations of calving fronts, resolving the issue of jagged edges typically seen in pure Transformer-based approaches.",

    "summary": "Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets that allow models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to training on the full dataset. While this approach has shown promising results for image data, extending dataset distillation methods to video data has proven challenging and often leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we first identify the core challenge in video set distillation as the substantial increase in learnable parameters introduced by the temporal dimension of video, which complicates optimization and hinders convergence. To address this issue, we observe that a single frame is often sufficient to capture the discriminative semantics of a video. Leveraging this insight, we propose Single-Frame Video set Distillation (SFVD), a framework that distills videos into highly informative frames for each class. Using differentiable interpolation, these frames are transformed into video sequences and matched with the original dataset, while updates are restricted to the frames themselves for improved optimization efficiency. To further incorporate temporal information, the distilled frames are combined with sampled real videos from real videos during the matching process through a channel reshaping layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SFVD substantially outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to 5.3% on MiniUCF, thereby offering a more effective solution.",

    "summary": "This paper presents WorldPlay, a streaming video diffusion model that enables real-time, interactive world modeling with long-term geometric consistency, resolving the trade-off between speed and memory that limits current methods. WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift. Taken together, WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, comparing favorably with existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

However, these cameras tend to perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras, characterized by low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, have considerable potential to mitigate these issues. Compared to frame-based vision, there are far fewer studies on event-based vision. To address this research gap, we introduce an initial pilot dataset tailored for event-based ITS, covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. We establish a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset, achieving excellent performance.",

    "summary": "Current multimodal survival prediction methods typically rely on pathology images (WSIs) and genomic data, both of which are high-dimensional and redundant, making it difficult to extract discriminative features from them and align different modalities. Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that KEMM achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

    "summary": "Food image classification models are crucial for dietary management applications because they reduce the burden of manual meal logging. However, most publicly available datasets for training such models rely on web-crawled images, which often differ from users' real-world meal photos. In this work, we present FoodLogAthl-218, a food image dataset constructed from real-world meal records collected through the dietary management application FoodLog Athl. The dataset contains 6,925 images across 218 food categories, with a total of 14,349 bounding boxes. Rich metadata, including meal date and time, anonymized user IDs, and meal-level context, accompany each image. Unlike conventional datasets-where a predefined class set guides web-based image collection-our data begins with user-submitted photos, and labels are applied afterward. This yields greater intra-class diversity, a natural frequency distribution of meal types, and casual, unfiltered images intended for personal use rather than public sharing. In addition to (1) a standard classification benchmark, we introduce two FoodLog-specific tasks: (2) an incremental fine-tuning protocol that follows the temporal stream of users' logs, and (3) a context-aware classification task where each image contains multiple dishes, and the model must classify each dish by leveraging the overall meal context. We evaluate these tasks using large multimodal models (LMMs). The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/FoodLog/FoodLogAthl-218.",

All edit types are generated via a meticulously designed data pipeline with rigorous quality filtering. OpenVE-3M surpasses existing open-source datasets in terms of scale, diversity of edit types, instruction length, and overall quality. Furthermore, to address the lack of a unified benchmark in the field, we construct OpenVE-Bench, containing 431 video-edit pairs that cover a diverse range of editing tasks with three key metrics highly aligned with human judgment. We present OpenVE-Edit, a 5B model trained on our dataset that demonstrates remarkable efficiency and effectiveness by setting a new state-of-the-art on OpenVE-Bench, outperforming all prior open-source models including a 14B baseline.

    "summary": "Medical image registration is critical for aligning anatomical structures across imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. Among existing techniques, non-rigid registration (NRR) is particularly challenging due to the need to capture complex anatomical deformations caused by physiological processes like respiration or contrast-induced signal variations. Traditional NRR methods, while theoretically robust, often require extensive parameter tuning and incur high computational costs, limiting their use in real-time clinical workflows. Recent deep learning (DL)-based approaches have shown promise; however, their dependence on task-specific retraining restricts scalability and adaptability in practice. These limitations underscore the need for efficient, generalizable registration frameworks capable of handling heterogeneous imaging contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for 3D non-rigid registration that generalizes across multiple imaging modalities and anatomical regions. Unlike conventional methods that rely on application-specific models, our approach eliminates anatomy- or modality-specific customization, enabling streamlined integration into diverse clinical environments.",

    "summary": "Medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to recover high-quality medical images from their low-quality counterparts. Recent advancements in MedIR have focused on All-in-One models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple different MedIR tasks. However, due to significant differences in both modality and degradation types, using a shared model for these diverse tasks requires careful consideration of two critical inter-task relationships: task interference, which occurs when conflicting gradient update directions arise across tasks on the same parameter, and task imbalance, which refers to uneven optimization caused by varying learning difficulties inherent to each task. To address these challenges, we propose a task-adaptive Transformer (TAT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts to different tasks through two key innovations. First, a task-adaptive weight generation strategy is introduced to mitigate task interference by generating task-specific weight parameters for each task, thereby eliminating potential gradient conflicts on shared weight parameters. Second, a task-adaptive loss balancing strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties, preventing task domination or undertraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks--PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution--both in task-specific and All-in-One settings.

    "summary": "Recent advancements in diffusion-based technologies have made significant strides, particularly in identity-preserved portrait generation (IPG). However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control. In addition, we devise an automated pipeline to construct an ID-based dataset for training HiFi-Portrait. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA approaches in face similarity and controllability. Furthermore, our method is also compatible with previous SDXL-based works.",

    "summary": "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has achieved notable success under daytime conditions. However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime depth estimation. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.",

We introduce a novel formulation that learns object Gaussians on an underlying 2D surface manifold rather than in 3D volume, yielding sharper, fine-grained object details for dynamic object reconstruction. We further propose a contact constraint in Gaussian space that regularizes human-object relations and enables natural, physically plausible animation. Across three benchmarks - BEHAVE, NeuralDome, and DNA-Rendering - GASPACHO achieves high-quality reconstructions under heavy occlusion and supports controllable synthesis of novel human-object interactions. We also demonstrate that our method allows for composition of humans and objects in 3D scenes and for the first time showcase that neural rendering can be used for the controllable generation of photoreal humans interacting with dynamic objects in diverse scenes.

    "summary": "Recent advances in computational pathology have leveraged vision-language models to learn joint representations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images with spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles. However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.",

    "summary": "Current retinal foundation models remain constrained by curated research datasets that lack authentic clinical context, and require extensive task-specific optimization for each application, limiting their deployment efficiency in low-resource settings. Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels. These results demonstrate that clinical native intelligence can be directly extracted from clinical archives without any further annotation to build medical AI systems suited to various low-resource settings.",

    "summary": "Chest X-ray imaging is commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, but accurately localizing the pneumonia affected regions typically requires detailed pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time consuming to obtain. To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models including a Vision Transformer under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high accuracy (96-98%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V2 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations in this study confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.",

    "summary": "Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) achieves strong generalization in vision-language tasks by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space. However, recent findings show that CLIP-like models still underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, and this issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with long and detailed captions. This stems from CLIP's training objective, which optimizes only global image-text similarity and overlooks token-level supervision - limiting its ability to achieve fine-grained visual-text alignment. To address this, we propose SuperCLIP, a simple yet effective framework that augments contrastive learning with classification-based supervision. By adding only a lightweight linear layer to the vision encoder, SuperCLIP leverages token-level cues to enhance visual-textual alignment - with just a 0.077% increase in total FLOPs, and no need for additional annotated data. Experiments show that SuperCLIP consistently improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and purely visual tasks. These gains hold regardless of whether the model is trained on original web data or rich re-captioned data, demonstrating SuperCLIP's ability to recover textual supervision in both cases. Furthermore, SuperCLIP alleviates CLIP's small-batch performance drop through classification-based supervision that avoids reliance on large batch sizes. Code and models will be made open source.",

    "summary": "Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) faces persistent challenges in balancing reconstruction fidelity with cross-scenario generalization. While existing methods predominantly focus on deterministic pixel-level mappings between paired low/normal-light images, they often neglect the continuous physical process of luminance transitions in real-world environments, leading to performance drop when normal-light references are unavailable. Inspired by empirical analysis of natural luminance dynamics revealing power-law distributed intensity transitions, this paper introduces Luminance-Aware Statistical Quantification (LASQ), a novel framework that reformulates LLIE as a statistical sampling process over hierarchical luminance distributions. Our LASQ re-conceptualizes luminance transition as a power-law distribution in intensity coordinate space that can be approximated by stratified power functions, therefore, replacing deterministic mappings with probabilistic sampling over continuous luminance layers. A diffusion forward process is designed to autonomously discover optimal transition paths between luminance layers, achieving unsupervised distribution emulation without normal-light references. In this way, it considerably improves the performance in practical situations, enabling more adaptable and versatile light restoration. This framework is also readily applicable to cases with normal-light references, where it achieves superior performance on domain-specific datasets alongside better generalization-ability across non-reference datasets.",

    "summary": "Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

    "summary": "Versatile 3D tasks (e.g., generation or editing) that distill from Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have attracted significant research interest for not relying on extensive 3D training data. However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks.",

In a single monocular shot, our metalens physically embeds depth information into two polarized optical wavefronts, which we decode through a lightweight prompting and fine-tuning framework that aligns depth foundation models with the optical signals. To scale the training data, we develop a light wave propagation simulator that synthesizes metalens responses from RGB-D datasets, incorporating key physical factors to minimize the sim-to-real gap. Simulated and physical experiments with our fabricated titanium-dioxide metalens demonstrate accurate and consistent metric depth over state-of-the-art monocular depth estimators.

However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train a segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose a Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by a Temporal DropLoss. After training the final model on the resulting dense labelset, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art across various benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Video recognition systems are increasingly being deployed in daily life, such as content recommendation and security monitoring. To enhance video recognition development, many institutions have released high-quality public datasets with open-source licenses for training advanced models. At the same time, these datasets are also susceptible to misuse and infringement. Dataset copyright auditing is an effective solution to identify such unauthorized use. However, existing dataset copyright solutions primarily focus on the image domain; the complex nature of video data leaves dataset copyright auditing in the video domain unexplored. Specifically, video data introduces an additional temporal dimension, which poses significant challenges to the effectiveness and stealthiness of existing methods.\n  In this paper, we propose VICTOR, the first dataset copyright auditing approach for video recognition systems. We develop a general and stealthy sample modification strategy that enhances the output discrepancy of the target model. By modifying only a small proportion of samples (e.g., 1%), VICTOR amplifies the impact of published modified samples on the prediction behavior of the target models. Then, the difference in the model's behavior for published modified and unpublished original samples can serve as a key basis for dataset auditing. Extensive experiments on multiple models and datasets highlight the superiority of VICTOR. Finally, we show that VICTOR is robust in the presence of several perturbation mechanisms to the training videos or the target models.",

    "title": "Score-Based Turbo Message Passing for Plug-and-Play Compressive Imaging",
    "summary": "Message-passing algorithms have been adapted for compressive imaging by incorporating various off-the-shelf image denoisers. However, these denoisers rely largely on generic or hand-crafted priors and often fall short in accurately capturing the complex statistical structure of natural images. As a result, traditional plug-and-play (PnP) methods often lead to suboptimal reconstruction, especially in highly underdetermined regimes. Recently, score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for accurately characterizing sophisticated image distribution. Yet, their direct use for posterior sampling typically incurs prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, by exploiting the close connection between score-based generative modeling and empirical Bayes denoising, we devise a message-passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. The resulting algorithm, named score-based turbo message passing (STMP), combines the fast convergence of message passing with the expressive power of score-based generative priors. For practical systems with quantized measurements, we further propose quantized STMP (Q-STMP), which augments STMP with a component-wise MMSE dequantization module. We demonstrate that the asymptotic performance of STMP and Q-STMP can be accurately predicted by a set of state-evolution (SE) equations. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that STMP strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff compared with competing baselines, and that Q-STMP remains robust even under 1-bit quantization. Remarkably, both STMP and Q-STMP typically converge within 10 iterations.",

However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on third-person (exocentric) vision, overlooking the unique challenges of first-person (egocentric) videos. Additionally, high acquisition costs limit data size, impairing MLLM performance. To address these challenges, we propose learning the mapping between exocentric and egocentric domains, leveraging the extensive exocentric knowledge within existing MLLMs to enhance egocentric video understanding. To this end, we introduce Ego-ExoClip, a pre-training dataset comprising 1.1M synchronized ego-exo clip-text pairs derived from Ego-Exo4D, together with the instruction-tuning dataset EgoIT, which is collected from multiple sources to enhance the model's instruction-following capabilities. Building upon the datasets, we propose a migration strategy and further design a progressive mapping learning pipeline with three stages: Demonstrator Self-Preparation, Demonstrator-Learner Guidance, and Learner Self-Practice. Extensive experiments across diverse egocentric tasks reveal that existing MLLMs perform inadequately in egocentric video understanding, while our model significantly outperforms these leading models.",

Compared to traditional methods, INQUIRE-Search takes a fraction of the time, opening up new possibilities for scientific questions that can be explored. Through five case studies, we show the diversity of scientific applications that a tool like INQUIRE-Search can support, from seasonal variation in behavior across species to forest regrowth after wildfires.

    "summary": "Training-free image editing with large diffusion models has become practical, yet faithfully performing complex non-rigid edits (e.g., pose or shape changes) remains highly challenging. We identify a key underlying cause: attention collapse in existing attention sharing mechanisms, where either positional embeddings or semantic features dominate visual content retrieval, leading to over-editing or under-editing.To address this issue, we introduce SynPS, a method that Synergistically leverages Positional embeddings and Semantic information for faithful non-rigid image editing. We first propose an editing measurement that quantifies the required editing magnitude at each denoising step. Based on this measurement, we design an attention synergy pipeline that dynamically modulates the influence of positional embeddings, enabling SynPS to balance semantic modifications and fidelity preservation.By adaptively integrating positional and semantic cues, SynPS effectively avoids both over- and under-editing. Extensive experiments on public and newly curated benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and faithfulness of our approach.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in generative image modeling have achieved visual realism sufficient to deceive human experts, yet their potential for privacy preserving data sharing remains insufficiently understood. A central obstacle is the absence of reliable memorization detection mechanisms, limited quantitative evaluation, and poor generalization of existing privacy auditing methods across domains. To address this, we propose to view memorization detection as a unified problem at the intersection of re-identification and copy detection, whose complementary goals cover both identity consistency and augmentation-robust duplication, and introduce Latent Contrastive Memorization Network (LCMem), a cross-domain model evaluated jointly on both tasks. LCMem achieves this through a two-stage training strategy that first learns identity consistency before incorporating augmentation-robust copy detection. Across six benchmark datasets, LCMem achieves improvements of up to 16 percentage points on re-identification and 30 percentage points on copy detection, enabling substantially more reliable memorization detection at scale. Our results show that existing privacy filters provide limited performance and robustness, highlighting the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We show that LCMem sets a new standard for cross-domain privacy auditing, offering reliable and scalable memorization detection.

    "summary": "Light-weight neural networks for remote sensing (RS) visual analysis must overcome two inherent redundancies: spatial redundancy from vast, homogeneous backgrounds, and channel redundancy, where extreme scale variations render a single feature space inefficient. Existing models, often designed for natural images, fail to address this dual challenge in RS scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose LWGANet, a light-weight backbone engineered for RS-specific properties. LWGANet introduces two core innovations: a Top-K Global Feature Interaction (TGFI) module that mitigates spatial redundancy by focusing computation on salient regions, and a Light-Weight Grouped Attention (LWGA) module that resolves channel redundancy by partitioning channels into specialized, scale-specific pathways. By synergistically resolving these core inefficiencies, LWGANet achieves a superior trade-off between feature representation quality and computational cost. Extensive experiments on twelve diverse datasets across four major RS tasks--scene classification, oriented object detection, semantic segmentation, and change detection--demonstrate that LWGANet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art light-weight backbones in both accuracy and efficiency. Our work establishes a new, robust baseline for efficient visual analysis in RS images.",

    "summary": "Diffusion models have demonstrated significant applications in the field of image generation. However, their high computational and memory costs pose challenges for deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising solution to reduce storage overhead and accelerate inference. Nevertheless, existing quantization methods for diffusion models struggle to mitigate outliers in activation matrices during inference, leading to substantial performance degradation under low-bit quantization scenarios. To address this, we propose HQ-DM, a novel Quantization-Aware Training framework that applies Single Hadamard Transformation to activation matrices. This approach effectively reduces activation outliers while preserving model performance under quantization. Compared to traditional Double Hadamard Transformation, our proposed scheme offers distinct advantages by seamlessly supporting INT convolution operations while preventing the amplification of weight outliers. For conditional generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset using the LDM-4 model, our W4A4 and W4A3 quantization schemes improve the Inception Score by 12.8% and 467.73%, respectively, over the existing state-of-the-art method.",

This has directed research efforts towards architectural interventions, such as coordinate embeddings or specialized activation functions, to represent high-frequency signals. In this paper, we challenge the notion that the low-frequency bias of vanilla MLPs is an intrinsic, architectural limitation to learn high-frequency content, but instead a symptom of stable rank degradation during training. We empirically demonstrate that regulating the network's rank during training substantially improves the fidelity of the learned signal, rendering even simple MLP architectures expressive. Extensive experiments show that using optimizers like Muon, with high-rank, near-orthogonal updates, consistently enhances INR architectures even beyond simple ReLU MLPs. These substantial improvements hold across a diverse range of domains, including natural and medical images, and novel view synthesis, with up to 9 dB PSNR improvements over the previous state-of-the-art.

    "summary": "The human visual system is remarkably adept at adapting to changes in the input distribution; a capability modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) still struggle to match. Drawing inspiration from the developmental trajectory of human vision, we propose a progressive blurring curriculum to improve the generalization and robustness of CNNs. Human infants are born with poor visual acuity, gradually refining their ability to perceive fine details. Mimicking this process, we begin training CNNs on highly blurred images during the initial epochs and progressively reduce the blur as training advances. This approach encourages the network to prioritize global structures over high-frequency artifacts, improving robustness against distribution shifts and noisy inputs. Challenging prior claims that blurring in the initial training epochs imposes a stimulus deficit and irreversibly harms model performance, we reveal that early-stage blurring enhances generalization with minimal impact on in-domain accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed curriculum reduces mean corruption error (mCE) by up to 8.30% on CIFAR-10-C and 4.43% on ImageNet-100-C datasets, compared to standard training without blurring. Unlike static blur-based augmentation, which applies blurred images randomly throughout training, our method follows a structured progression, yielding consistent gains across various datasets. Furthermore, our approach complements other augmentation techniques, such as CutMix and MixUp, and enhances both natural and adversarial robustness against common attack methods.

    "summary": "Dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) is essential for creating immersive experiences. Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces model size by up to 98% and achieves real-time rendering at up to 125 FPS at 4K resolution on a single RTX 3090 GPU. It further sustains 160 FPS at 1352 * 1014 on an RTX 3050 and has been integrated into the VR system. Moreover, HGS achieves comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods while providing significantly improved visual fidelity for high-frequency details and abrupt scene changes.",

    "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details. We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.",

    "summary": "We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of 765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking, which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations. Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects, spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35 DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data. The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.",

    "summary": "Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are central to modern web design, and the demand to animate them continues to grow as web environments become increasingly dynamic. Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches, suggesting that semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.",

However, most existing frameworks focus on global alignment and struggle to capture the hierarchical, multi-scale lesion patterns characteristic of plant disease imagery. To address this gap, we propose PSMamba, a progressive self-supervised framework that integrates the efficient sequence modelling of Vision Mamba (VM) with a dual-student hierarchical distillation strategy. Unlike conventional single teacher-student designs, PSMamba employs a shared global teacher and two specialised students: one processes mid-scale views to capture lesion distributions and vein structures, while the other focuses on local views to capture fine-grained cues such as texture irregularities and early-stage lesions. This multi-granular supervision facilitates the joint learning of contextual and detailed representations, with consistency losses ensuring coherent cross-scale alignment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that PSMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in both domain-shifted and fine-grained scenarios.",

While this marks the first integration of language-level concepts within the SAM family, real-world usage typically requires far richer expressions that include attributes, spatial relations, functionalities, actions, states, and even implicit reasoning over instances. Currently, SAM3 relies on external multi-modal agents to convert complex instructions into NPs and then conduct iterative mask filtering. However, these NP-level concepts remain overly coarse, often failing to precisely represent a specific instance. In this work, we present SAM3-I, an enhanced framework that unifies concept-level understanding and instruction-level reasoning within the SAM family. SAM3-I introduces an instruction-aware cascaded adaptation mechanism that progressively aligns expressive instruction semantics with SAM3's existing vision-language representations, enabling direct instruction-following segmentation without sacrificing its original concept-driven capabilities. Furthermore, we design a structured instruction taxonomy spanning concept, simple, and complex levels, and develop a scalable data engine to construct a dataset with diverse instruction-mask pairs. Experiments show that SAM3-I delivers appealing performance, demonstrating that SAM3 can be effectively extended to follow natural-language instructions while preserving its strong concept grounding. We open-source SAM3-I and provide practical fine-tuning workflows, enabling researchers to adapt it to domain-specific applications. The source code is available here.",

    "summary": "Stroke is a major public health problem, affecting millions worldwide. Deep learning has recently demonstrated promise for enhancing the diagnosis and risk prediction of stroke. However, existing methods rely on costly medical imaging modalities, such as computed tomography. Recent studies suggest that retinal imaging could offer a cost-effective alternative for cerebrovascular health assessment due to the shared clinical pathways between the retina and the brain. Hence, this study explores the impact of leveraging retinal images and clinical data for stroke detection and risk prediction. We propose a multimodal deep neural network that processes Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and infrared reflectance retinal scans, combined with clinical data, such as demographics, vital signs, and diagnosis codes. We pretrained our model using a self-supervised learning framework using a real-world dataset consisting of $37$ k scans, and then fine-tuned and evaluated the model using a smaller labeled subset. Our empirical findings establish the predictive ability of the considered modalities in detecting lasting effects in the retina associated with acute stroke and forecasting future risk within a specific time horizon. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by achieving $5$\\% AUROC improvement as compared to the unimodal image-only baseline, and $8$\\% improvement compared to an existing state-of-the-art foundation model. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of retinal imaging in identifying high-risk patients and improving long-term outcomes.",

    "summary": "Transferring 2D textures to 3D modalities is of great significance for improving the efficiency of multimedia content creation. Existing approaches have rarely focused on transferring image textures onto 3D representations. 3D style transfer methods are capable of transferring abstract artistic styles to 3D scenes. However, these methods often overlook the geometric information of the scene, which makes it challenging to achieve high-quality 3D texture transfer results. In this paper, we present GT^2-GS, a geometry-aware texture transfer framework for gaussian splitting. From the perspective of matching texture features with geometric information in rendered views, we identify the issue of insufficient texture features and propose a geometry-aware texture augmentation module to expand the texture feature set. Moreover, a geometry-consistent texture loss is proposed to optimize texture features into the scene representation. This loss function incorporates both camera pose and 3D geometric information of the scene, enabling controllable texture-oriented appearance editing. Finally, a geometry preservation strategy is introduced. By alternating between the texture transfer and geometry correction stages over multiple iterations, this strategy achieves a balance between learning texture features and preserving geometric integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our method. Through geometric awareness, our approach achieves texture transfer results that better align with human visual perception. Our homepage is available at https://vpx-ecnu.github.io/GT2-GS-website.",

In this work, we present Zoom-Zero, a coarse-to-fine framework that first localizes query-relevant segments and then temporally zooms into the most salient frames for finer-grained visual verification. Our method addresses the limits of GRPO for the GVQA task with two key innovations: (i) a zoom-in accuracy reward that validates the fidelity of temporal grounding prediction and facilitates fine-grained visual verification on grounded frames; (ii) token-selective credit assignment, which attributes rewards to the tokens responsible for temporal localization or answer generation, mitigating GRPO's issue in handling multi-faceted reward signals.

    "summary": "Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.",

    "summary": "Recently, Visual Programming (VP) based on large language models (LLMs) has rapidly developed and demonstrated significant potential in complex Visual Reasoning (VR) tasks. Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our EVPG, showing significant performance improvements for VP on three classical complex VR tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images.",

    "summary": "Recovering high-fidelity 3D images from sparse or degraded 2D images is a fundamental challenge in medical imaging, with broad applications ranging from 3D ultrasound reconstruction to MRI super-resolution. In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \\textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\\mathbfΣ_{obs} = \\mathbfΣ_{HR} + \\mathbfΣ_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\\times$--10$\\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data.

    "title": "A Unified Framework with Multimodal Fine-tuning for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation",
    "summary": "Multimodal remote sensing data, acquired from diverse sensors, offer a comprehensive and integrated perspective of the Earth's surface. Leveraging multimodal fusion techniques, semantic segmentation enables detailed and accurate analysis of geographic scenes, surpassing single-modality approaches. Building on advancements in vision foundation models, particularly the Segment Anything Model (SAM), this study proposes a unified framework incorporating a novel Multimodal Fine-tuning Network (MFNet) for remote sensing semantic segmentation. The proposed framework is designed to seamlessly integrate with various fine-tuning mechanisms, demonstrated through the inclusion of Adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as representative examples. This extensibility ensures the framework's adaptability to other emerging fine-tuning strategies, allowing models to retain SAM's general knowledge while effectively leveraging multimodal data. Additionally, a pyramid-based Deep Fusion Module (DFM) is introduced to integrate high-level geographic features across multiple scales, enhancing feature representation prior to decoding. This work also highlights SAM's robust generalization capabilities with Digital Surface Model (DSM) data, a novel application. Extensive experiments on three benchmark multimodal remote sensing datasets, ISPRS Vaihingen, ISPRS Potsdam and MMHunan, demonstrate that the proposed MFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in multimodal semantic segmentation, setting a new standard in the field while offering a versatile foundation for future research and applications.

    "summary": "Comprehensive perception of the vehicle's environment and correct interpretation of the environment are crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. The perception of surrounding objects is the main component for further tasks such as trajectory planning. However, safe trajectory planning requires not only object detection, but also the detection of drivable areas and lane corridors. While first approaches consider an advanced safety evaluation of object detection, the evaluation of lane detection still lacks sufficient safety metrics. Similar to the safety metrics for object detection, additional factors such as the semantics of the scene with road type and road width, the detection range as well as the potential causes of missing detections, incorporated by vehicle speed, should be considered for the evaluation of lane detection. Therefore, we propose the Lane Safety Metric (LSM), which takes these factors into account and allows to evaluate the safety of lane detection systems by determining an easily interpretable safety score. We evaluate our offline safety metric on various virtual scenarios using different lane detection approaches and compare it with state-of-the-art performance metrics.",

Moreover, our method gives the user control over the strength of the stereo effect (more precisely, the disparity range) at inference time, via an intuitive, scalar tuning knob.

    "summary": "Automotive radar has shown promising developments in environment perception due to its cost-effectiveness and robustness in adverse weather conditions. However, the limited availability of annotated radar data poses a significant challenge for advancing radar-based perception systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework to generate 4D radar point clouds for training and evaluating object detectors. Unlike image-based diffusion, our method is designed to consider the sparsity and unique characteristics of radar point clouds by applying diffusion to a latent point cloud representation. Within this latent space, generation is controlled via conditioning at either the object or scene level. The proposed 4D-RaDiff converts unlabeled bounding boxes into high-quality radar annotations and transforms existing LiDAR point cloud data into realistic radar scenes. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating synthetic radar data of 4D-RaDiff as data augmentation method during training consistently improves object detection performance compared to training on real data only. In addition, pre-training on our synthetic data reduces the amount of required annotated radar data by up to 90% while achieving comparable object detection performance.",

    "title": "ViBES: A Conversational Agent with Behaviorally-Intelligent 3D Virtual Body",
    "summary": "Human communication is inherently multimodal and social: words, prosody, and body language jointly carry intent. Yet most prior systems model human behavior as a translation task co-speech gesture or text-to-motion that maps a fixed utterance to motion clips-without requiring agentic decision-making about when to move, what to do, or how to adapt across multi-turn dialogue. This leads to brittle timing, weak social grounding, and fragmented stacks where speech, text, and motion are trained or inferred in isolation. We introduce ViBES (Voice in Behavioral Expression and Synchrony), a conversational 3D agent that jointly plans language and movement and executes dialogue-conditioned body actions. Concretely, ViBES is a speech-language-behavior (SLB) model with a mixture-of-modality-experts (MoME) backbone: modality-partitioned transformer experts for speech, facial expression, and body motion. The model processes interleaved multimodal token streams with hard routing by modality (parameters are split per expert), while sharing information through cross-expert attention. By leveraging strong pretrained speech-language models, the agent supports mixed-initiative interaction: users can speak, type, or issue body-action directives mid-conversation, and the system exposes controllable behavior hooks for streaming responses. We further benchmark on multi-turn conversation with automatic metrics of dialogue-motion alignment and behavior quality, and observe consistent gains over strong co-speech and text-to-motion baselines. ViBES goes beyond \"speech-conditioned motion generation\" toward agentic virtual bodies where language, prosody, and movement are jointly generated, enabling controllable, socially competent 3D interaction.

Currently, confirmation of MGMT promoter methylation relies on invasive brain tumor tissue biopsies. In this study, we explore radiogenomics techniques, a promising approach in precision medicine, to identify genetic markers from medical images. Using MRI scans and deep learning models, we propose a new multi-view approach that considers spatial relationships between MRI views to detect MGMT methylation status. Importantly, our method extracts information from all three views without using a complicated 3D deep learning model, avoiding issues associated with high parameter count, slow convergence, and substantial memory demands. We also introduce a new technique for tumor slice extraction and show its superiority over existing methods based on multiple evaluation metrics. By comparing our approach to state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Furthermore, we share a reproducible pipeline of published models, encouraging transparency and the development of robust diagnostic tools. Our study highlights the potential of non-invasive methods for identifying MGMT promoter methylation and contributes to advancing precision medicine in GBM treatment.",

    "title": "Why Does Little Robustness Help? A Further Step Towards Understanding Adversarial Transferability",
    "summary": "Adversarial examples (AEs) for DNNs have been shown to be transferable: AEs that successfully fool white-box surrogate models can also deceive other black-box models with different architectures. Although a bunch of empirical studies have provided guidance on generating highly transferable AEs, many of these findings lack explanations and even lead to inconsistent advice. In this paper, we take a further step towards understanding adversarial transferability, with a particular focus on surrogate aspects. Starting from the intriguing little robustness phenomenon, where models adversarially trained with mildly perturbed adversarial samples can serve as better surrogates, we attribute it to a trade-off between two predominant factors: model smoothness and gradient similarity. Our investigations focus on their joint effects, rather than their separate correlations with transferability. Through a series of theoretical and empirical analyses, we conjecture that the data distribution shift in adversarial training explains the degradation of gradient similarity. Building on these insights, we explore the impacts of data augmentation and gradient regularization on transferability and identify that the trade-off generally exists in the various training mechanisms, thus building a comprehensive blueprint for the regulation mechanism behind transferability. Finally, we provide a general route for constructing better surrogates to boost transferability which optimizes both model smoothness and gradient similarity simultaneously, e.g., the combination of input gradient regularization and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), validated by extensive experiments. In summary, we call for attention to the united impacts of these two factors for launching effective transfer attacks, rather than optimizing one while ignoring the other, and emphasize the crucial role of manipulating surrogate models.",

    "summary": "Concept erasure, which fine-tunes diffusion models to remove undesired or harmful visual concepts, has become a mainstream approach to mitigating unsafe or illegal image generation in text-to-image models.However, existing removal methods typically adopt a unidirectional erasure strategy by either suppressing the target concept or reinforcing safe alternatives, making it difficult to achieve a balanced trade-off between concept removal and generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity.",

While successful navigation demands both global environmental reasoning and local scene comprehension, existing UAV agents typically adopt mono-granularity frameworks that struggle to balance these two aspects. To address this limitation, this work proposes a History-Enhanced Two-Stage Transformer (HETT) framework, which integrates the two aspects through a coarse-to-fine navigation pipeline. Specifically, HETT first predicts coarse-grained target positions by fusing spatial landmarks and historical context, then refines actions via fine-grained visual analysis. In addition, a historical grid map is designed to dynamically aggregate visual features into a structured spatial memory, enhancing comprehensive scene awareness. Additionally, the CityNav dataset annotations are manually refined to enhance data quality. Experiments on the refined CityNav dataset show that HETT delivers significant performance gains, while extensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each component.",

Prior AIGC detection benchmarks mostly evaluate video without audio, target broad narrative domains, and focus on classification solely.

However, real-world large-scale captures are often based on multi-temporal data capture, where illumination inconsistencies across different times of day can significantly lead to color artifacts, geometric inaccuracies, and inconsistent appearance. Due to the lack of UAV datasets that systematically capture the same areas under varying illumination conditions, this challenge remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduceSkyLume, a large-scale, real-world UAV dataset specifically designed for studying illumination robust 3D reconstruction in urban scene modeling: (1) We collect data from 10 urban regions data comprising more than 100k high resolution UAV images (four oblique views and nadir), where each region is captured at three periods of the day to systematically isolate illumination changes. (2) To support precise evaluation of geometry and appearance, we provide per-scene LiDAR scans and accurate 3D ground-truth for assessing depth, surface normals, and reconstruction quality under varying illumination. (3) For the inverse rendering task, we introduce the Temporal Consistency Coefficient (TCC), a metric that measuress cross-time albedo stability and directly evaluates the robustness of the disentanglement of light and material. We aim for this resource to serve as a foundation that advances research and real-world evaluation in large-scale inverse rendering, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis.",

This approach enables the use of public datasets and reformulates the global multilabel task into a local multiclass one, improving the average F1 score by $7.89\\,\\%$. However, performance declines when using imperfect fracture detectors, highlighting challenges for real-world deployment. Our code is available on GitHub.",

    "summary": "Deep neural networks for semantic segmentation rely on large-scale annotated datasets, leading to an annotation bottleneck that motivates few shot semantic segmentation (FSS) which aims to generalize to novel classes with minimal labeled exemplars. Most existing FSS methods adopt a prototype-based paradigm, which generates query prior map by extracting masked-area features from support images and then makes predictions guided by the prior map. However, they suffer from two critical limitations induced by inter- and intra-image discrepancies: 1) The intra-class gap between support and query images, caused by single-prototype representation, results in scattered and noisy prior maps; 2) The inter-class interference from visually similar but semantically distinct regions leads to inconsistent support-query feature matching and erroneous predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Inter- and Intra-image Refinement (IIR) model. The model contains an inter-image class activation mapping based method that generates two prototypes for class-consistent region matching, including core discriminative features and local specific features, and yields an accurate and robust prior map. For intra-image refinement, a directional dropout mechanism is introduced to mask inconsistent support-query feature pairs in cross attention, thereby enhancing decoder performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on 9 benchmarks, covering standard FSS, part FSS, and cross-domain FSS.

    "summary": "Task-based measures of image quality (IQ) are critical for evaluating medical imaging systems, which must account for randomness including anatomical variability. Stochastic object models (SOMs) provide a statistical description of such variability, but conventional mathematical SOMs fail to capture realistic anatomy, while data-driven approaches typically require clean data rarely available in clinical tasks. To address this challenge, we propose AMID, an unsupervised Ambient Measurement-Integrated Diffusion with noise decoupling, which establishes clean SOMs directly from noisy measurements. AMID introduces a measurement-integrated strategy aligning measurement noise with the diffusion trajectory, and explicitly models coupling between measurement and diffusion noise across steps, an ambient loss is thus designed base on it to learn clean SOMs. Experiments on real CT and mammography datasets show that AMID outperforms existing methods in generation fidelity and yields more reliable task-based IQ evaluation, demonstrating its potential for unsupervised medical imaging analysis.",

    "summary": "Radiance field methods (e.g. 3D Gaussian Splatting) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet their appearance modeling often relies on Spherical Harmonics (SH), which impose fundamental limitations. SH struggle with high-frequency signals, exhibit Gibbs ringing artifacts, and fail to capture specular reflections - a key component of realistic rendering. Although alternatives like spherical Gaussians offer improvements, they add significant optimization complexity. We propose Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, providing an intuitive and stable parameterization for view-dependent effects. For diffuse appearance, SV achieves competitive results while keeping optimization simpler than existing alternatives. For reflections - where SH fail - we leverage SV as learnable reflection probes, taking reflected directions as input following principles from classical graphics. This formulation attains state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that SV offers a principled, efficient, and general solution for appearance modeling in explicit 3D representations.",

    "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often produce plausible but unreliable outputs, making robust uncertainty estimation essential. Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum. This spectral representation is then fed into a Gaussian Process Classifier that learns to map patterns of semantic consistency to predictive uncertainty, and that can be applied in both black-box and white-box settings. Across six LLMs and LVLMs on eight datasets spanning VQA, image classification, and textual QA, SGPU consistently achieves state-of-the-art calibration (ECE) and discriminative (AUROC, AUARC) performance. We further show that SGPU transfers across models and modalities, indicating that its spectral representation captures general patterns of semantic uncertainty.",

    "summary": "Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of deep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for detecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations, particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection models.

    "summary": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance across diverse video understanding tasks. However, their viewpoint invariant training limits their ability to understand egocentric properties (e.g., human object interactions) from exocentric video observations. This limitation is critical for many applications, such as Activities of Daily Living (ADL) monitoring, where the understanding of egocentric properties is essential, and egocentric cameras are impractical to deploy. To address this limitation, we propose Ego2ExoVLM, a VLM that learns to infer egocentric properties from exocentric videos by leveraging time-synchronized ego-exo videos during training. Ego2ExoVLM accomplishes this through the use of two components: Ego2Exo Sequence Distillation, which transfers knowledge from an egocentric teacher to an exocentric student, and Ego Adaptive Visual Tokens, designed to enhance the effectiveness of this knowledge transfer. To measure this capability, we introduce Ego-in-Exo Perception, a benchmark of 3.9K questions curated to explicitly measure the understanding of egocentric properties from exocentric videos. Ego2ExoVLM is evaluated on 10 tasks across Ego-in-Exo Perception and existing ADL benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the ADL-X benchmark suite and outperforming strong baselines on our proposed benchmark.

    "summary": "Recent approaches for monocular 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) have achieved leading performance by directly regressing 3D poses from 2D keypoint sequences. Despite the rapid progress in 3D HPE, existing methods are typically trained and evaluated under disparate frameworks, lacking a unified framework for fair comparison. To address these limitations, we propose Fast3DHPE, a modular framework that facilitates rapid reproduction and flexible development of new methods. By standardizing training and evaluation protocols, Fast3DHPE enables fair comparison across 3D human pose estimation methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this framework, we introduce FastDDHPose, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method which leverages the strong latent distribution modeling capability of diffusion models to explicitly model the distributions of bone length and bone direction while avoiding further amplification of hierarchical error accumulation. Moreover, we design an efficient Kinematic-Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser that encourages the model to focus on kinematic joint hierarchies while avoiding unnecessary modeling of overly complex joint topologies. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that the Fast3DHPE framework enables fair comparison of all methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this unified framework, FastDDHPose achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization and robustness in in-the-wild scenarios.

To extract discriminative representations from the limited labeled set, existing methods have constructed prototypes using algorithms such as farthest point sampling (FPS). However, we point out that this convention has undesirable effects as performance fluctuates depending on sampling, while the prototype generation process remains underexplored in the field. This motivates us to investigate an advanced prototype generation method based on attention mechanism. Despite its potential, we found that vanilla attention module suffers from the distributional gap between prototypical tokens and support features. To overcome this, we propose White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM), which resolves the misalignment by sandwiching cross-attention between whitening and coloring transformations. Specifically, whitening aligns the features to tokens before the attention process, and coloring subsequently restores the original distribution to the attended tokens. This simple yet effective design enables robust attention, thereby generating prototypes that capture the semantic relationships in support features. WARM achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significant margin on FS-PCS benchmarks, and demonstrates its effectiveness through extensive experiments.",

    "summary": "Object detection models deployed in real-world applications such as autonomous driving face serious threats from backdoor attacks. Despite their practical effectiveness,existing methods are inherently limited in both capability and robustness due to their dependence on single-trigger-single-object mappings and fragile pixel-level cues. We propose CIS-BA, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that redefines trigger design by shifting from static object features to continuous inter-object interaction patterns that describe how objects co-occur and interact in a scene. By modeling these patterns as a continuous interaction space, CIS-BA introduces space triggers that, for the first time, enable a multi-trigger-multi-object attack mechanism while achieving robustness through invariant geometric relations. To implement this paradigm, we design CIS-Frame, which constructs space triggers via interaction analysis, formalizes them as class-geometry constraints for sample poisoning, and embeds the backdoor during detector training. CIS-Frame supports both single-object attacks (object misclassification and disappearance) and multi-object simultaneous attacks, enabling complex and coordinated effects across diverse interaction states. Experiments on MS-COCO and real-world videos show that CIS-BA achieves over 97% attack success under complex environments and maintains over 95% effectiveness under dynamic multi-trigger conditions, while evading three state-of-the-art defenses. In summary, CIS-BA extends the landscape of backdoor attacks in interaction-intensive scenarios and provides new insights into the security of object detection systems.",

Specifically, for the latent space, we propose a transparency-aware bidirectional diffusion loss during VAE training, which shifts the RGB-A distribution according to likelihood. For the noise space, we propose shifting the mean of diffusion noise sampling and applying a Gaussian ellipse mask to provide transparency guidance and controllability. Additionally, we construct a high-quality RGB-A video dataset.

    "summary": "We address image-to-video generation with explicit user control over the final frame's disoccluded regions. Current image-to-video pipelines produce plausible motion but struggle to generate predictable, articulated motions while enforcing user-specified content in newly revealed areas. Our key idea is to separate motion specification from appearance synthesis: we introduce a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically yet approximately drives part motion, while a frozen diffusion prior is used to synthesize plausible appearance that follows that motion. In our training-free pipeline, the user loosely annotates and reposes a PDG, from which we compute a dense motion flow to leverage diffusion as a motion-guided shader. We then let the user edit appearance in the disoccluded areas of the image, and exploit the visibility information encoded by the PDG to perform a latent-space composite that reconciles motion with user intent in these areas. This design yields controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning. We demonstrate clear advantages against state-of-the-art alternatives towards images turned into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables. Our method mixes generative control, in the form of loose pose and structure, with predictable controls, in the form of appearance specification in the final frame in the disoccluded regions, unlocking a new image-to-video workflow.

Building on this data, SketchAssist employs a unified sketch editing framework with minimal changes to DiT-based editors. We repurpose the RGB channels to encode the inputs, enabling seamless switching between instruction-guided edits and line-guided redrawing within a single input interface. To further specialize behavior across modes, we integrate a task-guided mixture-of-experts into LoRA layers, routing by text and visual cues to improve semantic controllability, structural fidelity, and style preservation. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on both tasks, with superior instruction adherence and style/structure preservation compared to recent baselines.

By computing an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by target text embeddings and projecting these directions, we dramatically reduce the alignment between image features and undesired classes. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that rely on iterative fine-tuning and extensive data curation, our approach is both computationally efficient and surgically precise. This leads to a pronounced drop in zero-shot performance for the target classes while preserving the overall multimodal knowledge of the model. Our experiments demonstrate that even a partial projection can balance between complete unlearning and retaining useful information, addressing key challenges in model decontamination and privacy preservation.",

    "summary": "Dynamic 3D (4D) content generation, particularly text-to-4D, remains a challenging and under-explored problem due to its inherent spatiotemporal complexity. Existing text-to-4D methods typically avoid direct mesh generation due to inherent topological constraints, favoring alternative representations like NeRFs or 3DGS. However, these non-mesh approaches, suffer from insufficient geometric fidelity, temporal artifacts, and limited compatibility with modern computer graphics (CG) pipelines. In contrast, directly generating dynamic meshes faces two key challenges: i) deformation inflexibility, as traditional vertex-based optimization is constrained by meshes' explicitly encoded topology, and ii) semantic inconsistency, arising from stochastic noise in distilled priors.\n  In this paper, we introduce TextMesh4D, a pioneering framework for text-to-4D mesh generation that directly addresses these challenges. TextMesh4D features two core innovations: 1) the Jacobian Deformation Field (JDF), which shifts the deformation unit from vertices to faces, using per-face Jacobians to model flexible transformations free from topological constraints. 2) the Local-Global Semantic Regularizer (LGSR), which leverages the mesh's innate geometric properties to enforce semantic coherence both locally and globally across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in temporal consistency, structural fidelity, and visual realism, while requiring only a single 24GB GPU. Our work establishes a new benchmark for efficient and high-quality text-to-4D mesh generation. The code will be released to facilitate future research.",

To realize this, we introduce a novel instance-embedded representation based on deformable 3D Gaussians, which jointly encode radiance and semantic information and are learned directly from input RGB images and instance masks through differentiable rasterization. Furthermore, we introduce new mechanisms to calibrate per-Gaussian identities and resample Gaussians toward semantically active regions, ensuring consistent instance representations across space and time. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on novel-view panoptic segmentation and open-vocabulary 4D querying tasks.",

    "summary": "Document image enhancement and binarization are commonly performed prior to document analysis and recognition tasks for improving the efficiency and accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) systems. This is because directly recognizing text in degraded documents, particularly in color images, often results in unsatisfactory recognition performance. To address these issues, existing methods train independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for different color channels to remove shadows and noise, which, in turn, facilitates efficient text information extraction. However, deploying multiple GANs results in long training and inference times. To reduce both training and inference times of document image enhancement and binarization models, we propose MFE-GAN, an efficient GAN-based framework with multi-scale feature extraction (MFE), which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation (HWT) and normalization to process document images before feeding them into GANs for training. In addition, we present novel generators, discriminators, and loss functions to improve the model's performance, and we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate their effectiveness. Experimental results on the Benchmark, Nabuco, and CMATERdb datasets demonstrate that the proposed MFE-GAN significantly reduces the total training and inference times while maintaining comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The implementation of this work is available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/MFE-GAN.",

    "summary": "Pretrained models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification capabilities across diverse visual domains, spanning natural images, artistic renderings, and abstract representations. However, real-world applications often demand the removal (or \"unlearning\") of specific object classes without requiring additional data or retraining, or affecting the model's performance on unrelated tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel training- and data-free unlearning framework that enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: (1) global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, (2) domain-specific knowledge removal (e.g., eliminating sketch representations while preserving photo recognition), and (3) complete unlearning in selective domains. By leveraging a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space, our method efficiently removes undesired class information while preserving the remaining knowledge. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing retraining-based methods and offers a flexible and computationally efficient solution for controlled model forgetting.",

    "summary": "Vision-language models enable the understanding and reasoning of complex traffic scenarios through multi-source information fusion, establishing it as a core technology for autonomous driving. However, existing vision-language models are constrained by the image understanding paradigm in 2D plane, which restricts their capability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex autonomous driving environments. This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA. MMDrive effectively breaks the traditional image-only understanding barrier, enabling robust multimodal reasoning in complex driving environments and providing a new foundation for interpretable autonomous driving scene understanding.",

    "summary": "The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of 0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a powerful \"super-expert\" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for developing more effective science-based agentic systems.",

    "summary": "Multi-view image generation from a single image and text description remains challenging due to the difficulty of maintaining geometric consistency across different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically rely on 3D-aware architectures or specialized diffusion models that require extensive multi-view training data and complex geometric priors. In this work, we introduce ViewMask-1-to-3, a pioneering approach to apply discrete diffusion models to multi-view image generation. Unlike continuous diffusion methods that operate in latent spaces, ViewMask-1-to-3 formulates multi-view synthesis as a discrete sequence modeling problem, where each viewpoint is represented as visual tokens obtained through MAGVIT-v2 tokenization. By unifying language and vision through masked token prediction, our approach enables progressive generation of multiple viewpoints through iterative token unmasking with text input. ViewMask-1-to-3 achieves cross-view consistency through simple random masking combined with self-attention, eliminating the requirement for complex 3D geometric constraints or specialized attention architectures. Our approach demonstrates that discrete diffusion provides a viable and simple alternative to existing multi-view generation methods, ranking first on average across GSO and 3D-FUTURE datasets in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, while maintaining architectural simplicity.",

    "summary": "Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-quality image generation, yet their computational expense remains substantial due to iterative denoising. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes. Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block, maintaining caching effectiveness under variable guidance. Experiments demonstrate that OUSAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, achieving 53% computational savings with 15% quality improvement on DiT-XL/2 (ImageNet 512x512), 60% savings with 16.1% improvement on PixArt-alpha (MSCOCO), and 5x speedup on FLUX while improving CLIP Score over the 50-step baseline.",

    "summary": "Despite significant progress in text-driven 4D human-object interaction (HOI) generation with supervised methods, the scalability remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. To overcome this, recent approaches attempt zero-shot 4D HOI generation with pre-trained image diffusion models. However, interaction cues are minimally distilled during the generation process, restricting their applicability across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnchorHOI, a novel framework that thoroughly exploits hybrid priors by incorporating video diffusion models beyond image diffusion models, advancing 4D HOI generation. Nevertheless, directly optimizing high-dimensional 4D HOI with such priors remains challenging, particularly for human pose and compositional motion. To address this challenge, AnchorHOI introduces an anchor-based prior distillation strategy, which constructs interaction-aware anchors and then leverages them to guide generation in a tractable two-step process. Specifically, two tailored anchors are designed for 4D HOI generation: anchor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for expressive interaction composition, and anchor keypoints for realistic motion synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorHOI outperforms previous methods with superior diversity and generalization.",

Segment-level quality indices are then used to train machine learning models that predict accuracy or select the most reliable signal. This enables adaptive signal fusion and quality-based segment filtering. Experiments on three public datasets (OMuSense-23, COHFACE, MAHNOB-HCI) show that the proposed framework achieves lower RR estimation errors than individual methods in most cases, with performance gains depending on dataset characteristics.

Specifically, we propose a novel Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition (Wi-CBR), which constructs a dual-branch self-attention module that captures temporal features from phase information reflecting dynamic path length variations while extracting kinematic features from DFS correlated with motion velocity. Moreover, we design a Saliency Guidance Module that employs group attention mechanisms to mine critical activity features and utilizes gating mechanisms to optimize information entropy, facilitating feature fusion and enabling effective interaction between salient and non-salient behavioral characteristics.

To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter. Experiments show that ParaFormer achieves consistent performance improvements across both node classification and graph classification tasks on 11 datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes, validating its efficacy.

Because causal ground truth is rarely known in the real world, simulated data plays a vital role in evaluating the performance of the various causal discovery algorithms proposed in the literature. But recent work highlighted certain artifacts of commonly used data generation techniques for a standard class of structural causal models (SCM) that may be nonphysical, including var- and R2-sortability, where the variables' variance and coefficients of determination (R2) after regressing on all other variables, respectively, increase along the causal order. Some causal methods exploit such artifacts, leading to unrealistic expectations for their performance on real-world data. Some modifications have been proposed to remove these artifacts; notably, the internally-standardized structural causal model (iSCM) avoids varsortability and largely alleviates R2-sortability on sparse causal graphs, but exhibits a reversed R2-sortability pattern for denser graphs not featured in their work. We analyze which sortability patterns we expect to see in real data, and propose a method for drawing coefficients that we argue more effectively samples the space of SCMs. Finally, we propose a novel extension of our SCM generation method to the time series setting.",

We also prove that OW-HNPV is mathematically stable. It behaves in a controlled, predictable way, even when comparing persistence diagrams from networks with different feature types. Applied to Ethereum transaction networks (May 2017-May 2018), OW-HNPV demonstrates superior performance for cryptocurrency anomaly detection, achieving up to 10.4% AUC gain over baseline models for 7-day price movement predictions. Compared with established methods, including Vector of Averaged Bettis (VAB), persistence landscapes, and persistence images, velocity-based summaries excel at medium- to long-range forecasting (4-7 days), with OW-HNPV providing the most consistent and stable performance across prediction horizons.

These complex textual data sets have immense potential to inform future policy and targeted recommendations. However, because SL text data lack dedicated methods and are noisy, heterogeneous, and prone to anomalies, detecting and inferring key patterns is challenging. We introduce LLmFPCA-detect, a flexible framework that pairs LLM-based text embeddings with functional data analysis to detect clusters and infer anomalies in large SL text datasets. First, LLmFPCA-detect embeds each piece of text into an application-specific numeric space using LLM prompts. Sparse multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA) conducted in the numeric space forms the workhorse to recover primary population characteristics, and produces subject-level scores which, together with baseline static covariates, facilitate data segmentation, unsupervised anomaly detection and inference, and enable other downstream tasks. In particular, we leverage LLMs to perform dynamic keyword profiling guided by the data segments and anomalies discovered by LLmFPCA-detect, and we show that cluster-specific functional PC scores from LLmFPCA-detect, used as features in existing pipelines, help boost prediction performance. We support the stability of LLmFPCA-detect with experiments and evaluate it on two different applications using public datasets, Amazon customer-review trajectories, and Wikipedia talk-page comment streams, demonstrating utility across domains and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "summary": "Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) -- the task of converting music audio into note representations -- has seen rapid progress, driven largely by deep learning systems. Due to the limited availability of richly annotated music datasets, much of the progress in AMT has been concentrated on classical piano music, and even a few very specific datasets. Whether these systems can generalize effectively to other musical contexts remains an open question. Complementing recent studies on distribution shifts in sound (e.g., recording conditions), in this work we investigate the musical dimension -- specifically, variations in genre, dynamics, and polyphony levels. To this end, we introduce the MDS corpus, comprising three distinct subsets -- (1) Genre, (2) Random, and (3) MAEtest -- to emulate different axes of distribution shift. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art AMT systems on the MDS corpus using both traditional information-retrieval and musically-informed performance metrics. Our extensive evaluation isolates and exposes varying degrees of performance degradation under specific distribution shifts. In particular, we measure a note-level F1 performance drop of 20 percentage points due to sound, and 14 due to genre. Generally, we find that dynamics estimation proves more vulnerable to musical variation than onset prediction. Musically informed evaluation metrics, particularly those capturing harmonic structure, help identify potential contributing factors. Furthermore, experiments with randomly generated, non-musical sequences reveal clear limitations in system performance under extreme musical distribution shifts. Altogether, these findings offer new evidence of the persistent impact of the Corpus Bias problem in deep AMT systems.",

    "title": "Generalization performance of narrow one-hidden layer networks in the teacher-student setting",
    "summary": "Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of summary statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.",

    "summary": "Despite the necessity for accurate flood prediction, many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations. Although numerous models for daily river discharge prediction exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major challenge. We address this with a novel method, HYdrological Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER). Our approach applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 47 \"uncalibrated\" catchment-based conceptual hydrological models. A reservoir computing (RC) model, a type of machine learning model, is then trained via linear regression to correct BMA output errors, a non-iterative process ensuring computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the required BMA and RC weights by mapping them to catchment attributes from gauged basins, creating a generalizable framework. Evaluated on 87 Japanese basins, in a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE, of 0.59) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (NSE 0.64) but required only 3 % of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (where only ~20 % of basins are gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (NSE 0.51) by leveraging the physical structure of the ensemble. In contrast, the LSTM's performance degraded substantially (NSE -0.61) due to data insufficiency. These results demonstrate that calibrating individual conceptual hydrological models is unnecessary when using a sufficiently large ensemble that is assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge prediction, particularly in ungauged basins. By eliminating basin-specific calibration, HYPER offers a scalable, interpretable framework for accurate hydrological prediction in diverse data-scarce regions.",

Previously, we introduced hybrid solvers by combining the classical solvers with neural operators for a specific geometry 1, but they tend to under-perform in geometries not encountered during training. To address this challenge, we introduce Geo-DeepONet, a geometry-aware deep operator network that incorporates domain information extracted from finite element discretizations. Geo-DeepONet enables accurate operator learning across arbitrary unstructured meshes without requiring retraining. Building on this, we develop a class of geometry-aware hybrid preconditioned iterative solvers by coupling Geo-DeepONet with traditional methods such as relaxation schemes and Krylov subspace algorithms. Through numerical experiments on parametric PDEs posed over diverse unstructured domains, we demonstrate the enhanced robustness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid solvers for multiple real-world applications.",

However, these techniques face scalability challenges for high-dimensional systems, as they rely on state-space discretization which grows exponentially with dimension. Learning-based approaches to dimensionality reduction, utilizing neural networks and autoencoders, have shown great potential to alleviate this problem. However, ensuring the correctness of the resulting verification results remains an open question. In this work, we provide a formal approach to reduce the dimensionality of systems via convex autoencoders and learn the dynamics in the latent space through a kernel-based method. We then construct a finite abstraction from the learned model in the latent space and guarantee that the abstraction contains the true behaviors of the original system. We show that the verification results in the latent space can be mapped back to the original system. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple systems, including a 26D system controlled by a neural network, showing significant scalability improvements without loss of rigor.",

    "summary": "Counterfactual explanations are increasingly proposed as interpretable mechanisms to achieve algorithmic recourse. However, current counterfactual techniques for time series classification are predominantly designed with static data assumptions and focus on generating minimal input perturbations to flip model predictions. This paper argues that such approaches are fundamentally insufficient in clinical recommendation settings, where interventions unfold over time and must be causally plausible and temporally coherent. We advocate for a shift towards counterfactuals that reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics. We identify critical gaps in existing methods that limit their practical applicability, specifically, temporal blind spots and the lack of user-centered considerations in both method design and evaluation metrics. To support our position, we conduct a robustness analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for time series and show that the generated counterfactuals are highly sensitive to stochastic noise. This finding highlights their limited reliability in real-world clinical settings, where minor measurement variations are inevitable. We conclude by calling for methods and evaluation frameworks that go beyond mere prediction changes without considering feasibility or actionability. We emphasize the need for actionable, purpose-driven interventions that are feasible in real-world contexts for the users of such applications.",

Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines.",

By predicting performance early in the communication phase, potentially sluggish transfers can be identified and selectively monitored, optimizing network usage and overall performance. A key bottleneck to improving the predictive power of machine learning (ML) models in this context is the issue of class imbalance. This project focuses on addressing the class imbalance problem to enhance the accuracy of performance predictions. In this study, we analyze and compare various augmentation strategies, including traditional oversampling methods and generative techniques. Additionally, we adjust the class imbalance ratios in training datasets to evaluate their impact on model performance. While augmentation may improve performance, as the imbalance ratio increases, the performance does not significantly improve. We conclude that even the most advanced technique, such as CTGAN, does not significantly improve over simple stratified sampling.",

    "summary": "Surrogate models (including deep neural networks and other machine learning algorithms in supervised learning) are capable of approximating arbitrarily complex, high-dimensional input-output problems in science and engineering, but require a thorough data-agnostic uncertainty quantification analysis before these can be deployed for any safety-critical application. The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the relevance of the uncertainty model's statistical guarantee, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers relevant information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee.",

The framework comprises three complementary models: (i) a standalone Mamba model that predicts the time evolution of thermochemical state variables from given initial conditions; (ii) a constrained Mamba model that enforces mass conservation while learning the state dynamics; and (iii) a regime-informed architecture employing two standalone Mamba models to capture dynamics across temperature-dependent regimes. We additionally develop a latent Kinetic-Mamba variant that evolves dynamics in a reduced latent space and reconstructs the full state on the physical manifold. We evaluate the accuracy and robustness of Kinetic-Mamba using both time-decomposition and recursive-prediction strategies. We further assess the extrapolation capabilities of the model on varied out-of-distribution datasets. Computational experiments on Syngas and GRI-Mech 3.0 reaction mechanisms demonstrate that our framework achieves high fidelity in predicting complex kinetic behavior using only the initial conditions of the state variables.",

Across centers, polysomnography (PSG) recordings are traditionally scored in 30-s epochs for pragmatic, not physiological, reasons and can vary considerably in electrode count, montage, and subject characteristics. These constraints present challenges in conducting harmonized multi-center sleep studies and discovering novel, robust biomarkers on shorter timescales. Here, we present AnySleep, a deep neural network model that uses any electroencephalography (EEG) or electrooculography (EOG) data to score sleep at adjustable temporal resolutions. We trained and validated the model on over 19,000 overnight recordings from 21 datasets collected across multiple clinics, spanning nearly 200,000 hours of EEG and EOG data, to promote robust generalization across sites. The model attains state-of-the-art performance and surpasses or equals established baselines at 30-s epochs. Performance improves as more channels are provided, yet remains strong when EOG is absent or when only EOG or single EEG derivations (frontal, central, or occipital) are available. On sub-30-s timescales, the model captures short wake intrusions consistent with arousals and improves prediction of physiological characteristics (age, sex) and pathophysiological conditions (sleep apnea), relative to standard 30-s scoring. We make the model publicly available to facilitate large-scale studies with heterogeneous electrode setups and to accelerate the discovery of novel biomarkers in sleep.",

First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint.

BATADAL benchmark data is a good source of testing intrusion detection techniques, but it presents several important problems, such as imbalance in the number of classes, multivariate time dependence, and stealthy attacks. We consider a hybrid ensemble learning model that will enhance the detection ability of cyber-attacks in WDS by using the complementary capabilities of machine learning and deep learning models. Three base learners, namely, Random Forest , eXtreme Gradient Boosting , and Long Short-Term Memory network, have been strictly compared and seven ensemble types using simple averaged and stacked learning with a logistic regression meta-learner. Random Forest analysis identified top predictors turned into temporal and statistical features, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to overcome the class imbalance issue. The analyics indicates that the single Long Short-Term Memory network model is of poor performance (F1 = 0.000, AUC = 0.4460), but tree-based models, especially eXtreme Gradient Boosting, perform well (F1 = 0.7470, AUC=0.9684). The hybrid stacked ensemble of Random Forest , eXtreme Gradient Boosting , and Long Short-Term Memory network scored the highest, with the attack class of 0.7205 with an F1-score and a AUC of 0.9826 indicating that the heterogeneous stacking between model precision and generalization can work.

    "summary": "Real-world time series often exhibit strong non-stationarity, complex nonlinear dynamics, and behaviour expressed across multiple temporal scales, from rapid local fluctuations to slow-evolving long-range trends. However, many contemporary architectures impose rigid, fixed-scale structural priors -- such as patch-based tokenization, predefined receptive fields, or frozen backbone encoders -- which can over-regularize temporal dynamics and limit adaptability to abrupt high-magnitude events. To handle this, we introduce the \\emph{Multi-scale Temporal Network} (MSTN), a hybrid neural architecture grounded in an \\emph{Early Temporal Aggregation} principle. MSTN integrates three complementary components: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that captures fine-grained local structure; (ii) a sequence modeling module that learns long-range dependencies through either recurrent or attention-based mechanisms; and (iii) a self-gated fusion stage incorporating squeeze-excitation and multi-head attention to dynamically modulate cross-scale representations. This design enables MSTN to flexibly model temporal patterns spanning milliseconds to extended horizons, while avoiding the computational burden typically associated with long-context models. Across extensive benchmarks covering forecasting, imputation, classification, and cross-dataset generalization, MSTN consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent leading approaches including TIME-LLM, HiMTM, SOFTS, LLM4TS, TimesNet, and PatchTST, and establishing new best results on 24 out of 32 datasets. Despite its strong performance, MSTN remains lightweight and supports fast inference, making it well suited for deployment on edge devices and resource-constrained environments.",

    "summary": "Machine learning is profoundly reshaping molecular and materials modeling; however, given the vast scale of chemical space (10^30-10^60), it remains an open scientific question whether models can achieve convergent learning across this space. We introduce a Dual-Axis Representation-Complete Convergent Learning (RCCL) strategy, enabled by a molecular representation that integrates graph convolutional network (GCN) encoding of local valence environments, grounded in modern valence bond theory, together with no-bridge graph (NBG) encoding of ring/cage topologies, providing a quantitative measure of chemical-space coverage. This framework formalizes representation completeness, establishing a principled basis for constructing datasets that support convergent learning for large models. Guided by this RCCL framework, we develop the FD25 dataset, systematically covering 13,302 local valence units and 165,726 ring/cage topologies, achieving near-complete combinatorial coverage of organic molecules with H/C/N/O/F elements. Graph neural networks trained on FD25 exhibit representation-complete convergent learning and strong out-of-distribution generalization, with an overall prediction error of approximately 1.0 kcal/mol MAE across external benchmarks. Our results establish a quantitative link between molecular representation, structural completeness, and model generalization, providing a foundation for interpretable, transferable, and data-efficient molecular intelligence.",

    "title": "Learnability Window in Gated Recurrent Neural Networks",
    "summary": "We develop a theoretical framework that explains how gating mechanisms determine the learnability window $\\mathcal{H}_N$ of recurrent neural networks, defined as the largest temporal horizon over which gradient information remains statistically recoverable. While classical analyses emphasize numerical stability of Jacobian products, we show that stability alone is insufficient: learnability is governed instead by the \\emph{effective learning rates} $μ_{t,\\ell}$, per-lag and per-neuron quantities obtained from first-order expansions of gate-induced Jacobian products in Backpropagation Through Time. These effective learning rates act as multiplicative filters that control both the magnitude and anisotropy of gradient transport. Under heavy-tailed ($α$-stable) gradient noise, we prove that the minimal sample size required to detect a dependency at lag~$\\ell$ satisfies $N(\\ell)\\propto f(\\ell)^{-α}$, where $f(\\ell)=\\|μ_{t,\\ell}\\|_1$ is the effective learning rate envelope. This leads to an explicit formula for $\\mathcal{H}_N$ and closed-form scaling laws for logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay of $f(\\ell)$. The theory shows that the time-scale spectra induced by the effective learning rates are the dominant determinants of learnability. Broader or more heterogeneous spectra slow the decay of $f(\\ell)$, enlarging the learnability window, while heavy-tailed noise compresses $\\mathcal{H}_N$ by limiting statistical concentration. By integrating gate-induced time-scale geometry with gradient noise and sample complexity, the framework identifies the effective learning rates as the primary objects that determine whether, when, and over what horizons recurrent networks can learn long-range temporal dependencies.",

    "summary": "As the global economy transitions toward decarbonization, the aluminium sector has become a focal point for strategic resource management. While policies such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) aim to reduce emissions, they have inadvertently widened the price arbitrage between primary metal, scrap, and semi-finished goods, creating new incentives for market optimization. This study presents a unified, unsupervised machine learning framework to detect and classify emerging trade anomalies within UN Comtrade data (2020 to 2024). Moving beyond traditional rule-based monitoring, we apply a four-layer analytical pipeline utilizing Forensic Statistics, Isolation Forests, Network Science, and Deep Autoencoders. Contrary to the hypothesis that Sustainability Arbitrage would be the primary driver, empirical results reveal a contradictory and more severe phenomenon of Hardware Masking. Illicit actors exploit bi-directional tariff incentives by misclassifying scrap as high-count heterogeneous goods to justify extreme unit-price outliers of >$160/kg, a 1,900% markup indicative of Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) rather than commercial arbitrage. Topologically, risk is not concentrated in major exporters but in high-centrality Shadow Hubs that function as pivotal nodes for illicit rerouting. These actors execute a strategy of Void-Shoring, systematically suppressing destination data to Unspecified Code to fracture mirror statistics and sever forensic trails. Validated by SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), the results confirm that price deviation is the dominant predictor of anomalies, necessitating a paradigm shift in customs enforcement from physical volume checks to dynamic, algorithmic valuation auditing.",

However, the unsupervised density estimation technique requires tuning a crucial hyperparameter: the kernel bandwidth. The choice of bandwidth is critical as it controls the bias-variance trade-off by over- or under-smoothing the topological features. Topological data analysis provides methods to mathematically quantify topological characteristics, such as connected components, loops, voids et cetera, even in high dimensions where visualization of density estimates is impossible. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach using a topology-based loss function for the automated and unsupervised selection of the optimal bandwidth and benchmark it against classical techniques -- demonstrating its potential across different dimensions.",

    "summary": "In this work, we revisit dictionary-based sparse regression, in particular, Sequential Threshold Least Squares (STLS), and propose a score-guided library selection to provide practical guidance for data-driven modeling, with emphasis on SINDy-type algorithms. STLS is an algorithm to solve the $\\ell_0$ sparse least-squares problem, which relies on splitting to efficiently solve the least-squares portion while handling the sparse term via proximal methods. It produces coefficient vectors whose components depend on both the projected reconstruction errors, here referred to as the scores, and the mutual coherence of dictionary terms. The first contribution of this work is a theoretical analysis of the score and dictionary-selection strategy. This could be understood in both the original and weak SINDy regime. Second, numerical experiments on ordinary and partial differential equations highlight the effectiveness of score-based screening, improving both accuracy and interpretability in dynamical system identification. These results suggest that integrating score-guided methods to refine the dictionary more accurately may help SINDy users in some cases to enhance their robustness for data-driven discovery of governing equations.",

Therefore, this paper proposes GRAFT (GRid-Aware Forecasting with Text), which modifies and improves STanHOP to better support grid-aware forecasting and multi-source textual interventions. Specifically, GRAFT strictly aligns daily-aggregated news, social media, and policy texts with half-hour load, and realizes text-guided fusion to specific time positions via cross-attention during both training and rolling forecasting. In addition, GRAFT provides a plug-and-play external-memory interface to accommodate different information sources in real-world deployment. We construct and release a unified aligned benchmark covering 2019--2021 for five Australian states (half-hour load, daily-aligned weather/calendar variables, and three categories of external texts), and conduct systematic, reproducible evaluations at three scales -- hourly, daily, and monthly -- under a unified protocol for comparison across regions, external sources, and time scales. Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons. Moreover, the model is robust in event-driven scenarios and enables temporal localization and source-level interpretation of text-to-load effects through attention read-out. We release the benchmark, preprocessing scripts, and forecasting results to facilitate standardized empirical evaluation and reproducibility in power grid load forecasting.",

All shapes are simulated under a broad range of Mach numbers and angles of attack covering the typical flight envelope. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we benchmark two state-of-the-art Transformers that accurately predict surface flow and achieve a 2.5 drag-count error on held-out samples. Models pretrained on SuperWing further exhibit strong zero-shot generalization to complex benchmark wings such as DLR-F6 and NASA CRM, underscoring the dataset's diversity and potential for practical usage.",

Our framework establishes a rigorous mathematical connection between canary offset and trace distance bounds, deriving empirical lower bounds on privacy budget consumption that bridge the critical gap between theoretical guarantees and practical privacy verification. Comprehensive evaluations across both simulated and physical quantum hardware demonstrate our framework's effectiveness in measuring actual privacy loss in QML models, enabling robust privacy verification in QML systems.",

    "summary": "Three-dimensional ultrasound enables real-time volumetric visualization of anatomical structures. Unlike traditional 2D ultrasound, 3D imaging reduces reliance on precise probe orientation, potentially making ultrasound more accessible to clinicians with varying levels of experience and improving automated measurements and post-exam analysis. However, achieving both high volume rates and high image quality remains a significant challenge. While 3D diverging waves can provide high volume rates, they suffer from limited tissue harmonic generation and increased multipath effects, which degrade image quality. One compromise is to retain focus in elevation while leveraging unfocused diverging waves in the lateral direction to reduce the number of transmissions per elevation plane. Reaching the volume rates achieved by full 3D diverging waves, however, requires dramatically undersampling the number of elevation planes. Subsequently, to render the full volume, simple interpolation techniques are applied. This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D ultrasound reconstruction from a reduced set of elevation planes by employing diffusion models (DMs) to achieve increased spatial and temporal resolution. We compare both traditional and supervised deep learning-based interpolation methods on a 3D cardiac ultrasound dataset. Our results show that DM-based reconstruction consistently outperforms the baselines in image quality and downstream task performance. Additionally, we accelerate inference by leveraging the temporal consistency inherent to ultrasound sequences. Finally, we explore the robustness of the proposed method by exploiting the probabilistic nature of diffusion posterior sampling to quantify reconstruction uncertainty and demonstrate improved recall on out-of-distribution data with synthetic anomalies under strong subsampling.",

    "summary": "Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition, these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems, additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e., detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1 with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better accuracy.",

This setting directly leads to the use of unbalanced Kantorovich-Rubinstein norms defined by duality with Lipschitz functions, and of spaces of measures dual to those of continuous functions with controlled growth. These allow to make transparent the need for total variation and moment bounds or penalization to obtain existence of minimizers of variational formulations, under which we prove a compactness result in strong Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, and in the absence of which we show several examples demonstrating undesirable behavior. Further, the Kantorovich-Rubinstein setting enables us to combine the advantages of a completely linear parametrization and ensuing reproducing kernel Banach space framework with optimal transport insights. We showcase this synergy with representer theorems and uniform large data limits for empirical risk minimization, and in proposed formulations for distillation and fusion applications.",

However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.",

Across the considered benchmarks, the student model achieves inference speedups ranging from x4.8 (Navier-Stokes) to x6.9 (Burgers), while preserving accuracy. Accuracy is improved by on the order of 1% when the model is properly tuned. The distillation process also revealed a regularizing effect. With an average inference latency of 5.3 ms on CPU, the distilled models enter the ultra-low-latency real-time regime defined by sub-10 ms performance.

We study this phenomenon in classical Hopfield networks and show they can infer the full isomorphism class of a graph from a small random sample. Our results reveal that: (i) graph isomorphism classes can be represented within a three-dimensional invariant subspace, (ii) using gradient descent to minimize energy flow (MEF) has an implicit bias toward norm-efficient solutions, which underpins a polynomial sample complexity bound for learning isomorphism classes, and (iii) across multiple learning rules, parameters converge toward the invariant subspace as sample sizes grow. Together, these findings highlight a unifying mechanism for generalization in Hopfield networks: a bias toward norm efficiency in learning drives the emergence of approximate invariance under group-structured data.",

But evaluating the reliability and efficacy of a proposed deception detector requires examples that we can confidently label as either deceptive or honest. We argue that we currently lack the necessary examples and further identify several concrete obstacles in collecting them. We provide evidence from conceptual arguments, analysis of existing empirical works, and analysis of novel illustrative case studies. We also discuss the potential of several proposed empirical workarounds to these problems and argue that while they seem valuable, they also seem insufficient alone.

    "title": "Improving the Accuracy of Amortized Model Comparison with Self-Consistency",
    "summary": "Amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) offers fast, scalable approximations to posterior densities by training neural surrogates on data simulated from the statistical model. However, ABI methods are highly sensitive to model misspecification: when observed data fall outside the training distribution (generative scope of the statistical models), neural surrogates can behave unpredictably. This makes it a challenge in a model comparison setting, where multiple statistical models are considered, of which at least some are misspecified. Recent work on self-consistency (SC) provides a promising remedy to this issue, accessible even for empirical data (without ground-truth labels). In this work, we investigate how SC can improve amortized model comparison conceptualized in four different ways. Across two synthetic and two real-world case studies, we find that approaches for model comparison that estimate marginal likelihoods through approximate parameter posteriors consistently outperform methods that directly approximate model evidence or posterior model probabilities. SC training improves robustness when the likelihood is available, even under severe model misspecification. The benefits of SC for methods without access of analytic likelihoods are more limited and inconsistent. Our results suggest practical guidance for reliable amortized Bayesian model comparison: prefer parameter posterior-based methods and augment them with SC training on empirical datasets to mitigate extrapolation bias under model misspecification.",

    "summary": "Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are vital for monitoring cardiac health, enabling the assessment of heart rate variability (HRV), detection of arrhythmias, and diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions. However, ECG signals recorded from wearable devices are frequently corrupted by noise artifacts, particularly those arising from motion and large muscle activity, which distort R-peaks and the QRS complex. These distortions hinder reliable HRV analysis and increase the risk of clinical misinterpretation.\n  Existing studies on ECG noise detection typically evaluate performance on a single dataset, limiting insight into the generalizability of such methods across diverse sensors and recording conditions. In this work, we propose an HRV-based machine learning approach to detect noisy ECG segments and evaluate its generalizability using cross-dataset experiments on four datasets collected in both controlled and uncontrolled settings. Our method achieves over 90% average accuracy and an AUPRC exceeding 90%, even on previously unseen datasets-demonstrating robust performance across heterogeneous data sources. To support reproducibility and further research, we also release a curated and labeled ECG dataset annotated for noise artifacts.",

We apply the achievable region method with partial conservation law (PCL) to the infinite-state problem and analyze its indexability and priority index (Whittle index).

    "summary": "The demand of finite raw materials will keep increasing as they fuel modern society. Simultaneously, solutions for stopping carbon emissions in the short term are not available, thus making the net zero target extremely challenging to achieve at scale. The circular economy (CE) paradigm is gaining attention as a solution to address climate change and the uncertainties of supplies of critical materials. Hence, in this paper, we introduce CiRL, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) library of environments focused on the circularity control of both solid and fluid materials. The integration of DRL into the design of material circularity is possible thanks to the formalism of thermodynamical material networks, which is underpinned by compartmental dynamical thermodynamics. Along with the focus on circularity, this library has three more features: the new CE-oriented environments are in the state-space form, which is typically used in dynamical systems analysis and control design; it is based on a state-of-the-art Python library of DRL algorithms, namely, Stable-Baselines3; and it is developed in Google Colaboratory to be accessible to researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds as is often the case for circular economy researchers and engineers. CiRL is intended to be a tool to generate AI-driven actions for optimizing the circularity of supply-recovery chains and to be combined with human-driven decisions derived from material flow analysis (MFA) studies. CiRL is publicly available.",

Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws.",

Contrary to most existing approaches, it considers a framework of structured model learning, where existing, approximately correct physical models are augmented with components that are learned from data. The main result of the paper is a uniqueness result that covers a large class of PDEs and a suitable class of neural networks used for approximating the unknown model components. The uniqueness result shows that, in the idealized setting of full, noiseless measurements, a unique identification of the unknown model components is possible as regularization-minimizing solution of the PDE system. Furthermore, the paper provides a convergence result showing that model components learned on the basis of incomplete, noisy measurements approximate the regularization-minimizing solution of the PDE system in the limit. These results are possible under specific properties of the approximating neural networks and due to a dedicated choice of regularization. With this, a practical contribution of this analytic paper is to provide a class of model learning frameworks different to standard settings where uniqueness can be expected in the limit of full measurements.",

Due to the low quality of a large fraction of raw web data, data curation has become a critical step in the training pipeline. Filtering using a trained model (i.e., teacher-based filtering) has emerged as a successful solution, leveraging a pre-trained model to compute quality scores. To explain the empirical success of teacher-based filtering, we characterize the performance of filtered contrastive learning under the standard bimodal data generation model. Denoting $η\\in(0,1]$ as the fraction of data with correctly matched modalities among $n$ paired samples, we utilize a linear contrastive learning setup to show a provable benefit of data filtering: $(i)$ the error without filtering is upper and lower bounded by $\\frac{1}{η\\sqrt{n}}$, and $(ii)$ the error with teacher-based filtering is upper bounded by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ηn}}$ in the large $η$ regime, and by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ in the small $η$ regime.",

Together, the modules enable Pace to predict battery health accurately and efficiently in various battery usage conditions. In a large public dataset, Pace performs much better than existing models, achieving an average performance improvement of 6.5 and 2.0x compared to two best-performing baseline models. We further demonstrate its practical viability with a real-time edge deployment on a Raspberry Pi. These results establish Pace as a practical and high-performance solution for battery health analytics.",

In this work, we adapt split CP to handle missing values by proposing a preimpute-mask-then-correct framework that can offer valid coverage. We show that our method provides guaranteed Marginal Coverage and Mask-Conditional Validity for general missing data mechanisms. A key component of our approach is a reweighted conformal prediction procedure that corrects the prediction sets after distributional imputation (multiple imputation) of the calibration dataset, making our method compatible with standard imputation pipelines. We derive two algorithms, and we show that they are approximately marginally valid and MCV. We evaluate them on synthetic and real-world datasets. It reduces significantly the width of prediction intervals w.r.t standard MCV methods, while maintaining the target guarantees.",

Deep learning enables high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts that can surpass traditional numerical models, while FL allows institutions in different locations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, addressing efficiency and security concerns. While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K. Finally, we assess trimmed mean aggregation as a defense mechanism, showing that it successfully defends against global bias attacks (2-13% degradation) but fails against patch attacks (281-603% amplification), exposing limitations of outlier-based defenses for spatially correlated data.",

To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines.

Among various optimization-based attacks, the gradient-based PGD and the momentum-based MI-FGSM have garnered considerable interest. However, all these attacks use the sign function to scale their perturbations, which raises several theoretical concerns from the point of view of optimization. In this paper, we first reveal that PGD is actually a specific reformulation of the projected gradient method using only the current gradient to determine its step-size. Further, we show that when we utilize a conventional adaptive matrix with the accumulated gradients to scale the perturbation, PGD becomes AdaGrad. Motivated by this analysis, we present a novel momentum-based attack AdaMI, in which the perturbation is optimized with an interesting momentum-based adaptive matrix. AdaMI is proved to attain optimal convergence for convex problems, indicating that it addresses the non-convergence issue of MI-FGSM, thereby ensuring stability of the optimization process. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed momentum-based adaptive matrix can serve as a general and effective technique to boost adversarial transferability over the state-of-the-art methods across different networks while maintaining better stability and imperceptibility.",

However, enhancing fidelity without compromising semantic content remains a key challenge in the field. Recent diffusion research in multiple disciplines has introduced objectives and architectural refinements that tighten the match between generated and real data distributions, yielding higher fidelity than earlier generative frameworks. Multi-stage architectures, physics-guided modeling, semantic conditioning, and rarity-aware generation are some of the explored works to achieve this task. However, the integration of structural information of the data distribution into DDPM has largely been unexplored. The conventional DDPM framework relies solely on the $L^2$ norm between the additive and predicted noise to generate new data distributions. We introduce I-Diff, an improved version of DDPM that incorporates a carefully designed regularizer, effectively enabling the model to encode structural information, thereby preserving the inherent fidelity of the data distribution. The proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments on DDPM, Improved DDPM and Latent Diffusion Model across multiple datasets. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in fidelity (Density and Precision increase 10% and 37% in CIFAR-100 dataset respectively) across other tested datasets. These results highlight the effectiveness of our method in enhancing the fidelity of the generated data.

    "title": "Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective",
    "summary": "Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. Furthermore, as a novel plug-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/SRSNet.",

    "summary": "Acoustic Word Embeddings (AWEs) improve the efficiency of speech retrieval tasks such as Spoken Term Detection (STD) and Keyword Spotting (KWS). However, existing approaches suffer from limitations, including unimodal supervision, disjoint optimization of audio-audio and audio-text alignment, and the need for task-specific models. To address these shortcomings, we propose a joint multimodal contrastive learning framework that unifies both acoustic and cross-modal supervision in a shared embedding space. Our approach simultaneously optimizes: (i) audio-text contrastive learning, inspired by the CLAP loss, to align audio and text representations and (ii) audio-audio contrastive learning, via Deep Word Discrimination (DWD) loss, to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separation. The proposed method outperforms existing AWE baselines on word discrimination task while flexibly supporting both STD and KWS. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach of its kind.",

What underlies efficient development in humans? We investigated this problem through experiments wherein robotic agents learn to perform actions associated with imperative sentences (e.g., push red cube) via curiosity-driven self-exploration. Our approach integrates active inference with reinforcement learning, enabling intrinsically motivated developmental learning. The simulations reveal key findings corresponding to observations in developmental psychology. i) Generalization improves drastically as the scale of compositional elements increases. ii) Curiosity improves learning through self-exploration. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions precedes compositional generalization. iv) Simpler actions develop before complex actions depending on them. v) Exception-handling induces U-shaped developmental performance, a pattern like representational redescription in child language learning. These results suggest that curiosity-driven active inference accounts for how intrinsically motivated sensorimotor-linguistic learning supports scalable compositional generalization and exception handling in humans and artificial agents.",

    "summary": "Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for enforcing safety in optimization-based controllers, and their integration with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has enabled the specification-driven synthesis of complex robotic behaviors. However, existing CBF-STL approaches typically rely on fixed hyperparameters and myopic, per-time step optimization, which can lead to overly conservative behavior, infeasibility near tight input limits, and difficulty satisfying long-horizon STL tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a feasibility-aware learning framework that embeds trainable, time-varying High Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) into a differentiable Quadratic Program (dQP). Our approach provides a systematic procedure for constructing time-varying HOCBF constraints for a broad fragment of STL and introduces a unified robustness measure that jointly captures STL satisfaction, QP feasibility, and control-bound compliance. Three neural networks-InitNet, RefNet, and an extended BarrierNet-collaborate to generate reference inputs and adapt constraint-related hyperparameters automatically over time and across initial conditions, reducing conservativeness while maximizing robustness. The resulting controller achieves STL satisfaction with strictly feasible dQPs and requires no manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains high STL robustness under tight input bounds and significantly outperforms fixed-parameter and non-adaptive baselines in complex environments.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. However, the quality and stability of the trained reward model largely determine the final alignment performance. Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors.\n  In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling. Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences. Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework. S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness. Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training.

    "summary": "Creating realistic 3D animation remains a time-consuming and expertise-dependent process, requiring manual rigging, keyframing, and fine-tuning of complex motions. Meanwhile, video diffusion models have recently demonstrated remarkable motion imagination in 2D, generating dynamic and visually coherent motion from text or image prompts. However, their results lack explicit 3D structure and cannot be directly used for animation or simulation. We present AnimaMimic, a framework that animates static 3D meshes using motion priors learned from video diffusion models. Starting from an input mesh, AnimaMimic synthesizes a monocular animation video, automatically constructs a skeleton with skinning weights, and refines joint parameters through differentiable rendering and video-based supervision. To further enhance realism, we integrate a differentiable simulation module that refines mesh deformation through physically grounded soft-tissue dynamics. Our method bridges the creativity of video diffusion and the structural control of 3D rigged animation, producing physically plausible, temporally coherent, and artist-editable motion sequences that integrate seamlessly into standard animation pipelines.

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is often used as a foundation for this, but its signals can be unreliable in obstructed environments due to multi-path effects or loss-of-signal. While existing datasets compensate for the sporadic loss of GNSS signals by incorporating Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements, the commonly used Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG)-based systems do not permit the prolonged study of GNSS-denied environments. To close this gap, we present Odyssey, a LIO dataset with a focus on GNSS-denied environments such as tunnels and parking garages as well as other underrepresented, yet ubiquitous situations such as stop-and-go-traffic, bumpy roads and wide open fields. Our ground truth is derived from a navigation-grade Inertial Navigation System (INS) equipped with a Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG), offering exceptional bias stability characteristics compared to IMUs used in existing datasets and enabling the prolonged and accurate study of GNSS-denied environments. This makes Odyssey the first publicly available dataset featuring a RLG-based INS. Besides providing data for LIO, we also support other tasks, such as place recognition, through the threefold repetition of all trajectories as well as the integration of external mapping data by providing precise geodetic coordinates.

The resulting algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, reaching the accuracy of sampling-based procedures. Additionally, a batch-based variant is introduced, yielding highly efficient computation while outperforming all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms.

It is crucial to detect both dynamic road users and static objects like traffic signs or lanes as these are required for safe motion planning. However, in many circumstances a complete perception of other objects or lanes is not achievable due to limited sensor ranges, occlusions, and curves. In scenarios where an accurate localization is not possible or for roads where no HD maps are available, an autonomous vehicle must rely solely on its perceived road information. Thus, extending local sensing capabilities through collective perception using vehicle-to-vehicle communication is a promising strategy that has not yet been explored for lane detection. Therefore, we propose a real-time capable approach for collective perception of lanes using a spline-based estimation of undetected road sections. We evaluate our proposed fusion algorithm in various situations and road types. We were able to achieve real-time capability and extend the perception range by up to 200%.",

    "summary": "Approximate model-predictive control (AMPC) aims to imitate an MPC's behavior with a neural network, removing the need to solve an expensive optimization problem at runtime. However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.",

    "title": "A Geometric Task-Space Port-Hamiltonian Formulation for Redundant Manipulators",
    "summary": "We present a novel geometric port-Hamiltonian formulation of redundant manipulators performing a differential kinematic task $η=J(q)\\dot{q}$, where $q$ is a point on the configuration manifold, $η$ is a velocity-like task space variable, and $J(q)$ is a linear map representing the task, for example the classical analytic or geometric manipulator Jacobian matrix. The proposed model emerges from a change of coordinates from canonical Hamiltonian dynamics, and splits the standard Hamiltonian momentum variable into a task-space momentum variable and a null-space momentum variable. Properties of this model and relation to Lagrangian formulations present in the literature are highlighted. Finally, we apply the proposed model in an \\textit{Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control} (IDA-PBC) design to stabilize and shape the impedance of a 7-DOF Emika Panda robot in simulation.",

    "title": "Field evaluation and optimization of a lightweight lidar-based UAV navigation system for dense boreal forest environments",
    "summary": "The interest in the usage of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) for forest applications has increased in recent years. While above-canopy flight has reached a high level of autonomy, navigating under-canopy remains a significant challenge. The use of autonomous UAVs could reduce the burden of data collection, which has motivated the development of numerous solutions for under-canopy autonomous flight. However, the experiments conducted in the literature and their reporting lack rigor. Very rarely, the density and the difficulty of the test forests are reported, or multiple flights are flown, and the success rate of those flights is reported. The aim of this study was to implement an autonomously flying quadrotor based on a lightweight lidar using openly available algorithms and test its behavior in real forest environments. A set of rigorous experiments was conducted with a quadrotor prototype utilizing the IPC path planner and LTA-OM SLAM algorithm. Based on the results of the first 33 flights, the original system was further enhanced. With the optimized system, 60 flights were performed, resulting in a total of 93 test flights. The optimized system performed significantly better in terms of reliability and flight mission completion times, achieving success rates of 12/15 in a medium-density forest and 15/15 in a dense forest, at a target flight velocity of 1 m/s. At a target flight velocity of 2 m/s, it had a success rate of 12/15 and 5/15, respectively. Furthermore, a standardized testing setup and evaluation criteria were proposed, enabling consistent performance comparisons of autonomous under-canopy UAV systems, enhancing reproducibility, guiding system improvements, and accelerating progress in forest robotics.",

    "title": "ARCADE: Adaptive Robot Control with Online Changepoint-Aware Bayesian Dynamics Learning",
    "summary": "Real-world robots must operate under evolving dynamics caused by changing operating conditions, external disturbances, and unmodeled effects. These may appear as gradual drifts, transient fluctuations, or abrupt shifts, demanding real-time adaptation that is robust to short-term variation yet responsive to lasting change. We propose a framework for modeling the nonlinear dynamics of robotic systems that can be updated in real time from streaming data. The method decouples representation learning from online adaptation, using latent representations learned offline to support online closed-form Bayesian updates. To handle evolving conditions, we introduce a changepoint-aware mechanism with a latent variable inferred from data likelihoods that indicates continuity or shift. When continuity is likely, evidence accumulates to refine predictions; when a shift is detected, past information is tempered to enable rapid re-learning. This maintains calibrated uncertainty and supports probabilistic reasoning about transient, gradual, or structural change. We prove that the adaptive regret of the framework grows only logarithmically in time and linearly with the number of shifts, competitive with an oracle that knows timings of shift. We validate on cartpole simulations and real quadrotor flights with swinging payloads and mid-flight drops, showing improved predictive accuracy, faster recovery, and more accurate closed-loop tracking than relevant baselines.",

    "summary": "Teleoperation presents a promising paradigm for remote control and robot proprioceptive data collection. Despite recent progress, current teleoperation systems still suffer from limitations in efficiency and ergonomics, particularly in challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose CaFe-TeleVision, a coarse-to-fine teleoperation system with immersive situated visualization for enhanced ergonomics. At its core, a coarse-to-fine control mechanism is proposed in the retargeting module to bridge workspace disparities, jointly optimizing efficiency and physical ergonomics. To stream immersive feedback with adequate visual cues for human vision systems, an on-demand situated visualization technique is integrated in the perception module, which reduces the cognitive load for multi-view processing. The system is built on a humanoid collaborative robot and validated with six challenging bimanual manipulation tasks. User study among 24 participants confirms that CaFe-TeleVision enhances ergonomics with statistical significance, indicating a lower task load and a higher user acceptance during teleoperation. Quantitative results also validate the superior performance of our system across six tasks, surpassing comparative methods by up to 28.89% in success rate and accelerating by 26.81% in completion time.

    "summary": "This article presents MAPS$^2$ : a distributed algorithm that allows multi-robot systems to deliver coupled tasks expressed as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) constraints. Classical control theoretical tools addressing STL constraints either adopt a limited fragment of the STL formula or require approximations of min/max operators, whereas works maximising robustness through optimisation-based methods often suffer from local minima, relaxing any completeness arguments due to the NP-hard nature of the problem. Endowed with probabilistic guarantees, MAPS$^2$ provides an anytime algorithm that iteratively improves the robots' trajectories. The algorithm selectively imposes spatial constraints by taking advantage of the temporal properties of the STL. The algorithm is distributed, in the sense that each robot calculates its trajectory by communicating only with its immediate neighbours as defined via a communication graph. We illustrate the efficiency of MAPS$^2$ by conducting extensive simulation and experimental studies, verifying the generation of STL satisfying trajectories.",

    "summary": "We consider the problem of cooperative manipulation by a mobile multi-manipulator system operating in obstacle-cluttered and highly constrained environments under spatio-temporal task specifications. The task requires transporting a grasped object while respecting both continuous robot dynamics and discrete geometric constraints arising from obstacles and narrow passages. To address this hybrid structure, we propose a multi-rate planning and control framework that combines offline generation of an STL-satisfying object trajectory and collision-free base footprints with online constrained inverse kinematics and continuous-time feedback control. The resulting closed-loop system enables coordinated reconfiguration of multiple manipulators while tracking the desired object motion. The approach is evaluated in high-fidelity physics simulations using three Franka Emika Panda mobile manipulators rigidly grasping an object.",

    "summary": "While many visual odometry (VO), visual-inertial odometry (VIO), and SLAM systems achieve high accuracy, the majority of existing methods miss to assess risks at runtime. This paper presents SUPER (Sensitivity-based Uncertainty-aware PErformance and Risk assessment) that is a generic and explainable framework that propagates uncertainties via sensitivities for real-time risk assessment in VIO. The scientific novelty lies in the derivation of a real-time risk indicator that is backend-agnostic and exploits the Schur complement blocks of the Gauss-Newton normal matrix to propagate uncertainties. Practically, the Schur complement captures the sensitivity that reflects the influence of the uncertainty on the risk occurrence. Our framework estimates risks on the basis of the residual magnitudes, geometric conditioning, and short horizon temporal trends without requiring ground truth knowledge. Our framework enables to reliably predict trajectory degradation 50 frames ahead with an improvement of 20% to the baseline. In addition, SUPER initiates a stop or relocalization policy with 89.1% recall. The framework is backend agnostic and operates in real time with less than 0.2% additional CPU cost. Experiments show that SUPER provides consistent uncertainty estimates. A SLAM evaluation highlights the applicability to long horizon mapping.",

    "summary": "Industrial human-robot collaboration requires motion planning that is collision-free, responsive, and ergonomically safe to reduce fatigue and musculoskeletal risk. We propose the Configuration Space Ergonomic Field (CSEF), a continuous and differentiable field over the human joint space that quantifies ergonomic quality and provides gradients for real-time ergonomics-aware planning. An efficient algorithm constructs CSEF from established metrics with joint-wise weighting and task conditioning, and we integrate it into a gradient-based planner compatible with impedance-controlled robots. In a 2-DoF benchmark, CSEF-based planning achieves higher success rates, lower ergonomic cost, and faster computation than a task-space ergonomic planner. Hardware experiments with a dual-arm robot in unimanual guidance, collaborative drilling, and bimanual cocarrying show faster ergonomic cost reduction, closer tracking to optimized joint targets, and lower muscle activation than a point-to-point baseline. CSEF-based planning method reduces average ergonomic scores by up to 10.31% for collaborative drilling tasks and 5.60% for bimanual co-carrying tasks while decreasing activation in key muscle groups, indicating practical benefits for real-world deployment.",
