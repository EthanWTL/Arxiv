    "summary": "Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are\ninherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits\nthroughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models\n(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language\ngeneration, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to\nthousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for\niterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A\ndiscrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.\nThe core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit\nparameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big\nmove lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update\nrule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and\nwith strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,\nthese choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On\nlanguage modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity\nparity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens\nusing a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and\ncorresponding latency/throughput gains.",

    "summary": "Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure\nrelationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for\ncomplex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a\nnew bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these\nmethods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently\nintroduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we\nshow the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.\nIn particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square\nError (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over\nall Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only\npasses self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based\ndiffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance\nsampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong\nperformance even when the MI is high.",

Simple\nfactual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex\nlogical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To\novercome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through\nDepth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends\nthe Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised\ncomputation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning\ndepths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical\ninference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned\nrouting network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only\nthe necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we\ntrained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse\ndomains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web\ncontent, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational\nsavings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth\ntransformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex\nmulti-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield\ninterpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability.

We\npropose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse\nreward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated\nas a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a\nreward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion\nposterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce\nnon-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference\ninefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward\nFine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing\ntrajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,\na naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data\nfidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a\nlayer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally\nlocalized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based\nregularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional\ndistillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently\nachieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,\nhighlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific\ngenerative modeling.",

This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,\ncross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that\noperates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring\nlanguage-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the\nmultilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention\nmechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract\nmedically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align\nsemantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning\nmodule is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different\nlanguages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module\nand a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation\nlearning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly\noptimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive\nlearning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning\n(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen\nlanguages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes\nrobust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning.

Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first\nrobust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the\nrecognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for\ninference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules.

    "summary": "Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by\nelectromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.\nUnfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of\nobjects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it\ndifficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors\nis the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can\nconsiderably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.\n  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG\nbased control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals\nin order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists\nof two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree\nof contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest\nneighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all\nrecognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which\nallows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the\nrecognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real\nbiosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental\ncomparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method\non which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy\nrecognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the\nliterature.",

    "title": "Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms\n  During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications",
    "summary": "Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting\nto dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and\nefficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant\nchallenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences\noffline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a\ncomprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible\nscenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The\nprimary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of\noffline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete\nspace, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the\nonline mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously\nexploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and\nenhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the\nsystem to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more\neffectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning\nunit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models\nnot only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing\nschedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria\nare introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time\ntraining, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,\nthus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical\nenvironments.",

    "summary": "Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of\ntime-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling\nframeworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked\nloops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or\ninvalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To\naddress these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework\ndesigned to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed\nreconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or\nheuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,\nensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and\ncollision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient\nallocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context\nevents, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive\nexperiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including\nmakespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate\nthe operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate\nthat the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,\noperational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational\nefficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to\nthe problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling\nreliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and\nuncertain operational conditions.",

    "summary": "Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via\nentropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a\nuniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes\ninefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the\nentropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a\nmeasure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and\ndisequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform\ndistribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity\n(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward\nregimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise\nbecause the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and\ncomplete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet\nadaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we\nintroduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning\nalgorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a\nrange of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of\nthe complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially\nin environments requiring greater exploration.",

In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent\nReview System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review\nprocess.

However, extracting\nmeaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel\nvariability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end\ndeep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key\ninnovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing\nmulti-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for\ndifferent EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle\nthe high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder\nthat simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within\nlocalized {\\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated\ngating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy\nand non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire\nencoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised\nand contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We\nvalidated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the\nclassification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)\ndisorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract\nbiologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,\nautonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization\nthrough innovative architectural and loss design.",

    "summary": "Conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods rely on\ntime-triggered execution, where agents sample and communicate actions at fixed\nintervals. This approach is often computationally expensive and\ncommunication-intensive. To address this limitation, we propose ET-MAPG\n(Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient reinforcement learning), a\nframework that jointly learns an agent's control policy and its\nevent-triggering policy. Unlike prior work that decouples these mechanisms,\nET-MAPG integrates them into a unified learning process, enabling agents to\nlearn not only what action to take but also when to execute it. For scenarios\nwith inter-agent communication, we introduce AET-MAPG, an attention-based\nvariant that leverages a self-attention mechanism to learn selective\ncommunication patterns. AET-MAPG empowers agents to determine not only when to\ntrigger an action but also with whom to communicate and what information to\nexchange, thereby optimizing coordination. Both methods can be integrated with\nany policy gradient MARL algorithm. Extensive experiments across diverse MARL\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approaches achieve performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art, time-triggered baselines while significantly reducing both\ncomputational load and communication overhead.",

While RAG\nhas shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual\nconsistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ\nfrom those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that\nLLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or\nadversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities.

Despite these risks, there is currently no formal\nframework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems.

We identify a core latent\ninstability issue when scaling the computational budget of implicit CoT: as the\nnumber of reasoning tokens increases, training often becomes unstable and\ncollapses. Our analysis shows that this instability arises from latent\nrepresentations becoming homogeneous and losing semantic diversity, caused by\ninsufficient step-level supervision in current implicit CoT methods. To address\nthis, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training module that introduces\nstep-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the latent reasoning space.\nSIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder during training to align each implicit\ntoken with its corresponding explicit reasoning step, ensuring latent states\ncapture distinct and meaningful information. The auxiliary decoder is removed\nat inference, preserving the efficiency of implicit CoT with no added overhead.\nIt also provides interpretability by projecting each latent token onto an\nexplicit reasoning vocabulary, enabling per-step visualization and diagnosis.\nSIM-CoT significantly improves both in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain\nstability of implicit CoT methods, boosting Coconut by +8.2\\% on GPT-2 and CODI\nby +3.0\\% on LLaMA-3.1 8B.

Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates\nin antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high\nbioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,\ncomputational models specifically designed to predict associations between\noligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a\nprompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover\npotential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,\nmicrobes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic\ninformation. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a\nprompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful\npaired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global\nfeatures. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a\nbenchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and\nhyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module.

To understand these security impacts and\nseverity, we design a tool, SSCGuard, to generate 439,138 prompts based on\nSSC-related questions collected online, and analyze the responses of four\npopular LLMs from GPT and Llama.

By evaluating humans and neural networks\nunder controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently\ntexture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features.

We further extend the analysis across\ncomputer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance\npatterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,\nmedical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a\nstronger reliance towards texture.

    "summary": "Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that\nundermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove\nsensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten\" information remains\nprecariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root\ncause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual\ndata points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss\nlandscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can\ndrastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks\nexploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate\nthe steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly\nrecovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical\nrobustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To\naddress this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided\noptimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via\nneighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses\nadversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering\nfeedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through\ngradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that\nour method is significantly more robust against both relearning and\njailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.",

However, these systems often struggle with redundant and\nirrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods\neither fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural\nseparation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model\nthe complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled\nInformation Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal\nInformation Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively\nfiltering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information.\nThen, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the\nrecommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We\nachieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information\nlearning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information\nlearning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning\nobjective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives,\nMRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations.\nExtensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in\nenhancing multimodal recommendation.",

Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint\nand latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference\nscenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its\nimportance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs\ncomplicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that\ntransform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with\nfewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first\nderive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized\nweights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit\nquantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to\nachieve near-optimal quantization performance.

StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape\nin the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent\nstructural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time\nseries.

    "summary": "Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography\n(CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and\ndiagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is\nexceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated\nalgorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we\npropose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on\nthe U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework\nfirst pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive\nautoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency\nregularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure\nstable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a\nreduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL\nachieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation\ndataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach.

    "summary": "This paper examines the integration of emotional intelligence into artificial\nintelligence systems, with a focus on affective computing and the growing\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, to\nrecognize and respond to human emotions. Drawing on interdisciplinary research\nthat combines computer science, psychology, and neuroscience, the study\nanalyzes foundational neural architectures - CNNs for processing facial\nexpressions and RNNs for sequential data, such as speech and text - that enable\nemotion recognition. It examines the transformation of human emotional\nexperiences into structured emotional data, addressing the distinction between\nexplicit emotional data collected with informed consent in research settings\nand implicit data gathered passively through everyday digital interactions.\nThat raises critical concerns about lawful processing, AI transparency, and\nindividual autonomy over emotional expressions in digital environments. The\npaper explores implications across various domains, including healthcare,\neducation, and customer service, while addressing challenges of cultural\nvariations in emotional expression and potential biases in emotion recognition\nsystems across different demographic groups. From a regulatory perspective, the\npaper examines emotional data in the context of the GDPR and the EU AI Act\nframeworks, highlighting how emotional data may be considered sensitive\npersonal data that requires robust safeguards, including purpose limitation,\ndata minimization, and meaningful consent mechanisms.",

We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to\nsystematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images\nacross 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased\ninputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate\nmedical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial\nsycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98%\nsycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95%\nsycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type,\ndepartment, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase\nsusceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger\ndomain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench\nalso serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions\n(negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and\nmotivate training- and decoding-time strategies.

However, most existing works treat speech features as a monolithic\nrepresentation and fail to capture their fine-grained roles in driving\ndifferent facial motions, while also overlooking the importance of modeling\nkeyframes with intense dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose\nKSDiff, a Keyframe-Augmented Speech-Aware Dual-Path Diffusion framework.\nSpecifically, the raw audio and transcript are processed by a Dual-Path Speech\nEncoder (DPSE) to disentangle expression-related and head-pose-related\nfeatures, while an autoregressive Keyframe Establishment Learning (KEL) module\npredicts the most salient motion frames. These components are integrated into a\nDual-path Motion generator to synthesize coherent and realistic facial motions.\nExtensive experiments on HDTF and VoxCeleb demonstrate that KSDiff achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with improvements in both lip synchronization\naccuracy and head-pose naturalness.

However, these methods remain constrained by the\nlimitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode\nphysical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex\nrule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely\nlimited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires\ncomputationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a\nreflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We\nfirst discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action\ncodebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for\nplanning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware\nreflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient\ncomputation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to\nmodel multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search\nmethods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then\nserve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the\nNAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in\nsafety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable\nsolution for autonomous driving systems.",

    "summary": "Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety\nassessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often\nconstrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as\nadversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be\nsteered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate\ntailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of\nthis, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a\nmulti-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework\nnamed \\textbf{S}teerable \\textbf{A}dversarial scenario \\textbf{GE}nerator\n(SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between\nadversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose\nhierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline\nalignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard\nfeasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed\nmodel, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a\ncontinuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating\ntheir weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through\nthe lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and\nrealism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving\npolicies.

Current\nprompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated\ninferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To\naddress this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD)\nframework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent\npipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors\nhow physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and\naccurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a\nMACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician\nagents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and\nhuman oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390\nreal-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs\n(Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves\nprimary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with\ngains up to 22.3% (MACD).

Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it\nachieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover,\nself-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability,\nand model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable\nrationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a\nscalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap\nbetween the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.",

    "summary": "Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems, also known as optimal\nfiltering, is a long-standing problem in various fields of science and\nengineering. In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework,\n\\textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state\nestimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various\nexperiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state\nestimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in\npre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM,\nLLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second,\nwe carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating\ntask instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks.\nGuided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization,\ncapable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen\nenvironments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where\naccuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These\nfindings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.",

    "summary": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) relocate learnable nonlinearities from\nnodes to edges, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in scientific machine\nlearning and interpretable modeling. However, current KAN implementations\nsuffer from fundamental inefficiencies due to redundancy in high-dimensional\nspline parameter spaces, where numerous distinct parameterisations yield\nfunctionally equivalent behaviors. This redundancy manifests as a \"nuisance\nspace\" in the model's Jacobian, leading to susceptibility to overfitting and\npoor generalization. We introduce Projective Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(P-KANs), a novel training framework that guides edge function discovery\ntowards interpretable functional representations through entropy-minimisation\ntechniques from signal analysis and sparse dictionary learning. Rather than\nconstraining functions to predetermined spaces, our approach maintains spline\nspace flexibility while introducing \"gravitational\" terms that encourage\nconvergence towards optimal functional representations. Our key insight\nrecognizes that optimal representations can be identified through entropy\nanalysis of projection coefficients, compressing edge functions to\nlower-parameter projective spaces (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel). P-KANs\ndemonstrate superior performance across multiple domains, achieving up to 80%\nparameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity, significantly\nimproved robustness to noise compared to standard KANs, and successful\napplication to industrial automated fiber placement prediction. Our approach\nenables automatic discovery of mixed functional representations where different\nedges converge to different optimal spaces, providing both compression benefits\nand enhanced interpretability for scientific machine learning applications.",

    "summary": "Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the\nchallenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can\nfail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within\nthis context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented\nContrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and\nsupervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space\ncreated by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel\nScattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward\nprocess as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy\nviews of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a\nsupervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class\ndiscrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We\nevaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset,\nachieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm\nfor representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the\ncontrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a\nstrong foundation for class separability.",

This\ndialect gap has been related to various factors (e.g., data size, economic and\nsocial factors) whose impact, however, turns out to be inconsistent. In this\nwork, we investigate factors impacting the model performance more directly: we\ncorrelate Tokenization Parity (TP) and Information Parity (IP), as measures of\nrepresentational biases in pre-trained multilingual models, with the downstream\nperformance. We compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based\nmodels across three tasks: dialect classification, topic classification, and\nextractive question answering, controlling for varying scripts (Latin vs.\nnon-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Our analysis reveals that\nTP is a better predictor of the performance on tasks reliant on syntactic and\nmorphological cues (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance\nin semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification). Complementary analyses,\nincluding tokenizer behavior, vocabulary coverage, and qualitative insights,\nreveal that the language support claims of LLMs often might mask deeper\nmismatches at the script or token level.",

Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models\n(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs\nempower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing\nhigh-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions\ninto embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building\ninternal representations and future predictions of the external world,\nfacilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper\ncomprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,\ncovering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present\nthe history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied\nAI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal\nangle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,\nembodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,\nmeticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied\ncognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the\nabove advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint\nMLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound\nsignificance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we\nexamine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide\napplicability in real-world scenarios.

Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge\nto them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own\nconversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to\nthis failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental\nin the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a\nconversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I\nwill claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the\nestablishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a\nfundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of\nhallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the\ndisconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical\nconversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with\nseveral additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will\ndiscuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it\nworse.",

    "title": "A Set of Generalized Components to Achieve Effective Poison-only\n  Clean-label Backdoor Attacks with Collaborative Sample Selection and Triggers",
    "summary": "Poison-only Clean-label Backdoor Attacks aim to covertly inject\nattacker-desired behavior into DNNs by merely poisoning the dataset without\nchanging the labels. To effectively implant a backdoor, multiple\n\\textbf{triggers} are proposed for various attack requirements of Attack\nSuccess Rate (ASR) and stealthiness. Additionally, sample selection enhances\nclean-label backdoor attacks' ASR by meticulously selecting ``hard'' samples\ninstead of random samples to poison. Current methods 1) usually handle the\nsample selection and triggers in isolation, leading to severely limited\nimprovements on both ASR and stealthiness. Consequently, attacks exhibit\nunsatisfactory performance on evaluation metrics when converted to PCBAs via a\nmere stacking of methods. Therefore, we seek to explore the bidirectional\ncollaborative relations between the sample selection and triggers to address\nthe above dilemma. 2) Since the strong specificity within triggers, the simple\ncombination of sample selection and triggers fails to substantially enhance\nboth evaluation metrics, with generalization preserved among various attacks.\nTherefore, we seek to propose a set of components to significantly improve both\nstealthiness and ASR based on the commonalities of attacks. Specifically,\nComponent A ascertains two critical selection factors, and then makes them an\nappropriate combination based on the trigger scale to select more reasonable\n``hard'' samples for improving ASR. Component B is proposed to select samples\nwith similarities to relevant trigger implanted samples to promote\nstealthiness. Component C reassigns trigger poisoning intensity on RGB colors\nthrough distinct sensitivity of the human visual system to RGB for higher ASR,\nwith stealthiness ensured by sample selection, including Component B.\nFurthermore, all components can be strategically integrated into diverse PCBAs.",

Leveraging this insight, we interpret\neach neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that\nonly a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to\nthe output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic,\nrepresent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these\nobservations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free\nsemantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second,\nwe utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset\ndistribution shifts.

    "summary": "India's linguistic landscape is one of the most diverse in the world,\ncomprising over 120 major languages and approximately 1,600 additional\nlanguages, with 22 officially recognized as scheduled languages in the Indian\nConstitution. Despite recent progress in multilingual neural machine\ntranslation (NMT), high-quality parallel corpora for Indian languages remain\nscarce, especially across varied domains. In this paper, we introduce a\nlarge-scale, high-quality annotated parallel corpus covering 11 of these\nlanguages : English, Telugu, Hindi, Punjabi, Odia, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Dogri,\nKannada, Urdu, and Gujarati comprising a total of 772,000 bi-text sentence\npairs. The dataset is carefully curated and systematically categorized into\nthree key domains: Government, Health, and General, to enable domain-aware\nmachine translation research and facilitate effective domain adaptation. To\ndemonstrate the utility of CorIL and establish strong benchmarks for future\nresearch, we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art NMT models,\nincluding IndicTrans2, NLLB, and BhashaVerse. Our analysis reveals important\nperformance trends and highlights the corpus's value in probing model\ncapabilities. For instance, the results show distinct performance patterns\nbased on language script, with massively multilingual models showing an\nadvantage on Perso-Arabic scripts (Urdu, Sindhi) while other models excel on\nIndic scripts. This paper provides a detailed domain-wise performance analysis,\noffering insights into domain sensitivity and cross-script transfer learning.\nBy publicly releasing CorIL, we aim to significantly improve the availability\nof high-quality training data for Indian languages and provide a valuable\nresource for the machine translation research community.",

    "summary": "Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as\nmodels often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have\nrecently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level\nwhile preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite\nevidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this\nwork, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic\ntabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we\npropose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to\nreduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is\nnon-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed\nfeature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data\ndistributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and\ndemonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models,\nachieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as\nhigher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly\nefficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably,\nTABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across\nvarious dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized\ndatasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU,\nmaking it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.",

In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid\nprivacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question\nanswering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and\ncloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i)\nsemantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a\nlocally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive\nentities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic\ncoherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii)\nanonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate\nreconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent\nmany-to-one reverse mapping.

    "summary": "Achieving robust safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) while\npreserving their utility remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches\noften struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained\ncontrollability at the representation level. We introduce LATENTGUARD, a novel\nthree-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent\nspace control for interpretable and precise safety steering. Our approach\nbegins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both\nreasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and\nreasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust\nbehavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios.\nWe then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP\nactivations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types,\nattack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to\nlearn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial\ncharacteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted\nmanipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective\nrefusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving\nhelpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in both safety controllability and response\ninterpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on\nMistral-7B confirms the generalizability of our latent steering approach,\nshowing consistent effectiveness across different model families. Our results\nsuggest that structured representation-level intervention offers a promising\npathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.",

Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP)\nand large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification\nof textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in\nmany applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of\nthis relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive,\nneutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of\nSDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates\nprogress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such\nprogress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark\ndataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and\nsynthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six\nstate-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned\nconfigurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the\ncurrent generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly\nQWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure),\nSDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land).\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with\nsynthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this\ntask.

    "summary": "Many marketing applications, including credit card incentive programs, offer\nrewards to customers who exceed specific spending thresholds to encourage\nincreased consumption. Quantifying the causal effect of these thresholds on\ncustomers is crucial for effective marketing strategy design. Although\nregression discontinuity design is a standard method for such causal inference\ntasks, its assumptions can be violated when customers, aware of the thresholds,\nstrategically manipulate their spending to qualify for the rewards. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel framework for estimating the causal effect under\nthreshold manipulation. The main idea is to model the observed spending\ndistribution as a mixture of two distributions: one representing customers\nstrategically affected by the threshold, and the other representing those\nunaffected. To fit the mixture model, we adopt a two-step Bayesian approach\nconsisting of modeling non-bunching customers and fitting a mixture model to a\nsample around the threshold. We show posterior contraction of the resulting\nposterior distribution of the causal effect under large samples. Furthermore,\nwe extend this framework to a hierarchical Bayesian setting to estimate\nheterogeneous causal effects across customer subgroups, allowing for stable\ninference even with small subgroup sample sizes. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed methods through simulation studies and illustrate\ntheir practical implications using a real-world marketing dataset.",

    "summary": "There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs):\ndynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP).\nDynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of\nboth classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based\nmethods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained\nattention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based\nmethods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained\noptimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively\ncompared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to\nestablish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more\neffective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier\nfunction, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the\nLP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This\nreformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient\ndescent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a\nthorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been\ndeveloped. This paper aims to bridge this gap.",

    "summary": "The inherent non-deterministic nature of autonomous agents, particularly\nwithin low-code/no-code (LCNC) environments, presents significant reliability\nchallenges. Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate\noutputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a\nbreakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to\naddress these issues: the integration of a secondary, \"metacognitive\" layer\nthat actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,\nthis layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined\nset of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon\npredicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human\nhandoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's \"thought\nprocess\" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical\nanalysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly\nincreases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes\nwith a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human\nhandoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that\nenhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by\nproviding transparency into the agent's internal state.

    "summary": "The explosive growth of multimodal data - spanning text, image, video,\nspatial, and relational modalities, coupled with the need for real-time\nsemantic search and retrieval over these data - has outpaced the capabilities\nof existing multimodal and real-time database systems, which either lack\nefficient ingestion and continuous query capability, or fall short in\nsupporting expressive hybrid analytics. We introduce ARCADE, a real-time data\nsystem that efficiently supports high-throughput ingestion and expressive\nhybrid and continuous query processing across diverse data types. ARCADE\nintroduces unified disk-based secondary index on LSM-based storage for vector,\nspatial, and text data modalities, a comprehensive cost-based query optimizer\nfor hybrid queries, and an incremental materialized view framework for\nefficient continuous queries. Built on open-source RocksDB storage and MySQL\nquery engine, ARCADE outperforms leading multimodal data systems by up to 7.4x\non read-heavy and 1.4x on write-heavy workloads.",

    "title": "ExpFace: Exponential Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition",
    "summary": "Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power\nto ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.\nMargin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have\nbeen widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the\ndistribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples\npredominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift\ntoward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the\nExponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular\nexponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the\ncenter region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular\nspace, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We\npresent a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses\nin terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,\nshowing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and\nthe non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that\napplies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular\nspace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code\nat: https://github.com/dfr-code/ExpFace.",

In\nhigh-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate\nestimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to\nthe reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex,\nheterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning\nframework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision\n(e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct\ntask while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal\nvalidity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the\ntraining objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public\nspinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs.\nposterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset\n(368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs.\nnon-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves\nthe highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive\nperformance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in\ntreatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\\epsilon_{\\text{NN-PEHE}}$\n(0.2778) and $\\epsilon_{\\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs\nin AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains,\nwith $\\epsilon_{\\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\\epsilon_{\\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902.\nBy providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a\npowerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient\noutcomes.

Basic measures such as bandwidth and frame rate by themselves do not\nsuffice, and can only be interpreted in the context of the game played and the\nplayer activity within the game. This paper equips the network operator with a\nmethod to obtain a real-time measure of cloud gaming experience by analyzing\nnetwork traffic, including contextual factors such as the game title and player\nactivity stage. Our method is able to classify the game title within the first\nfive seconds of game launch, and continuously assess the player activity stage\nas being active, passive, or idle. We deploy it in an ISP hosting NVIDIA cloud\ngaming servers for the region. We provide insights from hundreds of thousands\nof cloud game streaming sessions over a three-month period into the dependence\nof bandwidth consumption and experience level on the gameplay contexts.",

While\nclassifier-free guidance (CFG) strategies have shown promising results in image\ngeneration, their application to speech synthesis are underexplored. Separating\nthe conditions used for CFG enables trade-offs between different desired\ncharacteristics in speech synthesis. In this paper, we evaluate the\nadaptability of CFG strategies originally developed for image generation to\nspeech synthesis and extend separated-condition CFG approaches for this domain.\nOur results show that CFG strategies effective in image generation generally\nfail to improve speech synthesis. We also find that we can improve speaker\nsimilarity while limiting degradation of text adherence by applying standard\nCFG during early timesteps and switching to selective CFG only in later\ntimesteps. Surprisingly, we observe that the effectiveness of a selective CFG\nstrategy is highly text-representation dependent, as differences between the\ntwo languages of English and Mandarin can lead to different results even with\nthe same model.",

Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and\nclass-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and\noverfitting.

Furthermore, we propose large-scale\ncontrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness.

    "summary": "Pedestrian safety is a critical component of urban mobility and is strongly\ninfluenced by the interactions between pedestrian decision-making and driver\nyielding behavior at crosswalks. Modeling driver--pedestrian interactions at\nintersections requires accurately capturing the complexity of these behaviors.\nTraditional machine learning models often struggle to capture the nuanced and\ncontext-dependent reasoning required for these multifactorial interactions, due\nto their reliance on fixed feature representations and limited\ninterpretability. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) are suited for\nextracting patterns from heterogeneous traffic data, enabling accurate modeling\nof driver-pedestrian interactions. Therefore, this paper leverages multimodal\nLLMs through a novel prompt design that incorporates domain-specific knowledge,\nstructured reasoning, and few-shot prompting, enabling interpretable and\ncontext-aware inference of driver yielding behavior, as an example application\nof modeling pedestrian--driver interaction. We benchmarked state-of-the-art\nLLMs against traditional classifiers, finding that GPT-4o consistently achieves\nthe highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excels in precision. These\nfindings highlight the critical trade-offs between model performance and\ncomputational efficiency, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in\nreal-world pedestrian safety systems.",

Across 40 training runs on Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B (both base and\ninstruct) and multiple optimization algorithms (DPO, PPO, and GRPO), RLMT\nconsistently outperforms standard RLHF pipelines.

The compute for pre-training LLMs has been\ngrowing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data\nremains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data\nconstitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that\ncertain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model\ncapacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally\ncomplex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented\nPre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with\nautomatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively\nincreases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more\nlearnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across\ndiverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training\nwith both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong\nopen-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method\nsubstantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and\nfamilies.

    "summary": "Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used worldwide,\nmaking it essential to ensure they are free from gender bias to prevent\nrepresentational harm. While prior studies have examined such biases in\nhigh-resource languages, low-resource languages remain understudied. In this\npaper, we propose a template-based probing methodology, validated against\nreal-world data, to uncover gender stereotypes in LLMs. As part of this\nframework, we introduce the Domain-Specific Gender Skew Index (DS-GSI), a\nmetric that quantifies deviations from gender parity. We evaluate four\nprominent models, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen QwQ 32B,\nacross four semantic domains, focusing on Persian, a low-resource language with\ndistinct linguistic features. Our results show that all models exhibit gender\nstereotypes, with greater disparities in Persian than in English across all\ndomains. Among these, sports reflect the most rigid gender biases. This study\nunderscores the need for inclusive NLP practices and provides a framework for\nassessing bias in other low-resource languages.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant\ninterest in extending their capabilities to multimodal scenarios, particularly\nfor speech-to-speech conversational systems. However, existing multimodal\nmodels handling interleaved audio and text rely on autoregressive methods,\noverlooking that text depends on target-target relations whereas audio depends\nmainly on source-target relations. In this work, we propose Text-to-Talk (TtT),\na unified audio-text framework that integrates autoregressive (AR) text\ngeneration with non-autoregressive (NAR) audio diffusion in a single\nTransformer. By leveraging the any-order autoregressive property of absorbing\ndiscrete diffusion, our approach provides a unified training objective for text\nand audio. To support this hybrid generation paradigm, we design a\nmodality-aware attention mechanism that enforces causal decoding for text while\nallowing bidirectional modeling within audio spans, and further introduce three\ntraining strategies that reduce train-test discrepancies. During inference, TtT\nemploys block-wise diffusion to synthesize audio in parallel while flexibly\nhandling variable-length outputs. Extensive experiments across Audio-QA and ASR\ntasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with detailed ablation\nstudies validating each proposed component. We will open-source our models,\ndata and code to facilitate future research in this direction.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into\nstrong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive\nprogramming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven\nprogress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:\nhuman-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora\nare often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales\ninto prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we\npresent PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted\nheuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are\niteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that\nare both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts\nsupport two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve\nautonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2)\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled\ntraces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.\nIn self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new\nstate-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME\n24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on\nCodeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts\nboosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5),\nsurpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm\nthat PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct\nproblems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling\nreasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future\nopen-source models.

    "summary": "Preference learning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have\nbecome standard for Large Language Model (LLM) post-training, yet they are\noften ineffective for mathematical reasoning. A key challenge is the large\ntoken overlap between preferred and dispreferred trajectories; lowering the\nprobability of dispreferred trajectories also reduces the probability of shared\nuseful tokens, leading to over-penalization and overall performance collapse.\nAs a mitigation, existing algorithms include the probability of a trajectory\nunder the current policy as a regularization term, which decreases the effect\nof the gradient when the probability is low. However, by the time this effect\ntakes hold, useful tokens may have already been over-penalized as the model has\nbegun to degrade. To address this, we propose Future Policy Aware (FPA)\npreference learning, which replaces the current policy with a future policy in\nthe regularization term. This future policy is estimated via lightweight,\nlogit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model. FPA\nenables safer training by preemptively regularizing potentially problematic\ngradients. We apply FPA to DPO, RPO, and SimPER and evaluate them on the MATH\nand GSM8K benchmarks. FPA yields consistent performance gains, with the largest\nimprovements observed with SimPER, achieving gains of up to 5.75%. We\ndemonstrate that FPA provides proactive regularization while preserving the\nprobability of shared, useful mathematical tokens, and enables longer,\ndegradation-free training with negligible computational overhead.

CHURRO-DS unifies 155 historical\ncorpora comprising 99,491 pages, spanning 22 centuries of textual heritage\nacross 46 language clusters, including historical variants and dead languages.\n  We evaluate several open-weight and closed VLMs and optical character\nrecognition (OCR) systems on CHURRO-DS and find that CHURRO outperforms all\nother VLMs. On the CHURRO-DS test set, CHURRO achieves 82.3% (printed) and\n70.1% (handwritten) normalized Levenshtein similarity, surpassing the\nsecond-best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, by 1.4% and 6.5%, respectively, while being\n15.5 times more cost-effective.\n  By releasing the model and dataset, we aim to enable community-driven\nresearch to improve the readability of historical texts and accelerate\nscholarship.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have expanded from text to speech, giving rise\nto Speech Large Models (SLMs) that support recognition, translation, and\nsynthesis. A key challenge is aligning speech and text representations, which\nbecomes harder in multilingual settings. Existing methods often freeze LLM\nparameters and train encoders on multilingual data, but this forces\ncross-language convergence and limits performance. We introduce Progressive\nAlignment Representation Training (PART), a multi-stage and multi-task\nframework that separates within-language from cross-language alignment. During\ncross-language training, LLM parameters are dynamically activated, and\ntext-based tasks are later introduced to enhance multilingual understanding.\nExperiments on CommonVoice 15, Fleurs, Wenetspeech, and CoVoST2 show that PART\nsurpasses conventional approaches, with analysis confirming its ability to\nbalance language-specific distinctions and cross-language generalization. These\nresults demonstrate PART's effectiveness and generality for multilingual speech\nmodality alignment.",

    "summary": "Driven by the demand for personalized AI systems, there is growing interest\nin aligning the behavior of large language models (LLMs) with human traits such\nas personality. Previous attempts to induce personality in LLMs have shown\npromising results, but they struggle to capture the continuous and\nmultidimensional nature of human traits. In this work, we propose a novel\nmethod for personality modulation in LLMs via model merging. Specifically, we\nconstruct personality vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model\nfrom those of the fine-tuned model on a given personality trait. By merging\npersonality vectors, we enable LLMs to exhibit desired personality traits\nwithout additional training. Extensive experiments show that personality\nvectors enable continuous control over trait intensity and support the\ncomposition of multiple traits. Furthermore, personality vectors transfer\nacross diverse downstream models, suggesting that they encode generalizable\nrepresentations of personality. Our code is available at here.",

    "summary": "Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo\ninformation within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views\nare visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection\nas an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a\nphysically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the\nvirtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a\nmulti-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,\nmaking it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for\ngeneralizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric\nsymmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine\npose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where\neach frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry\nrecovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable\nsynthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and\ncamera poses.

On\nMini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest\naverage ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to\nslightly lower.

    "summary": "Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to\nvariable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and\nimaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these\nchallenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the\nreal-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical\nscenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model\nselection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of\nadvanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)\n(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,\nconsisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for\nblueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with\nsmartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled\ninstances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide\nrange of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the\nYOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while\nRT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR\nvariants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and\nthe mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To\nfurther enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using\nUnbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of\n1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in\n2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with\nRT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into\nSSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data.

    "summary": "Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the\ninput data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic\nconstraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware\nRule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal\nclustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly\ninto the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture\nby embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features\ninto a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule\nconsistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional\nclustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post\nhoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules\nare generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a\nloss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and\nviolation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets\ndemonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful\nand interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth\naircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering\nmetrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may\nhallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to\ncomplex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By\ncombining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more\nmeaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,\nhighlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for\ncomplex, knowledge intensive settings.",

We enhance the diffusion model with a novel\nspatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and\nincorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical\nplausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,\nphysics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video\nmodels, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing\nmethods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

    "summary": "As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON)\ntechnology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves\nby overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet\nchallenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures\naccurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse\norientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose\nconditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting\nthe optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional\nparameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.\n  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the\nreference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex\nattention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this\npure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing\nperformance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional\nparameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose\nstitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose\npreservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask\ntraining strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model\nto support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.",

    "summary": "The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion,\nestimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S.,\nhighlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these\nmethods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming\nsystems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous\nsolutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress\nin this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the\nlack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field\ndeployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study\npresents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models\nfor deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of\nthis work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available\ndataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,\nderived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive\ncomparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO\narchitectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a\nhigh-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing\nplatforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the\nreal-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific\nmodel optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with\nGPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals\nthat smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and\nYOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and\ncomputational efficiency (FPS > 30).

    "summary": "Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations,\nyet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label.\nSegmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a\npromising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling\nefficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial\nregions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between\nanomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of\ncontrollable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring\ntwo novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the\nForeground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling\nalgorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly\nsynthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine\naggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented\nanomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the\nanomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,\npreserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.\nExtensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST\nconsistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream\nsegmentation tasks.

    "summary": "Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image\nsegmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high\naccuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid\narchitectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial\nstacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to\naddress the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information\nconflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively\npropose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular\nhierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in\nparallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information.\nThe modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling\ncapability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient\ninformation transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of\nfeatures and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods.\nFurthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve\nprecise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic\ninformation, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and\nresulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance\nmulti-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise\ninterference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to\nreplace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation\ntechniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness.

    "summary": "Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging\nmodalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually\nacquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage\nand operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower\ninter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent\nresolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based\nvolumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice\nresolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the\nthrough-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however,\nthe anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT\nslice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume.\nSpecifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane\ntexture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution\nthrough-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local\nattention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing\nthrough-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly\nbetter in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT\ndatasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework.

    "summary": "Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising\nresearch direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains\nvulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve\nmisleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing\nattacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily\ntarget vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD\nsystems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)\nAdversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital\nlevel. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage\nAttack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on\noptimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate\nphysically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization\nacross different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the\nobserved vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA\nintroduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational\ndiscrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates\na multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its\nadaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world\nscenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various\nVLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing\nstate-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,\nUCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic\nconditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.",

    "summary": "The development and evaluation of machine vision in underwater environments\nremains challenging, often relying on trial-and-error-based testing tailored to\nspecific applications. This is partly due to the lack of controlled,\nground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges,\nsuch as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced\ncontrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light\npatterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance\nof ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and\nseasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific\noptical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack\ngeneralizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is\ntechnically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \\textit{Optical\nOcean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled\nunderwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes,\nusing calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and\ncontrolled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance.\nHence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in\nrealistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment\nenables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks,\nincluding water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual\nSLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset\ngenerated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of\nour system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code\nwill be made available.",

However, the massive computational burden imposed by the\nretraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps\nduring the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in\nimage dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy\nimages in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and\npropose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed\nDiffLI$^2$D.

This requires a smart map that fuses accurate geometric\nstructure with rich, human-understandable semantics. To address this, we\nintroduce the 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR), a novel framework\nbuilt on multimedia data that unifies three complementary 3D representations:\n(1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic\nreconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured,\nscalable organization via 3D scene graphs. Built on an object-centric design,\nthe framework integrates with large vision-language models to enable semantic\nqueryability by linking multimodal object embeddings, and supporting\nobject-level retrieval of geometric, visual, and semantic information. The\nretrieved data are then loaded into a robotic task planner for downstream\nexecution.

Extensive experiments conducted on two\npublicly available datasets show consistent improvements over various methods,\nwith a notable increase from 60.58% to 65.58% in Dice score for the abdominal\nCT dataset.

    "title": "Improving Generalizability and Undetectability for Targeted Adversarial\n  Attacks on Multimodal Pre-trained Models",
    "summary": "Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data\nmodalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across\ndownstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security\nconcerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we\nshow that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained\nmodels still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and\nundetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs)\nexhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar\ntargets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can\nbe easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited\nundetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method\ncalled Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and\ntarget-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to\ndefenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide\ntheoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and\nundetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the\nspecified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results\ndemonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related\ntargets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.",

To address this issue,\nwe propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video\ngeneration guided by precise camera poses.

This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry,\novercoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to\nequirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar\nmodule that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking\nalong epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature\naggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated\npanoramic videos.

    "summary": "Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an\negocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability\nto translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,\nhowever, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where\nmainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather\nthan true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel\nhuman-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene\nVision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates\nmulti-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,\nharnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,\nwe embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic\nsupervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like\nattentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with\nhuman driving behaviors, forming a more human-like\nperception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a\nHierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality\ncontributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates\nthe relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple\nabstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from\nvisual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more\nnuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate\nOmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over\nten state-of-the-art models across various tasks.

    "summary": "Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest,\nparticularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar\ninteraction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single\nmodality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability\nto capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a\nsingle reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic\nchanges in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we\nintroduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion\nembedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and\naudio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal\nfeatures), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more\nauthentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion\nand accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)\nmodule that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,\nSynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model\n(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and\nhigh-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and\ntextual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and\nqualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa\noutperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,\nexpression preservation, and motion realism.

    "summary": "This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene\ncompletion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are\nrepresented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting\nmethods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based\ndiffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing\nregions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing\ndirectly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring\nspatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for\ntime-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly\nrepetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities\nwithin the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for\nstructural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.\nPractically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch\nmeasurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,\nsubsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in\n3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective\nsubstitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct\nextensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and\nthe results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance\ncompared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.\nAdditional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of\nthe proposed 3D inpainting strategy.

    "summary": "Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of\nEmbodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually\nrealistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent\napproaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to\nfixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical\nconsistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this\nwork, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies\ndiverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At\nits core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a\nsuite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative\nmodels to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical\nplausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This\nclosed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic\ninconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over\nsuccessive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary\nroom types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on\nphysical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to\ncomplex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose\n3D environment generation.

    "summary": "The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in\n3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding\nreliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature\nmatching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate\nintermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive\nviewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are\nreconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to\ntheir large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for\nscene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For\naccurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed\nby using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate\nhigh-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and\nground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature\nmatching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground\nimages, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences\nthrough intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the\nvalidation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature\nmatching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used\nmethods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can\nprovide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious\nincrease in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide\nenough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based\nscene rendering.",

Most recent decomposition methods\nsegment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called\nsuperpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment\nstandard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without\ndistortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called\nSphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide\n360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of\nthe 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path\nbetween a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering\nfeatures. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space\nto compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation\naccuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity\naspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,\naddressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.\nFinally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o\nspherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional\nimages. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical\nstate-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to\nnoise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based\napplications on 360o images.",

Traditional\nmodels such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but\nare restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and\ngalaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with\nthree key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial\ncorrelations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR)\ndomains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar\nmorphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning\noptical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain\nconsistent across spectral bands.

Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task\nsilos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no\nstandardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction\nbetween detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task\nadversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single\nperturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing\nmonocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that\nsupports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common\ndetectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation\n(EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that\ncouples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth\nbias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far\nmisperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also\npropose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and\nreal-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear\nasymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer.

    "summary": "Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on\nresource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision,\nas its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent\nsurveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a\nmainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally\nface the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,\nhindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a\nlight-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR\nreconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the\nContext-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the\nYCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then\nemploys an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress\nghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce\nInverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced\nMulti-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at\nmultiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main\nversion for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in\ncomputational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between\nperformance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared\nto the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and\nincreases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge\ndevice. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and\nghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and\npracticality across various dynamic scenarios.",

    "summary": "Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize\nsegmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs\nby sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in\nlower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.\nWhile previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,\nno study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.\nThis study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC\nin an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied\nequally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants\nto ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary\nshift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,\naverage DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around\n0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,\nwith sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that\nfairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect\nidentical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A\nsegmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error\nmagnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work\nraises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences\nin segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from\nthe metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and\nfair evaluations in medical image analysis.",

To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier\nPrompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature\nextraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality\nFusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts\nthrough multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature\nextraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.\nThen, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency\ndomain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and\nunderstanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,\nunlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we\nuse combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality\nprompt.

Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation\nmethod as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The\nproposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac\namyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved\nfrom using all clips and from other benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare cardiomyopathy, with typical abnormalities\nin clinical measurements from echocardiograms such as reduced global\nlongitudinal strain of the myocardium. An alternative approach for detecting CA\nis via neural networks, using video classification models such as convolutional\nneural networks. These models process entire video clips, but provide no\nassurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to\nbe associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to\napply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the\nclassification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration\nfrom this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the\nanatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium,\nwhich we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image\npatches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be\napplied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder\npre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches.\nWe show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the\nmyocardium where CA imaging features are localized, we achieve increased\nperformance on a CA classification task compared to full video transformers.\nOur model provides an explicit guarantee that the classification is focused on\nonly anatomical regions of the echo, and enables us to visualize transformer\nattention scores over the deforming myocardium.",

    "summary": "Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from\ncontinuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key\nchallenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial\nforgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown\nadvanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we\nunderscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise\nknowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge\ncoherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across\nclients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt\nclass-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During\nprompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge\nconflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,\nintensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method\nthat explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt\ncommunication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism\n(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across\nclients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a\nclass-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate\ninter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant\nknowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks\ndemonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance.

This challenge is especially pertinent\nfor MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this\nstudy, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow\ndetection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.\nCloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened\nout as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the\nquantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques\nincluding Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),\nwith advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel\nAttention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods\nstruggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the\ndetection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially\nimprove detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,\nwhile SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details.

However, training LLM agents for\ncomplex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse\nepisode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the\ncomputational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction\nsettings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms\nmulti-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling\nefficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nwith dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical\nanalysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in\nhigher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the\ngeneralization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on\nthe complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model\ntrained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger\nbaseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for\nlong-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps.

From inverse problems to numerical\nPDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the\nboundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in\nparallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods\nevolving largely as separate pipelines. With \\emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a\nunifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space\nfor the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in\nthe digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent\nspace governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,\nmodel reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a\nsingle principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of\nLatent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three\nrepresentative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical\nregimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting\nLatent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and\n(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing\nand forecasting from sparse, noisy observations.

    "summary": "In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use\nwithout accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may\nbe extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural\nNetworks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in\nneural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an\naccurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining\naccurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for\npractical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of\nhyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional\nNNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the\neffects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity\nanalysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results\nindicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect\nboth predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world\napplications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods\nsuch as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality\nreduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.",

    "summary": "Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is\nprojected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit\nfrom machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their\ngeneralizability on an external cohort.\n  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and\n(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,\nstandardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training\nfolds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and\nfrozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination\n(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation\nused the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics\non PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.\n  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC\n~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On\nPIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;\nAUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded\nmetrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;\nRecall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall\n0.858; F1 0.857).\n  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently\ndominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with\nacceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based\nhybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk\nstratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with\ndeployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.",

To address this, we introduce MDBench, an\nopen-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on\ndynamical systems.

We also introduce seven challenging\nPDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations\nin current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic\nprogramming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,\nrespectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.\nMDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a\nrigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of\ndynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and\nimprovement of equation accuracy and robustness.",

Recent advances in generative diffusion models\nhave shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,\nbut rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited.

First, we\nshow that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a\nlow-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be\ninterpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to\ninterpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as\ngeneralized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When\nthe sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,\nwe can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the\nnoise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:\nuniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank\nGaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global\nconvergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.",

    "summary": "We address the problem of efficiently computing Wasserstein distances for\nmultiple pairs of distributions drawn from a meta-distribution. To this end, we\npropose a fast estimation method based on regressing Wasserstein distance on\nsliced Wasserstein (SW) distances. Specifically, we leverage both standard SW\ndistances, which provide lower bounds, and lifted SW distances, which provide\nupper bounds, as predictors of the true Wasserstein distance. To ensure\nparsimony, we introduce two linear models: an unconstrained model with a\nclosed-form least-squares solution, and a constrained model that uses only half\nas many parameters. We show that accurate models can be learned from a small\nnumber of distribution pairs. Once estimated, the model can predict the\nWasserstein distance for any pair of distributions via a linear combination of\nSW distances, making it highly efficient. Empirically, we validate our approach\non diverse tasks, including Gaussian mixtures, point-cloud classification, and\nWasserstein-space visualizations for 3D point clouds. Across various datasets\nsuch as MNIST point clouds, ShapeNetV2, MERFISH Cell Niches, and scRNA-seq, our\nmethod consistently provides a better approximation of Wasserstein distance\nthan the state-of-the-art Wasserstein embedding model, Wasserstein Wormhole,\nparticularly in low-data regimes.

This design captures dynamic statistical\ninterdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits\nan efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length.

    "summary": "Optimizing the timing and frequency of ads is a central problem in digital\nadvertising, with significant economic consequences. Existing scheduling\npolicies rely on simple heuristics, such as uniform spacing and frequency caps,\nthat overlook long-term user interest. However, it is well-known that users'\nlong-term interest and engagement result from the interplay of several\npsychological effects (Curmei, Haupt, Recht, Hadfield-Menell, ACM CRS, 2022).\n  In this work, we model change in user interest upon showing ads based on\nthree key psychological principles: mere exposure, hedonic adaptation, and\noperant conditioning. The first two effects are modeled using a concave\nfunction of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is\nmodeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user\ninterest due to overexposure. Under our psychological behavior model, we ask\nthe following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads\nshould be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the\nads?\n  Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of\ndisplayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the\noperant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm\nthat outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the\nperformance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small.\nOur algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and\nshows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many\nnatural settings. The optimal number of ads to display, which also depends on\nthe mere exposure and hedonistic adaptation functions, can be found through a\nsimple linear search given the above algorithm.

    "summary": "Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of\nheterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet\nthis task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of\nmicrostructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the\nmicrostructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the\ndevelopment of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property\nlinkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven\napproaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To\naddress this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation\n(xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It\nefficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local\nelastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately\npredicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a\nmaximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate\npredictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant\ndata efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results\nacross representative material systems, including two phase composites and\nsingle and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains\nessential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen\nmicrostructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods\nin predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while\nrequiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary,\nxLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from\nmicrostructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.",

We demonstrate its\nhigh fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two\ndifferent climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German\nICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile\ninformation as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31\ntimes faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4\npercent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also\ndemonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry\nschemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON.

    "summary": "As AI inference scales to billions of queries and emerging reasoning and\nagentic workflows increase token demand, reliable estimates of per-query energy\nuse are increasingly important for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and\nefficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate\nenergy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to\nreflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using\nproduction-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and\nassumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we\nestimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion\nqueries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8\nGWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,\nsimilar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how\ndata centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains\nduring the internet and cloud build-up.",

The framework operates in two\nstages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect\nstates associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing\nmodule that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy\ntowards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in\nmulti-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal\nperception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through\na latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision\nactivations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.\nExtensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE\nachieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer\ncumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially\nincreases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task\ncompletion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,\nfeasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of\nlearned robot policies.",

Existing human-in-the-loop\nreinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,\nlimiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we\nintroduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when\nlearning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We\nevaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing\nagainst three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our\nexperiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the\nperformance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.\nIt also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and\nsignificantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest\nthat selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient\nand scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.",

    "summary": "For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they\nmust reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a\npath. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered\nstaircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot\nthat pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable\nstance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,\nsuch as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be\ndifficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that\naddresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal\nrobot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during\nmanipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled\nperception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason\nabout feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core\ncontribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses\nproprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an\nobject's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the\nperception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,\nclosing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even\nafter partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from\nphysical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to\nit being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston\nDynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher\ntask success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared\nto open-loop baselines.",

Undirected graphs enforce symmetry in\ninformation exchange, leading to convergence to the average of initial states,\nwhile directed graphs permit asymmetry but make consensus dependent on root\nnodes and their influence. Both paradigms impose inherent restrictions on\nachievable consensus values and network robustness. This paper introduces a\ntheoretical framework for achieving consensus over a class of network\ntopologies, termed pseudo-undirected graphs, which retains bidirectional\nconnectivity between node pairs but allows the corresponding edge weights to\ndiffer, including the possibility of negative values under bounded conditions.\nThe resulting Laplacian is generally non-symmetric, yet it guarantees consensus\nunder connectivity assumptions, to expand the solution space, which enables the\nsystem to achieve a stable consensus value that can lie outside the convex hull\nof the initial state set. We derive admissibility bounds for negative weights\nfor a pseudo-undirected path graph, and show an application in the simultaneous\ninterception of a moving target.",

    "summary": "Learning visuomotor policies from expert demonstrations is an important\nfrontier in modern robotics research, however, most popular methods require\ncopious efforts for collecting teleoperation data and struggle to generalize\nout-ofdistribution. Scaling data collection has been explored through\nleveraging human videos, as well as demonstration augmentation techniques. The\nlatter approach typically requires expensive simulation rollouts and trains\npolicies with synthetic image data, therefore introducing a sim-to-real gap. In\nparallel, alternative state representations such as keypoints have shown great\npromise for category-level generalization. In this work, we bring these avenues\ntogether in a unified framework: PAD (Parse-AugmentDistill), for learning\ngeneralizable bimanual policies from a single human video. Our method relies on\nthree steps: (a) parsing a human video demo into a robot-executable\nkeypoint-action trajectory, (b) employing bimanual task-and-motion-planning to\naugment the demonstration at scale without simulators, and (c) distilling the\naugmented trajectories into a keypoint-conditioned policy. Empirically, we\nshowcase that PAD outperforms state-ofthe-art bimanual demonstration\naugmentation works relying on image policies with simulation rollouts, both in\nterms of success rate and sample/cost efficiency.

The system incrementally\nfuses raw LiDAR point-cloud data into a voxel grid using a directional\nbitmask-based integration scheme, producing dense and consistent TSDF\nrepresentations suitable for real-time 3D reconstruction. A key feature of the\napproach is that the processing time per point-cloud remains constant,\nregardless of the voxel grid resolution, enabling high resolution mapping\nwithout sacrificing runtime performance. In contrast to most recent TSDF/ESDF\nmethods that rely on GPU acceleration, our method operates entirely on CPU,\nachieving competitive results in speed.

Our approach decomposes demonstration generation into two steps: (1)\noffline demonstration annotation that extracts keyframes, salient objects, and\npose-object relations; and (2) online keypose retargeting that adapts those\nkeyframes to a new scene, given an initial observation. Using these modified\nkeypoints, our system warps the original demonstration to generate a new\ntrajectory, which is then executed, and the resulting demo, if successful, is\nsaved. Because the annotation is reusable across scenes, we use Thompson\nsampling to optimize the annotation, significantly improving generation success\nrate. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, and find that our data\nannotation method consistently outperforms expert-engineered baselines.

    "summary": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controllers for quadrupedal locomotion have\ndemonstrated impressive performance on challenging terrains, allowing robots to\nexecute complex skills such as climbing, running, and jumping. However,\nexisting blind locomotion controllers often struggle to ensure safety and\nefficient traversal through risky gap terrains, which are typically highly\ncomplex, requiring robots to perceive terrain information and select\nappropriate footholds during locomotion accurately. Meanwhile, existing\nperception-based controllers still present several practical limitations,\nincluding a complex multi-sensor deployment system and expensive computing\nresource requirements. This paper proposes a DRL controller named MAstering\nRisky Gap Terrains (MARG), which integrates terrain maps and proprioception to\ndynamically adjust the action and enhance the robot's stability in these tasks.\nDuring the training phase, our controller accelerates policy optimization by\nselectively incorporating privileged information (e.g., center of mass,\nfriction coefficients) that are available in simulation but unmeasurable\ndirectly in real-world deployments due to sensor limitations. We also designed\nthree foot-related rewards to encourage the robot to explore safe footholds.\nMore importantly, a terrain map generation (TMG) model is proposed to reduce\nthe drift existing in mapping and provide accurate terrain maps using only one\nLiDAR, providing a foundation for zero-shot transfer of the learned policy. The\nexperimental results indicate that MARG maintains stability in various risky\nterrain tasks.",

    "summary": "Robots deployed in real-world environments, such as homes, must not only\nnavigate safely but also understand their surroundings and adapt to environment\nchanges. To perform tasks efficiently, they must build and maintain a semantic\nmap that accurately reflects the current state of the environment. Existing\nresearch on semantic exploration largely focuses on static scenes without\npersistent object-level instance tracking. A consistent map is, however,\ncrucial for real-world robotic applications where objects in the environment\ncan be removed, reintroduced, or shifted over time. In this work, to close this\ngap, we propose an open-vocabulary, semantic exploration system for semi-static\nenvironments. Our system maintains a consistent map by building a probabilistic\nmodel of object instance stationarity, systematically tracking semi-static\nchanges, and actively exploring areas that have not been visited for a\nprolonged period of time. In addition to active map maintenance, our approach\nleverages the map's semantic richness with LLM-based reasoning for\nopen-vocabulary object-goal navigation. This enables the robot to search more\nefficiently by prioritizing contextually relevant areas. We evaluate our\napproach across multiple real-world semi-static environments. Our system\ndetects 95% of map changes on average, improving efficiency by more than 29% as\ncompared to random and patrol baselines. Overall, our approach achieves a\nmapping precision within 2% of a fully rebuilt map while requiring\nsubstantially less exploration and further completes object goal navigation\ntasks about 14% faster than the next-best tested strategy (coverage\npatrolling).

(3) We propose an integrated policy\nlearning pipeline, where a dynamics-informed perception module predicts\ntopological evolution and produces particle-wise, topology-aware embeddings to\nsupport PDDP (Particle-based Score-Entropy Discrete Diffusion Policy) for\ngoal-conditioned policy learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nTopoCut supports trajectory generation, scalable learning, precise evaluation,\nand strong generalization across diverse object geometries, scales, poses, and\ncutting goals.",

    "title": "Formal Safety Verification and Refinement for Generative Motion Planners\n  via Certified Local Stabilization",
    "summary": "We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based\ngenerative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages\nover traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of\ntheir outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale\nonly to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve\nGMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate\nthe GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural\ntracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This\nyields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the\ncontroller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a\nlibrary of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that\nimitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving\nsafety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including\ndiffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in\nsimulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware\n(differential-drive robot).",

    "title": "Memory-Augmented Potential Field Theory: A Framework for Adaptive\n  Control in Non-Convex Domains",
    "summary": "Stochastic optimal control methods often struggle in complex non-convex\nlandscapes, frequently becoming trapped in local optima due to their inability\nto learn from historical trajectory data. This paper introduces\nMemory-Augmented Potential Field Theory, a unified mathematical framework that\nintegrates historical experience into stochastic optimal control. Our approach\ndynamically constructs memory-based potential fields that identify and encode\nkey topological features of the state space, enabling controllers to\nautomatically learn from past experiences and adapt their optimization\nstrategy. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that memory-augmented\npotential fields possess non-convex escape properties, asymptotic convergence\ncharacteristics, and computational efficiency. We implement this theoretical\nframework in a Memory-Augmented Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)\ncontroller that demonstrates significantly improved performance in challenging\nnon-convex environments. The framework represents a generalizable approach to\nexperience-based learning within control systems (especially robotic dynamics),\nenhancing their ability to navigate complex state spaces without requiring\nspecialized domain knowledge or extensive offline training.",
