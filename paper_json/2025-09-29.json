    "title": "UniAPL: A Unified Adversarial Preference Learning Framework for\n  Instruct-Following",
    "summary": "Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.\nWe argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference\nLearning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,\nSupervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement\nLearning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due\nto a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the\npolicy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge\nbrittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,\nground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,\nungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data\nsources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization\nproblem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel\nframework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.\nUniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning\nfrom mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense\nexpert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,\ninherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We\nevaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507\nas the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on\nQwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the\nteacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm\nthat UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both\nstronger performance and better behavioral alignment.",

    "summary": "We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline\nthat synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel\ndata. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,\npractitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,\nor only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom\nboth. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely\non costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses\nthis by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise\nintermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs\nfrom IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,\nyielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five\nbenchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization\n(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired\nsetting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained\nonly on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora\nand other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated\npairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of\ndirect synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only\nPbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,\nhighlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the\nmismatch, limiting direct synthesis.",

While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we\nhypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial\nprocessing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance\nacross tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct\ndomains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.\nTasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors\nsuch as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and\ntransformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a\nconsistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with\nincreased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As\ntasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,\nenumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human\nperformance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,\nindicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a\nfundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.",

    "summary": "With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent\nreal-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key\nlimitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction\nhistory, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We\npropose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable\nreasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed\nexperiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from\nReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,\nenabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful\nexperience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling\n(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up\nthe agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,\nthe agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive\nsignals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn\nguides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory\nand test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,\nReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store\nraw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness\nand efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish\nmemory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to\nself-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.",

We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided\nRewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'\nnatural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which\nlearns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term\ninteraction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term\nuser personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference\noptimization.

    "summary": "Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing\nones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in\nLLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with\nRL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue\nthat RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.\nThis work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills\nduring RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms\nby which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination\nand other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task\ncomplexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.\nSpecifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string\ntransformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g\nprior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen\ncompositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability\ngeneralizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions\nunseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that\ncompositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target\ntask. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,\nrequiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative\nanalysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the\nmodels. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of\nthese findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM\nlearning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,\nthen using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex\nproblems.",

    "summary": "Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities\n-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across\nmodel sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends\nbeyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal\ntrajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this\nphenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,\nwhere width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled\njointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely\nwhen optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,\nin accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a\nsignature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at\nscale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of\ntraining pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables\nearly stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a\ncompetitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse\nas an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.",

    "summary": "Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific\ndiscovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,\nrely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source\nmodels struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and\nlong-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This\npaper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe\ndesigned to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key\nchallenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient\ndata resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn\nrollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a\nrecursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and\ndifficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling\nstrategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically\nadjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a\nmemory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on\nDataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning\ndiverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic\ntasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with\nan average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming\nthe strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B\nalso performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also\nincorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the\nanalysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic\ntraining for the community.

    "summary": "High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While\nrecent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic\ncontent, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline\nthat first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled\ndesign tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.\nIn this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry\nand appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage\ngeneration. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which\ncompresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation\n-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense\nlow-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D\nformats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,\nwe train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into\nUniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,\nUniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,\nachieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality.

    "summary": "The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex\nenvironments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement\nlearning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge\nopaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in\nwhich an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,\nergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language\nModel (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its\nenvironment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state\nwith no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of\ninteraction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete\ntrajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where\nit refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and\nPlaybook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable\nstrategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,\nMinesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent\nsuccessfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their\nrules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies\nconfirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work\ndemonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only\nact effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world\nthrough explicit reasoning on raw experience.",

    "summary": "Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive\nagents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and\nrobotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality\ndownstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and\nverifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human\nannotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,\nwhich is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited\ncoverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task\ngeneration that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover\npossible interactions and current state information to synthesize\nenvironment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration\nphase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment\nstates and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task\ngenerator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline\nprompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks.

In this paper, we\nintroduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in\npatients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large\nvision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.\nTemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual\nquestion-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a\nsupplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we\nconduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results\nshow that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes\nover temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a\nrandom-guessing level in the closed-book setting.

Recent work explores\nusing large language models (LLMs) to simulate respondents via persona-based\nprompts, often without labeled data. We study a more practical setting where\npartial survey responses exist: we fine-tune LLMs on available data to impute\nself-reported vote choice under both random and systematic nonresponse, using\nthe German Longitudinal Election Study. We compare zero-shot prompting and\nsupervised fine-tuning against tabular classifiers (e.g., CatBoost) and test\nhow different convenience samples (e.g., students) used for fine-tuning affect\ngeneralization.\n  Our results show that when data are missing completely at random, fine-tuned\nLLMs match tabular classifiers but outperform zero-shot approaches. When only\nbiased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B)\nopen-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and\npopulation-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better\nthan tabular methods.

    "summary": "Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the\nAI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct\n(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation\nmodels by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language\nmodel (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM\ncounterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical\npart of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of\nintegral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We\nalso introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state\nmatching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly\nimprove the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference\nperformances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated\nlanguage generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard\ndLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128\nNFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss\nof about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further\nvalidate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive\nablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein\nsequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective\ndistillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye.

    "summary": "Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for\ndeploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open\nchallenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting\na model's \"self-knowledge\", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its\nown answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some\nprivileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the\nmodel itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict\nthe correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an\nunrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a\n\"Correctness Model\" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical\npredictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness\ninformation, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that\nGCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns\nfor correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use\nCMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its\ngeneralization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that\nanswer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore\nalternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that\nincluding history as in-context examples can help improve correctness\nprediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in\ncalibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families\nand the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective\nprediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a\ngeneralizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding\ncorrectness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on\nself-introspection.",

    "summary": "Software development relies heavily on extensive unit testing, which makes\nthe efficiency of automated Unit Test Generation (UTG) particularly important.\nHowever, most existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time in each\nforward pass, which leads to inefficient UTG. Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs)\nhave emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing\nstrong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application\nto UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test\nquality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often\ncauses a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this\nlimitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically\ntailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests\ntargeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By\ndynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree\nanalysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of\ntokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To\nenable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark,\nwhich was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages\nincluding Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two\nrepresentative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration\nwhile preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across\ndifferent dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable\nsolution for efficient UTG in software development.

In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely\nlarge corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and\nresampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our\ndesigned metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge\nwith far less data.

    "summary": "This study introduces \"Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings\nDifferentials\" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural\nnetwork embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric\nsurvey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language\nmodels, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values\nobtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire\n(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across\na number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully\naddresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions\nwithout requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals\nthat our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in\ndimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional\nscaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence\ncoefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results\ndemonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric\nstructures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach\noffers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while\nmaintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have\nsignificant implications for psychometrics and social science research,\nproviding a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human\nbehavior and experience represented in measurement tools.",

Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,\nand MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nstrong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation\nstudies.

    "summary": "With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly\nimportant to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even\nwhen their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this\nproblem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance\nbetween the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a\nsignificant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in\nreasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in\napplicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a\nnovel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method\nintroduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to\nreason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly\ndefined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance\nscore. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning\ntrajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance\nestimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel\nreinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism,\nwhich employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each\ntraining sample.

Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in\nhigh-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.\nWhile LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and\nrespond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is\nhampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated\nbenchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In\nthis work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six\nclinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse\nevaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing\nresponse appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art\nLLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate\nresponses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and\ngenerally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks\nremain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or\nharmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher\nfailure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify\nsystemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance\non formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with\nuser context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced\nsafeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM\ndeployments.

However,\nmost existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting\nthe internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning\npotential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that\nLLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of\nthe training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this\nrelationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel\nmetric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by\ndecomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze\nhow well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify\nperformance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we\nintroduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the\nlogical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data\nvolume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's\nlogical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach\nsignificantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric\nstrategies.

However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions,\nfrequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information.\nThis limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on\nmodel self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge\nboundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose\n\\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \\textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that\nintegrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making.\nOur approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized\nevidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the\nmedical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an\nevidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt\nexploration based on patient context and conversation history.

Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in\nhandling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript\nconditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks\nremains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which\nseamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching\nframework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle\ndistinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer\nexhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition.\nTherefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle\ndifferent representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and\nself-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary\nto the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex\ntraining strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits\nfrom the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation\nwithout extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to\nthe learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates\nconvergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the\nclassifier-free guidance process.

    "summary": "Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference\nphase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are\nlargely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively\nlearn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to\nlearn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a\nself-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning\nsystem (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a\nfast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve\ncomprises two evolutionary components: \\textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly\nretrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM\nreasoning; and \\textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent\noptimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of\nexperiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes\nfacilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive\ndynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight\nbenchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses\nstate-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\\%$ and\nexhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.",

Recently, methods that\ndynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse\nattention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of\nLLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance\ndegradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a\ntraining-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block\nestimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our\nobservation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores\nof pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To\naccount for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware\ndynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative\nproxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained\nblock importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety\nof mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity\namong attention heads.

To address these limitations, we\nintroduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates\nhigh-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution\nof three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver\ncontinuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both\nsuccessful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly\nchallenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator\ndistills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,\nhigh-fidelity curriculum generation.

    "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex\nreasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that\nexpose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs\noften engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong\nanswers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a\nfundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship\nbetween questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we\ninvestigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We\nbegin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through\nexpressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning\nexpressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence\ntrajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for\nunsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last\ninput token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems\nlinearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we\npropose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression\nmonitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these\nboundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without\nsacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by\ncutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.",

To address this gap, we\npropose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a\nhuman-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \\textit{memory trigger}, which\nmonitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and\na \\textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to\nconstruct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its\nreasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent\nmemory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and\ncognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen\nsurpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to\n$38.22\\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain\ngeneralization ability.

Despite active exploration of unlearning\nmethods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the\ndifficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this\ngap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt\nattribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt\ntoken's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to\nreveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and\nthree benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by\ndisrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly\nerased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts,\nwithout modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from\nindiscriminate penalization of all tokens.

However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer\narchitecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing\nlong sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising\nsolution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters\nand disrupt the conventional \\textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}\nworkflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention\nframework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that\nseamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2\nreuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture\nmodification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence\nprocessing.

Our experiments on\nlong-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that\nInfLLM-V2 is 4$\\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and\n99.7% of the performance, respectively.

To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first\nend-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical\nreasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first\ngenerates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the\ncorrectness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem\ndifficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs\nwith low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer\nreasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers,\nit encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions.\nOn six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length\nreduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation.\nIntriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct\nreasoning modes, which we characterize as \"non-thinking\" and \"thinking\",\ndemonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes\ndynamically.",

    "summary": "Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of\nlearning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across\nsequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due\nto the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge\ninterference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation\nstrategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To\naddress these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based\nframework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts\narchitecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with\nlow-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection\nmechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling\nexpert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve\ngeneralization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive\nlearning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level\nsemantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on\nthe memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that\ntransfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide\nrange of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding\nthe generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite\nsignificant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,\nadversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.\nExisting mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,\nwhich introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is\nincompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce\nSelf-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive\npsychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during\nconversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that\ncontinuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level\nvia representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place\ncorrection of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.\nThis design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with\nnegligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that\nprivacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous\nstudies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy\nleakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior\nmitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility\nof LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.\nOur code is available at the following link:\nhttps://github.com/wjfu99/LLM_Self_Sanitize",

Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal\ndataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid\ngeometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean\nprinciples from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,\ninspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and\nperform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles.

We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of\nreasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.\nHowever, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout\ndiversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first\ndelve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical\ninsights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps\nof safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe\ncontinuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe\ntrajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened\nPreference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning\nby substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs\nfor preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and\nadversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall\nsafety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and\nRL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while\npreserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results\nhighlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a\npractical path to safer LRMs.",

We\npoint out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement\nmid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we\nformally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient\ntraining due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced\ntoken entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To\naddress these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive,\nand unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In\nparticular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains\nunnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a\ncurriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning\ntrajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training\nstrategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction,\nensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token\ninformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with\nonly 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling.

In such\nsettings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative\nversions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying\ncurriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and\ndata augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts\nenhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2)\nDoes ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer,\nwe build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are\naligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated\nexposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze\nmodels' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via\nfine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge,\nentity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning.

However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from\nrejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness,\nespecially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative\nVerification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts\nspeculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput.\nSV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to\nthe draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model\ndistributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this\nalignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on\nrejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no\nmodifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD\nvariants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three\nNLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models,\nincluding 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no\nfinetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned.

    "summary": "The past two years have witnessed the meteoric rise of Large Language Model\n(LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS), which harness collective intelligence\nand exhibit a remarkable trajectory toward self-evolution. This paradigm has\nrapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke\nconfiguration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward\nframeworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic\nmulti-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM\nagent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}''\nparadigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the\ndynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this\nlimitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of\nrecursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects\nbespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a\n``\\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of\ndynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in\nresponse to real-time task demands. Collaborative Tree Optimization is proposed\nto train and specialize these meta-agents. Extensive evaluation across seven\nbenchmarks reveals that MAS$^2$ achieves performance gains of up to $19.6\\%$\nover state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios such as deep research and code\ngeneration. Moreover, MAS$^2$ exhibits superior cross-backbone generalization,\neffectively leveraging previously unseen LLMs to yield improvements of up to\n$15.1\\%$. Crucially, these gains are attained without incurring excessive token\ncosts, as MAS$^2$ consistently resides on the Pareto frontier of\ncost-performance trade-offs.

We analyze this at\nthe mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature\ndirections representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,\nand (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We\ndemonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common\ncomponents that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess\nunique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms\nlead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and\nresponse diversity (intrinsic > prompted).

    "summary": "The ability to represent emotion plays a significant role in human cognition\nand social interaction, yet the high-dimensional geometry of this affective\nspace and its neural underpinnings remain debated. A key challenge, the\n`behavior-neural gap,' is the limited ability of human self-reports to predict\nbrain activity. Here we test the hypothesis that this gap arises from the\nconstraints of traditional rating scales and that large-scale similarity\njudgments can more faithfully capture the brain's affective geometry. Using AI\nmodels as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out\njudgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only\nmodel (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos. We found that\nthe emergent 30-dimensional embeddings from these models are highly\ninterpretable and organize emotion primarily along categorical lines, yet in a\nblended fashion that incorporates dimensional properties. Most remarkably, the\nMLLM's representation predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing\nnetworks with the highest accuracy, outperforming not only the LLM but also,\ncounterintuitively, representations derived directly from human behavioral\nratings. This result supports our primary hypothesis and suggests that sensory\ngrounding--learning from rich visual data--is critical for developing a truly\nneurally-aligned conceptual framework for emotion. Our findings provide\ncompelling evidence that MLLMs can autonomously develop rich, neurally-aligned\naffective representations, offering a powerful paradigm to bridge the gap\nbetween subjective experience and its neural substrates.

To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a\nprincipled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for\nstandardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS\nconsistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\\%$\nalignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS\ndemonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research\nwithout sacrificing theoretical nuance.",

    "summary": "Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an\nencoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and\noverlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative\nIterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework\nthat leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic\nrepresentations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under\ncontrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics\nthat encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an\nIterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each\nrefinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show\nthat GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB\nbenchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an\nemergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference\nsteadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative\nrefinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.",

To address these challenges, we propose\nsolutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct\nSCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,\nbiology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real\nLLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations\nthat generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert\nannotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of\nverification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of\nreasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified\nreasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,\nSCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment\ncapabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs.

This effect stems from models\nbeing trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to\nself-correct.

We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a\nnew paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual\nembedding space.

The language\nmodel is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual\ntokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent\nvisual reasoning.

However, these platforms are increasingly misused to\ndisseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive\nadvertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative\nconsequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response,\nresearchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio\ncontent moderation tools to tackle this issue.

Moreover, the\neffectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs\nremains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a\nMetamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software.\nSpecifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14\nmetamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based\nand Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic\naudio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more\nlikely to evade detection. In our evaluation, we employ MTAM to test five\ncommercial textual content moderation software and an academic model against\nthree kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTAM achieves up to 38.6%,\n18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% error finding rates (EFR) when testing\ncommercial moderation software provided by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu,\nNextdata, and Tencent, respectively, and it obtains up to 45.7% EFR when\ntesting the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy.",

    "summary": "Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks\navailable on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it\nunclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this\npaper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this\nproblem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks\nthat risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates\nmathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh\nand uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of\n117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks)\nfor basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations)\nfor sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68\nvariations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each\ntask generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique\ninstances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We\nevaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source\nmodels, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization\nschemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model\nfamilies, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases\nfrom polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as\nGemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of\n56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance\ndrops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano\nshowing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite.

    "summary": "Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is\nattracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world\napplications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further\ninnovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern\nvariants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded\nas on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in\nthis work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without\nassuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native\noff-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for\nadapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and\nactively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths\nabout the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and\nreinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and\nAsymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,\nand offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting\nstrategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with\nextensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled\nalgorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is\navailable at\nhttps://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/rec_gsm8k.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,\nwhere overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation\nhas been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face\npractical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally\nexpensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)\ndeviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),\nwhere models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,\nmight), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this\ndirection, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging\nexpressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a\nlightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero\ncost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of\nLC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs\nunderperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves\ncompetitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a\nfine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability.

A common\npractice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating\na ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction,\nthe end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its\nopaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates\npopularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution\nTracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic\nprobability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference\nclusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,\nPET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling\ntransparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET\nimproves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.\nOn a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at\nranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model\nby 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model\nfrom direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional\npreference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse\npersonalization systems.",

Unlike previous research relying\non archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse\nLLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one\nunidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's\nlatent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination,\nyielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone.\nNotably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall\nrankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities.

Our\nresults across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate\nsimultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:\nproblem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement\nlearning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in\ncurrent reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval\nmechanism as a shortcut, effectively \"hacking\" the reward signal and\nundermining genuine reasoning development.

GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general\nvision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by\nassigning them distinct roles within the framework.

Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro\ndataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\\%$\nand $3.7\\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration\nwithin GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\\%$, representing a $10\n\\times$ improvement.

    "title": "Beyond Magic Words: Sharpness-Aware Prompt Evolving for Robust Large\n  Language Models with TARE",
    "summary": "The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully\nengineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging\nfrom heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,\nprimarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance\nor searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in\npractice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically\npreserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this\nbrittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we\nprovide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,\nsemantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion\nover a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no\ngradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual\nSharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between\nan inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard\nparaphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose\nneighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic\nweights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to\nbalance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose\ndesign for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve\naccuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while\nremaining computationally practical.",

From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs\nare adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs\nfrom the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates\nhow LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on\ndistributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in\nmoral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to\nbridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with\nmoral reasoning objectives.

    "summary": "Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on\ninstruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can\nthese models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We\naddress this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible\nhypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for\nAbductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and\nlabel-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics:\nconsistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability\n(consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and\ndiversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way,\nGEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring\naligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when\nmodels produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate\nonce accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine\nLLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000\ncandidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or\npurely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that\nadjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what\nthe model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating\ndiverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives.\nWithout gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and\nthese gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken\ntogether, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and\nsupplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more\ndiverse and reliable hypotheses.",

    "summary": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to\nautoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high\ninference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic\ncomplexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.\nIntuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict\nattention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.\nSuch approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and\nclearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity\nbehaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in\neach head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising\nsteps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention\nmethods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to\ncapture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in\nearly denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel\nsparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only\nrequires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them\nacross all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising\nstep. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches\nto sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these\nestablish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in\nlong-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD\nachieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\\times$ speedup over\nFlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.",

However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D\nmeshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual\ntask that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry\nsurveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset\ncreation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators.

To overcome these shortcomings and to automate\nthe mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable\nframework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic-\nand visibility-aware objectives.

    "title": "GEM: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and Accurate Cryo-EM\n  Reconstruction",
    "summary": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for\nhigh-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often\nexceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally\nexpensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient\nbut lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space\napproaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur\ncubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel\ncryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that\noperates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of\nmodeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D\nGaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the\ntraining efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians\nthat contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory\nfootprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to\n48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results\nestablish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,\nunifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

    "summary": "Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few\nlabeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by\nincorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic\nfusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that\ncontradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual\ninstances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for\nFew-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts\nconditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly\nintegrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of\nCross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment\n(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support\nimages to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single\nstructured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic\nunderstanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of\nsemantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act\nrespectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level\nclass semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited\nsupport data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,\nand synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the\n3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear\nrelationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent\nmultimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new\nstate-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,\ncross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable\nframework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.\nSimilarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy\nreward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize\nlearning.

    "summary": "Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant\nthreat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires\nincreases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also\nreliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;\nhowever, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its\npredictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To\naddress this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that\njointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance\nshort-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our\nbest-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected\nCalibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both\npredictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of\nthe uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision\nsupport, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting\nlow-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire\ndanger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast\nhorizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with\ntime, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic\nuncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty\ntypes may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary\ninsights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their\njoint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach\nsignificantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger\nforecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.",

While recent works such as\nMarigold~\\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\\citep{he2024lotus} adapt\ndiffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,\ntheir potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains\nunderexplored. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning\nframework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion\npriors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention\nmodules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint\nheatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original\ngenerative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps\nthrough a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the\npre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance\nout-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction\nbranch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics.

    "summary": "RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent\ntransparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of\napplications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting\ntheir practical usability. In this paper, we propose \\textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new\nframework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha\nchannels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that\nencodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the\ntraining of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse\nRGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model\ndemonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and\ntransparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of\nsemi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as\nhair strands.

BraTS\n2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying\ntumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such\ngeneralized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,\nwhich is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing\nlarge volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address\nthese challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that\ndynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial\nnetworks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and\ntheir ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular\non-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly\naugmentation.

Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a\nHybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with\nreprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce\nmulti-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method\ngenerates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric\nconstraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes\ndepth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured\nregions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)\nshow that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR\nand 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.",

    "summary": "Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to\nsynthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing\ntasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,\nattacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in\ninputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study\nintroduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation\nnetwork PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy\ntriggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is\nevaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through\nperceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to\na modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided\nediting. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display\nhigher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the\nassumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional\npixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion\npipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot\nin pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can\nproduce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining\nvisually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation\npipelines.",

    "summary": "Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and\ncross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal\nimage alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and\ncalibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in\nthese areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image\ntranslation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of\nthermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,\nwe propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image\ntranslation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a\nstyle-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight\npublic satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and\nintroduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,\nBosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor\ntypes, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T\nbenchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior\ntranslation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based\nmethods.

Although not straightforward, their recent\napplication to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials\ntowards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing\nmultimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face\nconsiderable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle\nwith missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user\nintentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion\nmodel conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite\nimages by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:\na) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the\nproposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition\nsatellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its\ncontrol signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models\nattribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or\nmissing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both\nqualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control\ninputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of\ngenerations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image\nand temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that\nconditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation\nmodels for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for\nusage in downstream tasks.

    "title": "LOVE-R1: Advancing Long Video Understanding with an Adaptive Zoom-in\n  Mechanism via Multi-Step Reasoning",
    "summary": "Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language\nModels (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and\ndetailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,\nwhich samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,\ninevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in\nsuboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model\nthat can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with\ndensely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are\nneeded, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame\nresolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The\nwhole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the\nreasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k\nhigh-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.\nAs outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we\ndecouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize\nthe internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video\nunderstanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame\nsampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and\nframe resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an\naverage of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have\nenabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and\ntransmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.\nExisting compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow\nand scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which\ndegrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent\ndata-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this\ntrade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering\nquality. We introduce \\textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that\nunifies \\textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with\n\\textbf{GaussPainter} for \\textbf{Ex}treme 3D\\textbf{GS} compression.\n\\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce\nGaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas\n\\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided\nrefinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian\nscenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing\nregions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in\ndegraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a\none-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can\neven achieve over $100\\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model\nto about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image\nquality under challenging conditions.

Despite their success in general domains,\napplying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited\navailability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most\nexisting medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus\nprimarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and\nclinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel\nVietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired\nCT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This\ndataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)\nthe lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which\nhinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;\nand (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the\nVietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report\npairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'\nlearning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets.

    "summary": "A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete\nobjects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet\nleading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text\nconditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis\nintroduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for\nobject-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.\n  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with\ndisentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based\nconditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while\nproviding object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments\ndiffusion models with a register token for background/style and\nslot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and\nachieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,\ncompositional editing, and controllable image generation.\n  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention\n(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal\naggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and\ndynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object\nsegmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as\nobject removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.\n  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to\nobject-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human\nobject-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for\ninteractive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,\nscientific, and practical domains.",

But the photographs\nof emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is\nalternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between\na camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.\nUnlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains\nunderexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and\nperceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and\nintroduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,\nRIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine\ndetails. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key\nbanding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,\nMasked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions\nwithout sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a\nsimulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic\njitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered\nboundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.\nFor evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned\nbanding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics\nand visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently\noutperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe\nflicker-banding.

While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic\nevaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS\ndetection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,\nwe curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and\nclassification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)\nclasses, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for\nobject detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.\nSecond, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five\nYOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge).

Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the\nbest trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger\nmodels (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially\nhigher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms\nthe 7:2:1 split across all models.

    "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance\nacross a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to\nbackdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim\nmodel to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or\nreplaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are\nrelatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such\nfrequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on\nthese targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce\nTokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the\ncompositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed\ntargeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object\nrelationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate\noutputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their\nrelationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap\ninjects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the\ngrammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,\nthe poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,\nmaking it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address\nthis, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly\nemphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and\nbags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nTokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior\nevasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM\narchitectures.",

    "summary": "3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,\nsupporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent\napproaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning\nembedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often\nproduce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct\nuse of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To\naddress this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement\nto generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the\nover-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla\nSAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance\nsemantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that\nintegrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined\nweighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on\nmultiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and\nobject retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing\nmethods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "summary": "Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable\nfew-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion\nmodels, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and\ncostly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still\nrequires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving\ninstability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and\npractical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the\n(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)\nfor vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact\nand principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver\ntrajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to\nthe solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable\ninitialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based\nbaselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing\npost-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.\nEmpirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,\n1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%\nless training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT\nreaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared\nto MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,\nand general framework for training flow map models.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the\nperformance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual\nhallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual\nevidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for\nalignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained\nsemantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a\nnovel framework for MLLM alignment.

This curriculum\nis trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional\nobjective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual\npreferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,\nsymmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual\nhallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and\nversions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to\nbaseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the\nhallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized\nbenchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general\ncapabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general\nvision-language benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world\napplications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards\nindustrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic\nanomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to\naddress general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to\ndataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to\nbridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an\nEncoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for\nindustrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both\nmodels leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality\nfeature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR\nobjective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability\nvia local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We\nevaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and\nmulti-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial\ninspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.\nThe proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in\nmulti-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization\nacross multiple domains of anomaly detection.

As model architectures\nhave matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality\nhas emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and\nensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.\n  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset\nquality and examines how various image quality factors influence model\nperformance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,\nwe identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.\nBuilding on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two\ncommunity-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying\nmechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold\nselection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same\nlevel of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain\ndistortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure\ncritical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess\nthe performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed\nenhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary\nclassification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our\nautomatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under\nsingle perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For\nnear-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score\nfrom 0.4576 to 0.7928.

However, these attributions also hinder the practical\ndeployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.\nServe as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training\nquantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the\ninference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the\ndegradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization\nmethod for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we\nobserve that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not\nhonestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose\ncross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which\nthe quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based\nsmoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and\nleverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible\noverhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.\nWe evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and\nsuccessfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual\nquality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our\ncode is available at\n\\hyperlink{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}.",

    "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant traction in both\ncomputational neuroscience and artificial intelligence for their potential in\nenergy-efficient computing. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs)\nexcel at gradient-based optimization and high accuracy. This contrast has\nconsequently led to a growing subfield of hybrid ANN-SNN research. However,\nexisting hybrid approaches often rely on either a strict separation between ANN\nand SNN components or employ SNN-only encoders followed by ANN classifiers due\nto the constraints of non-differentiability of spike encoding functions,\ncausing prior hybrid architectures to lack deep layer-wise cooperation during\nbackpropagation. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN\nframework that integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within\nconventional ANN pipelines. Central to our method is the use of surrogate\ngradients for a bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end\ndifferentiable training across ANN and SNN layers. This design achieves\ncompetitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while\nretaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of\nspiking computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nimplementation of a surrogate gradient for bit plane coding specifically and\nspike encoder interface in general to be utilized in the context of hybrid\nANN-SNN, successfully leading to a new class of hybrid models that pave new\ndirections for future research.",

    "summary": "We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various\ncountries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on\nspecific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous\nmonitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs\ntypically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road\nusers (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better\nhandle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute\nvehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for\nperception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically\ntraining and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose\nPCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to\nsupport ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic\ndataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design\ninto the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian\ncrossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling\ncurves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into\ncharacteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in\nMoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which\ncontains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show\nthat PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,\neven when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally\nefficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of\nrobotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication\npackage for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and\ndictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:\nhttps://github.com/Claud1234/PCICF",

    "summary": "Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains\nbackground segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such\nvariability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many\nalignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage\nKantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,\nbut rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order\ntemporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a\nself-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused\nPartial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,\nour formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations\nunder a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant\nframes, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional\nvideos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with\ninter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple\nregularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric\n(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves\nup to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,\nwhile producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step\norderings and filter out noise.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution\nimagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained\nland cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -\nparticularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of\nsufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically\nderived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often\nunreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual\ndetail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial\nautocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend\nto co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the\nMask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically\nconsistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,\nsimultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves\nannotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label\nquality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we\nbuild a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,\nreferred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land\ncover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies\nabove 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level\nland cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of\nMCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping.

    "summary": "Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most\nexisting methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction\nand matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information\nfrom RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve\nremarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and\nsemantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an\nimage-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose\nDINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and\ngeometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired\nby advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract\ninformative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features\nat the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and\nglobal semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric\nstructure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed\npositional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both\nimage space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to\nperceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the\nRGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves\nsignificant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal\nregistration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%\nincrease in registration recall.

    "summary": "Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data\ncollection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights\nthat support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images\nfrom corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to\nsubstantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two\ndomains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based\nmodels and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate\ngeographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our\napproach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable\nDiffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance\nthe framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent\npanoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that\nleverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,\nthereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated\nstreet-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging\nCross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image\nsynthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach\noutperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and\nachieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based\nmethods.

We argue that model merging is a natural fit\nfor deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint\nlabels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in\ngenerator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging\npreserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building\nupon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a\ntraining-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real\ncomponent via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each\nspecialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals\nwith layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching\nto prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains\nwhy a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation\ndirection in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor\noff-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,\nR$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines.

    "summary": "Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)\ntransformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we\nidentify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,\nmodality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between\nvision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue\nto the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and\ntext, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where\nrepresentations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.\nUni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,\nwhile maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level\nsemantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at\nboth ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical\ntraining conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to\nstrong baselines.

The generated weights\ncan be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which\nforms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with\nframe indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A\nhypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural\nparameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.\n2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.\nIn contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise\nfeature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a\nunified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis\nvia obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding\nvideo latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR\nweights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all\nNeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and\ninput coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled\nsampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion\nreaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and\ncomparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on\nreal-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings\na smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between\nframes or videos.",

However, many existing\napproaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such\nas text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from\ncoping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image\ninputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.\nMoreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes\nthese systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid\npipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we\npropose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that\nintegrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the\nImprover. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,\nanswer drafting, and iterative improvement.\n  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a\nReflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed\nretrieval.

    "summary": "Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet\ncontinuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation\nmodels. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is\namplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),\nand can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its\ncore design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --\nto lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\\ell_2$ norm), leveraging\nhyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical\nconstraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance\ncollapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet\ngeneration, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,\nachieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54\nand SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger\nbaselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92).

To address these challenges, we propose the Reconfigurable\nContinuum Gaussian Stream, dubbed ReCon-GS, a novel storage-aware framework\nthat enables high fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time\nrendering.

Furthermore, we introduce a storage-aware optimization mechanism that\nflexibly adjusts the density of Anchor Gaussians at different hierarchy levels,\nenabling a controllable trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and memory\nusage. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that,\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods, ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by\napproximately 15% and achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced\nrobustness and stability.

    "title": "Skeleton-based Robust Registration Framework for Corrupted 3D Point\n  Clouds",
    "summary": "Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including\nautonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of\nmultiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.\nHowever, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,\nenvironmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging\ndue to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.\nExisting registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature\nextraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to\nreduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based\nrobust registration framework is presented, which introduces a\ncorruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness\nand accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the\nregistration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the\ncorrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal\nregistration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to\nenforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which\nsignificantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures\nthat the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the\nglobal stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate\nregistration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets\ndemonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration\nmethods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,\nnoise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the\nrobustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential\napproach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.",

    "summary": "The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective\ncompression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,\nvideos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional\nimage codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)\nand ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly\nconsidered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of\ncompression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression\ndistortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying\neffects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.\nMotivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs\n(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different\ndemands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer\nattention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical\nsemantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter\nwith a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of\nlow-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of\ncross-level features.

Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to\nassist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with\npixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation\nfor disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)\nand F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.\nIn medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across\nnine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External\nvalidations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with\ncompetitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size.

The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a\ncurated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),\nmeningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.\nSelected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test\n(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate\nthat the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,\nDiffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow\nachieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-\n0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-\n0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction\nperformance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)\nthan conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and\npatch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method\ngenerates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much\nless time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a\npractical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.",

    "summary": "While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in\nmultimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple\nlanguage queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive\ncomplex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our\nin-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders\nin VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate\ntarget objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex\nqueries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose\nrestructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical\nrelations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight\nis the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,\nattributes, and relations (\"talk in pieces\")-and subsequently aggregating them\ninto hierarchically structured sentence-level representations (\"see in whole\").\nBuilding on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main\ncontributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three\ntiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the\nthree-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss\nfunction, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in\nWhole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically\nstructured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The\nproposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical\nlinguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for\nlanguage-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel\nbenchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of\nlinguistic compositionality.",

Existing generative models, developed to\naddress this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot\naccurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model\nthat utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features\nare high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically\nwell-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs\na GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to\ngenerate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the\nuser to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features\nsuch as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the\nphysicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors\naccording to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,\nmanipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in\ndifferent scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different\norgans (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI.

However, in fine-grained image classification,\nassessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle\ninter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining\ndiscrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active\nfine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the\ndistinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.\nDECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines\ndiscrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The\ndiscrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and\nstructural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature\nfusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify\nthe uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global\ndiversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local\nrepresentativeness.

    "summary": "Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal\ndeformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both\ncoronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant\nprogress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,\nreliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing\nradiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose\nLatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal\nradiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed\nbacks. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal\nalignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal\nmorphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface\ngeometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the\nradiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that\nprogressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding\nradiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based\nFast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from\nRGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model\nmorphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the\nfirst large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and\nlateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen\nproduces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based\nmethods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics.

    "summary": "Point clouds are widely used representations of 3D data, but determining the\nvisibility of points from a given viewpoint remains a challenging problem due\nto their sparse nature and lack of explicit connectivity.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visibility\ndetermination in point clouds by formulating it as a binary classification\ntask. The core of our network consists of a 3D U-Net that extracts\nview-independent point-wise features and a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\nthat predicts point visibility using the extracted features and view direction\nas inputs.

    "summary": "Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects:\npicking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of\nreal-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state\nchange--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and\nvisual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We\npresent SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state\nchange manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common\nstructural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes\nthat can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a\ntransformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially\nprogressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive\nactionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to\ngenerate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance\nvariability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time.\nThese are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for\nfine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control\nfor fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three\nchallenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant\nimprovements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual\ngoal-conditioned baselines.

    "summary": "Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse\nmodalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and\nhuman-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient\nframework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D\nmotion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion\nsequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line\nsampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating\nerror accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic\ngrounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that\nretrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text\ndecompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We\nuse contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning\nsignals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person\ncoordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and\nmulti-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,\nresponsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and\nrhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal\nhuman motion generation.",

    "summary": "The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of\ntransformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in\nrelation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which\nleverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve\nsuperior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,\nat the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing\nequivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local\ncontext windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work\nproposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a\nnovel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our\nmethod enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving\n${O}(N \\log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method\nscales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of\nthe Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token\npermutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We\nbenchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body\nsimulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping\ndataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU\nmemory size, speed, and accuracy.",

While\nconventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific\ndata, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In\nthis paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained\nvision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot\nperformance also on unseen tasks.

Neurons with similar\nresponse properties are spatially clustered, forming smooth maps for acoustic\nfeatures such as frequency in early auditory areas, and modular regions\nselective for music and speech in higher-order cortex. Yet, evaluations for\ncurrent computational models of auditory perception do not measure whether such\ntopographic structure is present in a candidate model. Here, we show that\ncortical topography is not present in the previous best-performing models at\npredicting human auditory fMRI responses. To encourage the emergence of\ntopographic organization, we adapt a cortical wiring-constraint loss originally\ndesigned for visual perception. The new class of topographic auditory models,\nTopoAudio, are trained to classify speech, and environmental sounds from\ncochleagram inputs, with an added constraint that nearby units on a 2D cortical\nsheet develop similar tuning. Despite these additional constraints, TopoAudio\nachieves high accuracy on benchmark tasks comparable to the unconstrained\nnon-topographic baseline models. Further, TopoAudio predicts the fMRI responses\nin the brain as well as standard models, but unlike standard models, TopoAudio\ndevelops smooth, topographic maps for tonotopy and amplitude modulation (common\nproperties of early auditory representation, as well as clustered response\nmodules for music and speech (higher-order selectivity observed in the human\nauditory cortex).

We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a\nfoundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of\nnormalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories\ninto coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary\nmodalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent\ntransitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised\nmasked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across\nmodalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual\nlabels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and\nGeolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as\ntrajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most\npronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual\nreasoning is critical.

We propose a curriculum strategy that\ngradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training,\nstabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second,\nwe introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot\nusing only third-person global state demonstrations.

In contrast, recent RL approaches for\ndiffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),\noptimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow\nmatching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is\nan implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases\nvariance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce\n\\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for\ndiffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a\nlower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage.

    "summary": "The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves\nmodels \"thinking out loud\" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought\n(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.\nFirstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT\ntokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains\nreasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck\nacross reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with\ntoken generation, forcing LLMs to \"think while speaking,\" which causes\npotentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we\nre-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our\napproach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as\na hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional \"thoughts\". Each\nreasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit\nreasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable\nvariables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this\nlatent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we\nfurther propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on\nthree benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous\nreasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to\ntoken-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup\nin inference.

In this work,\nwe propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition\nframework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at\ninference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is\nmodel-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various\ngenerative policies and training paradigms.

Furthermore, we present\ncomprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide\npractical recommendations for deployment.

    "summary": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex\nsequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL\nframework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as\nthe need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.\nTransfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these\nchallenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for\nnew, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from\nscratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage\nthe internal representations learned by the neural network during training.\nSpecifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as\nrefined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the\ninput. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used\nas input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on\nnew tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL\nmodels can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used\nwith linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a\nnovel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce\npositive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging\nthese reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear\nfunction approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation\nstudies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the\nefficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby\nreducing computational overhead.",

    "summary": "As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to\nlearn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and\nimplemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we\nbridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),\ndeveloping an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in\nboth theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening\nobjective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent\nto minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.\nAccordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the\nacceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose\nobjective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow\nstraightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low\ncomplexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative\nmodel trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been\nrelatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm\neliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large\nnumber of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in\nvarious generative tasks.

However,\nfinding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly\nstructured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the\nproperty being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior\nworks have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody\nBayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to\nincorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare\nthem to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody\nproperties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of\na protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the\noptimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of\nstructural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for\nstability, but have equivalent peak performance.

At its core, Fed-Span builds upon\nminimum spanning tree (MST) and minimum spanning forest (MSF) topologies,\nenabling spanning model aggregation and dispatching processes for distributed\nlearning. To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF\ntopologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint\nrepresentations (CCRs), thereby devising graph-theoretical abstractions into an\noptimizable framework for satellite networks.

Our key insight is to\ntreat open-source robotic APIs not only as execution interfaces but also as\nsources of structured supervision: the associated subtask functions - when\nexposed - can serve as modular, semantically meaningful labels. We train a VLM\nto decompose task descriptions into executable subroutines, which are then\ngrounded through a diffusion policy trained to imitate the corresponding robot\nbehavior. To handle the non-Markovian nature of both code execution and certain\nreal-world tasks, such as object swapping, our architecture incorporates a\nmemory mechanism that maintains subtask context across time.

In this work, we propose an alternative perspective: their\nsuccess arises from implicitly learning the data manifold rather than the full\ndistribution. Our claim is based on a novel analysis of scores in the\nsmall-$\\sigma$ regime that reveals a sharp separation of scales: information\nabout the data manifold is $\\Theta(\\sigma^{-2})$ stronger than information\nabout the distribution. We argue that this insight suggests a paradigm shift\nfrom the less practical goal of distributional learning to the more attainable\ntask of geometric learning, which provably tolerates $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ larger\nerrors in score approximation. We illustrate this perspective through three\nconsequences: i) in diffusion models, concentration on data support can be\nachieved with a score error of $o(\\sigma^{-2})$, whereas recovering the\nspecific data distribution requires a much stricter $o(1)$ error; ii) more\nsurprisingly, learning the uniform distribution on the manifold-an especially\nstructured and useful object-is also $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ easier; and iii) in\nBayesian inverse problems, the maximum entropy prior is $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ more\nrobust to score errors than generic priors.

    "summary": "While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of\nresearch for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform\nsequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such\nrepresentations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to\npropose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding\nhow individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in\nwhich PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is\nstill unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of\nsequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root\nvelocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally\nlead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations\ncan be compared with each other.\n  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that\nthe Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a\nnon-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different\nsizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context\nlengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find\nthat PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between\nresidues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most\nstructurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last\nlayer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these\nlayers might lead to improved folding performance.",

    "title": "DRIFT-Net: A Spectral--Coupled Neural Operator for PDEs Learning",
    "summary": "Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve\nwall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.\nIn recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale\nwindowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \\textsc{Poseidon} serving as\na representative example.\n  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral\ncoupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window\nshifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and\ndrift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose\n\\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral\nbranch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing\nglobal, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses\non local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform\ncontrolled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the\nspectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the\nwidth inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The\nfused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image\nbranch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details\nacross scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net\nachieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under\nidentical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the\nrelative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\\%--54\\%, the parameter count decreases\nby about 15\\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies\nand theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of\nthis design. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/DRIFT-Net.",

    "summary": "The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the\nlandscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing\nstructured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating\npopularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which\ndeterminants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in\nthe Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio\nsignal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The\nanalysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of\nBillboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from\ninstrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression\nachieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but\nlower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around\n0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,\nmaintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high\nrecall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting\n(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by\nimproving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall\nfor charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other\nmodels.",

Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates\nthis by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate\nsynthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world\nmodels process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects\nand temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally\ninefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly\ninfluence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we\nintroduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic\nmodulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich\nthe temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived\nfrom a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level\nmotion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic\ncategorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model\n(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics.

Currently, common time series\nforecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches\nprimarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging\nto capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional\nmethods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require\npre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed\nseasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive\nTransformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the\nlimitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining\nEMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing\nseasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale\nadaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four\nparallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,\nenhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A\ndual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately\nprocess seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function\nminimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine\ndatasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets.

    "summary": "Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale, visually homogeneous\ndatasets can be susceptible to shortcut learning, which impairs their\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While generative data augmentation is\na common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data\ncomposition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning\nsignal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of\ninformation fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on\nprincipled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information\nFidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an\noptimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity\nbased on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the\nidentification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where\ntraining stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine,\nMulti-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled\ndata spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures\nsuch as $\\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\\%.\nThese results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis\nalone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.",

Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future\noccurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low\n(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios.

Once\npretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can\nestimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be\nrapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized\napproach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction\nacross common benchmark datasets.\n  Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials will soon be available online",

    "summary": "Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online\ninteractions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has\nemerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both\noffline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often\nnoisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O\nRL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline\npolicies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data\ncorruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still\nunexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed\nbehavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of\nonline exploration.

This paper introduces Q-Net, a\ndata-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that\nperforms robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.\nQ-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)\nvehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated\nfloating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and\nprovides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often\ndiffer in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges.

We\nbuild on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality\nfrom section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.\nUnlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with\ninternal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics.

We demonstrate empirically that this\naddition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop\nreasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,\nwe provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving\nthat identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry.

Appropriate model evaluation should carefully\nconsider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative\nvalue of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which\naffects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and\ncost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility\nand expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision\nthresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,\nand their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are\nclosely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both\ncurves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the\nclassification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and\nnegative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net\nbenefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always\nchoose the same model as optimal at any given threshold.

In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture\ninspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and\nlightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple\ndomains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:\n(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task\ncomplexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,\nclassification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern\nrecognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely\nlow model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.\nFor compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer\nparameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated\nconsistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision\ndataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to\n90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,\nachieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared\nerror than competing models.",

Outside these engagement zones, the interceptor remains invulnerable.\nThe proposed guidance law switches between a repulsive safety maneuver near\nthese zones and a pursuit maneuver outside their influence.

    "summary": "Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing\nand testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity\nand realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit\nscenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to\ngenerate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their\nreliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for\na learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past\ntrajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be\navailable for all agents on the road.Without which, generated scenarios often\nproduce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly\nunder out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address\nthis, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for\ngenerating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories\nconditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories.\nFurthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet\nframe candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant\ntrajectory generation. We also explore various design choices for modeling\ncomplex multi-agent interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod through extensive experiments on the Argoverse2 Dataset and additionally\nevaluate the generalizability of the approach on OOD map variants.

    "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer\nfrom significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their\nreliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its\napplication to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of\nreal-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk\ndomains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state\nchanges that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA\napproaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to\nredundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these\nchallenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that\nreplaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual\nsimulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world\nsimulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and\n(2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides\ncontinuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated\nenvironment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their\ninitial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable\nperformance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task.\nExperiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env\neffectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and\ninefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world\ninteraction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in\nresource-constrained settings.",

    "summary": "{Recognizing human interactions is essential for social robots as it enables\nthem to navigate safely and naturally in shared environments. Conventional\nrobotic systems however often focus on obstacle avoidance, neglecting social\ncues necessary for seamless human-robot interaction. To address this gap, we\npropose a framework to recognize human group interactions for socially aware\nnavigation. Our method utilizes color and depth frames from a monocular RGB-D\ncamera to estimate 3D human keypoints and positions. Principal component\nanalysis (PCA) is then used to determine dominant interaction directions. The\nshoelace formula is finally applied to compute interest points and engagement\nareas. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the validity of\nthe proposed method. The results show that our method is capable of recognizing\ngroup interactions across different scenarios with varying numbers of\nindividuals. It also achieves high-speed performance, processing each frame in\napproximately 4 ms on a single-board computer used in robotic systems. The\nmethod is implemented as a ROS 2 package making it simple to integrate into\nexisting navigation systems.

    "summary": "Aerial robots interacting with objects must perform precise, contact-rich\nmaneuvers under uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of aerial ball\njuggling using a quadrotor equipped with a racket, a task that demands accurate\ntiming, stable control, and continuous adaptation. We propose JuggleRL, the\nfirst reinforcement learning-based system for aerial juggling. It learns\nclosed-loop policies in large-scale simulation using systematic calibration of\nquadrotor and ball dynamics to reduce the sim-to-real gap. The training\nincorporates reward shaping to encourage racket-centered hits and sustained\njuggling, as well as domain randomization over ball position and coefficient of\nrestitution to enhance robustness and transferability. The learned policy\noutputs mid-level commands executed by a low-level controller and is deployed\nzero-shot on real hardware, where an enhanced perception module with a\nlightweight communication protocol reduces delays in high-frequency state\nestimation and ensures real-time control. Experiments show that JuggleRL\nachieves an average of $311$ hits over $10$ consecutive trials in the real\nworld, with a maximum of $462$ hits observed, far exceeding a model-based\nbaseline that reaches at most $14$ hits with an average of $3.1$. Moreover, the\npolicy generalizes to unseen conditions, successfully juggling a lighter $5$ g\nball with an average of $145.9$ hits. This work demonstrates that reinforcement\nlearning can empower aerial robots with robust and stable control in dynamic\ninteraction tasks.",

    "summary": "Echocardiography is a key imaging modality for cardiac assessment but remains\nhighly operator-dependent, and access to trained sonographers is limited in\nunderserved settings. Teleoperated robotic echocardiography has been proposed\nas a solution; however, clinical studies report longer examination times than\nmanual procedures, increasing diagnostic delays and operator workload.\nAutomating non-expert tasks, such as automatically moving the probe to an ideal\nstarting pose, offers a pathway to reduce this burden. Prior vision- and\ndepth-based approaches to estimate an initial probe pose are sensitive to\nlighting, texture, and anatomical variability. We propose a robot-mounted 2D\nLiDAR-based approach that reconstructs the chest surface in 3D and estimates\nthe initial probe pose automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst demonstration of robot-mounted 2D LiDAR used for 3D reconstruction of a\nhuman body surface. Through plane-based extrinsic calibration, the\ntransformation between the LiDAR and robot base frames was estimated with an\noverall root mean square (RMS) residual of 1.8 mm and rotational uncertainty\nbelow 0.2{\\deg}. The chest front surface, reconstructed from two linear LiDAR\nsweeps, was aligned with non-rigid templates to identify an initial probe pose.\nA mannequin-based study assessing reconstruction accuracy showed mean surface\nerrors of 2.78 +/- 0.21 mm. Human trials (N=5) evaluating the proposed approach\nfound probe initial points typically 20-30 mm from the clinically defined\ninitial point, while the variation across repeated trials on the same subject\nwas less than 4 mm.",

Manipulation tasks may require\ncomplex language instructions, such as identifying target objects by their\nrelative positions, to specify human intention. Therefore, we introduce IA-VLA,\na framework that utilizes the extensive language understanding of a large\nvision language model as a pre-processing stage to generate improved context to\naugment the input of a VLA. We evaluate the framework on a set of semantically\ncomplex tasks which have been underexplored in VLA literature, namely tasks\ninvolving visual duplicates, i.e., visually indistinguishable objects. A\ndataset of three types of scenes with duplicate objects is used to compare a\nbaseline VLA against two augmented variants.

    "summary": "Zero-shot object navigation in unknown environments presents significant\nchallenges, mainly due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic guidance\nleads to inefficient exploration, while limited spatial memory resulting from\nenvironmental structure causes entrapment in local regions. To address these\nissues, we propose SSR-ZSON, a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot object\nnavigation method based on the TARE hierarchical exploration framework,\nintegrating a viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and\nsemantic density with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism. The performance\nimprovement of the proposed method is due to two key innovations. First, the\nviewpoint generation strategy prioritizes areas of high semantic density within\ntraversable sub-regions to maximize spatial coverage and minimize invalid\nexploration. Second, coupled with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism, it\nassesses semantic associations to direct navigation toward high-value spaces,\npreventing local entrapment and ensuring efficient exploration. Deployed on\nhybrid Habitat-Gazebo simulations and physical platforms, SSR-ZSON achieves\nreal-time operation and superior performance. On Matterport3D and\nHabitat-Matterport3D datasets, it improves the Success Rate(SR) by 18.5\\% and\n11.2\\%, and the Success weighted by Path Length(SPL) by 0.181 and 0.140,\nrespectively, over state-of-the-art methods.",

Our objective is to use\nthe reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in\nunderstanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these\nfor multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an\nindividual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and\nmust continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework\nthat possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and\nsemantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time\noperation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented\nas a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and\nsequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an\nRNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task.

    "summary": "The emergence of large pre-trained models based on natural language has\nbreathed new life into robotics development. Extensive research has integrated\nlarge models with robots, utilizing the powerful semantic understanding and\ngeneration capabilities of large models to facilitate robot control through\nnatural language instructions gradually. However, we found that robots that\nstrictly adhere to human instructions, especially those containing misleading\ninformation, may encounter errors during task execution, potentially leading to\nsafety hazards. This resembles the concept of counterfactuals in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), which has not yet attracted much attention in\nrobotic research. In an effort to highlight this issue for future studies, this\npaper introduced directive counterfactuals (DCFs) arising from misleading human\ndirectives. We present DynaMIC, a framework for generating robot task flows to\nidentify DCFs and relay feedback to humans proactively. This capability can\nhelp robots be sensitive to potential DCFs within a task, thus enhancing the\nreliability of the execution process. We conducted semantic-level experiments\nand ablation studies, showcasing the effectiveness of this framework.",

However, existing\nmodular approaches heavily rely on the quality of training data and often\nexhibit poor generalization. Vision-Language Model based methods, while\ndemonstrating strong generalization capabilities, tend to perform\nunsatisfactorily when semantic cues are weak. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes SONAR, an aggregated reasoning approach through a cross modal\nparadigm. The proposed method integrates a semantic map based target prediction\nmodule with a Vision-Language Model based value map module, enabling more\nrobust navigation in unknown environments with varying levels of semantic cues,\nand effectively balancing generalization ability with scene adaptability. In\nterms of target localization, we propose a strategy that integrates multi-scale\nsemantic maps with confidence maps, aiming to mitigate false detections of\ntarget objects.

    "summary": "Sampling-based motion planning is a well-established approach in autonomous\ndriving, valued for its modularity and analytical tractability. In complex\nurban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many\ninfeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid\nframework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and\nevaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent\nguides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield\nfeasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by\ndeterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler\nwith a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both\nvariable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent\nrepresentations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation\nenvironment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction\nof up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and\ncollision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable\ndecision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer\nand more responsive navigation under real-world constraints.

    "summary": "Adaptive controllers on quadrotors typically rely on estimation of\ndisturbances to ensure robust trajectory tracking. Estimating disturbances\nacross diverse environmental contexts is challenging due to the inherent\nvariability and uncertainty in the real world. Such estimators require\nextensive fine-tuning for a specific scenario, which makes them inflexible and\nbrittle to changing conditions. Machine-learning approaches, such as training a\nneural network to tune the estimator's parameters, are promising. However,\ncollecting data across all possible environmental contexts is impossible. It is\nalso inefficient as the same estimator parameters could work for \"nearby\"\ncontexts. In this paper, we present a sequential decision making strategy that\ndecides which environmental contexts, using Bayesian Optimization with a\nGaussian Process, to collect data from in order to ensure robust performance\nacross a wide range of contexts. Our method, Contextual NeuroMHE, eliminates\nthe need for exhaustive training across all environments while maintaining\nrobust performance under different conditions. By enabling the neural network\nto adapt its parameters dynamically, our method improves both efficiency and\ngeneralization. Experimental results in various real-world settings demonstrate\nthat our approach outperforms the prior work by 20.3\\% in terms of maximum\nabsolute position error and can capture the variations in the environment with\na few carefully chosen contexts.",

We present\nSafeFlowMatcher, a planning framework that couples FM with control barrier\nfunctions (CBFs) to achieve both real-time efficiency and certified safety.\nSafeFlowMatcher uses a two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) a\nprediction phase integrates the learned FM once (or a few steps) to obtain a\ncandidate path without intervention; (ii) a correction phase refines this path\nwith a vanishing time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program\nthat minimally perturbs the vector field. We prove a barrier certificate for\nthe resulting flow system, establishing forward invariance of a robust safe set\nand finite-time convergence to the safe set. By enforcing safety only on the\nexecuted path (rather than on all intermediate latent paths), SafeFlowMatcher\navoids distributional drift and mitigates local trap problems. Across maze\nnavigation and locomotion benchmarks, SafeFlowMatcher attains faster, smoother,\nand safer paths than diffusion- and FM-based baselines.

A major AV\nproblem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted\nenvironments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and\nprocessing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in\nmany practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the\nplacement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more\ninformative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective\nreconstruction of the environment of interest. This process termed as view\nplanning (VP), can be markedly challenged (i) by noise emerging in the location\nof the cameras and/or in the extracted images, and (ii) by the need to\ngeneralize well in other unknown similar agricultural environments without need\nfor re-optimizing or re-training. To cope with these challenges, the present\nwork presents a novel VP framework that considers a reconstruction\nquality-based optimization formulation that relies on the notion of\n`structure-from-motion' to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sought\nenvironment from the selected 2D images. With no analytic expression of the\noptimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian\noptimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using\nonly a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases.\nNumerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the\nbenefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal\ncamera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and\ngeneralize well on similar unknown environments.",

We validate our approach in a\nmultimodal robotics simulation and a real-world multimodal indoor environment.\nWe compare the performance to several diversity maintenance algorithms from the\nliterature, including Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures.\nOur algorithm achieves high success rates with little to no negative effect on\ncompactness, showing particular robustness to different domains and challenging\ninitial conditions.",

    "title": "Prepare for Warp Speed: Sub-millisecond Visual Place Recognition Using\n  Event Cameras",
    "summary": "Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables systems to identify previously visited\nlocations within a map, a fundamental task for autonomous navigation. Prior\nworks have developed VPR solutions using event cameras, which asynchronously\nmeasure per-pixel brightness changes with microsecond temporal resolution.\nHowever, these approaches rely on dense representations of the inherently\nsparse camera output and require tens to hundreds of milliseconds of event data\nto predict a place. Here, we break this paradigm with Flash, a lightweight VPR\nsystem that predicts places using sub-millisecond slices of event data. Our\nmethod is based on the observation that active pixel locations provide strong\ndiscriminative features for VPR. Flash encodes these active pixel locations\nusing efficient binary frames and computes similarities via fast bitwise\noperations, which are then normalized based on the relative event activity in\nthe query and reference frames. Flash improves Recall@1 for sub-millisecond VPR\nover existing baselines by 11.33x on the indoor QCR-Event-Dataset and 5.92x on\nthe 8 km Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset. Moreover, our approach reduces the\nduration for which the robot must operate without awareness of its position, as\nevidenced by a localization latency metric we term Time to Correct Match (TCM).\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate\nsub-millisecond VPR using event cameras.",

    "title": "Systematic Alias Sampling: an efficient and low-variance way to sample\n  from a discrete distribution",
    "summary": "In this paper we combine the Alias method with the concept of systematic\nsampling, a method commonly used in particle filters for efficient low-variance\nresampling. The proposed method allows very fast sampling from a discrete\ndistribution: drawing k samples is up to an order of magnitude faster than\nbinary search from the cumulative distribution function (cdf) or inversion\nmethods used in many libraries. The produced empirical distribution function is\nevaluated using a modified Cram\\'er-Von Mises goodness-of-fit statistic,\nshowing that the method compares very favourably to multinomial sampling. As\ncontinuous distributions can often be approximated with discrete ones, the\nproposed method can be used as a very general way to efficiently produce random\nsamples for particle filter proposal distributions, e.g. for motion models in\nrobotics.",
