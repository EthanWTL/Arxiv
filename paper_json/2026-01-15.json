    "title": "MatchTIR: Fine-Grained Supervision for Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Bipartite Matching",
    "summary": "Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks.

    "summary": "Deploying large language models in long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions remains challenging because similar entities and facts recur under different latent goals and constraints, causing memory systems to retrieve context-mismatched evidence. We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrieval cue, contextual intent, and retrieves history by matching the current step's intent. Contextual intent provides compact signals that disambiguate repeated mentions and reduce interference: (1) the current latent goal defining a thematic segment, (2) the action type, and (3) the salient entity types anchoring which attributes matter. During inference, STITCH filters and prioritizes memory snippets by intent compatibility, suppressing semantically similar but context-incompatible history.\n  For evaluation, we introduce CAME-Bench, a benchmark for context-aware retrieval in realistic, dynamic, goal-oriented trajectories. Across CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 35.6%, with the largest gains as trajectory length increases. Our analysis shows that intent indexing substantially reduces retrieval noise, supporting intent-aware memory for robust long-horizon reasoning.",

    "summary": "Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.",

    "summary": "Our study examines how generative AI (GenAI) influences performance, creative self-efficacy, and cognitive load in architectural conceptual design tasks. Thirty-six student participants from Architectural Engineering and other disciplines completed a two-phase architectural design task, first independently and then with external tools (GenAI-assisted condition and control condition using an online repository of existing architectural projects). Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI. Cognitive load did not differ significantly between conditions, though prompt usage patterns showed that iterative idea generation and visual feedback prompts were linked to greater reductions in cognitive load. These findings suggest that GenAI effectiveness depends on users' prior expertise and interaction strategies through prompting.",

    "summary": "Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erdös-Renyi and scale-free Barabási-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.",

    "title": "Structure and Diversity Aware Context Bubble Construction for Enterprise Retrieval Augmented Systems",
    "summary": "Large language model (LLM) contexts are typically constructed using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which involves ranking and selecting the top-k passages. The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.",

    "summary": "Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) \"Grokking\" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM \"guesses\" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be \"guessing\" instead of \"reasoning\". Leveraging this \"guessing\" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%. On the scientific side, our analysis provides new insights into how reasoning models \"reason\".",

    "summary": "Sycophancy (overly agreeable or flattering behavior) poses a fundamental challenge for human-AI collaboration, particularly in high-stakes decision-making domains such as health, law, and education. A central difficulty in studying sycophancy in large language models (LLMs) is disentangling sycophantic belief shifts from rational changes in behavior driven by new evidence or user-provided information. Existing approaches either measure descriptive behavior changes or apply normative evaluations that rely on objective ground truth, limiting their applicability to subjective or uncertain tasks. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic framework, grounded in behavioral economics and rational decision theory, that explicitly separates sycophancy from rational belief updating. Within this framework, we achieve three objectives: (i) a descriptive metric that measures sycophancy while controlling for rational responses to evidence; (ii) a normative metric that quantifies how sycophancy leads models astray from Bayesian-consistent belief updating; and (iii) the ability to apply both metrics in settings without ground-truth labels. Applying our framework across multiple LLMs and three uncertainty-driven tasks, we find robust evidence of sycophantic belief shifts and show that their impact on rationality depends on whether models systematically over- or under-update their beliefs. Finally, we demonstrate that a post-hoc calibration method and two fine-tuning strategies (SFT and DPO) substantially reduce Bayesian inconsistency, with particularly strong improvements under explicit sycophancy prompting.",

    "summary": "Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime.

However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.",

    "summary": "Objective: Surface electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive sensing modality widely used in biomechanics, rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and human-machine interfaces. Despite decades of use, achieving robust generalization across subjects, recording systems, and acquisition protocols remains challenging. While foundation models (FMs) are gaining traction for EMG, existing approaches remain limited to single downstream tasks and lack deployability on embedded platforms. This work addresses these limitations. Methods: We present TinyMyo, a lightweight FM based on a Transformer encoder architecture. The model is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner using masked reconstruction on publicly available datasets. With only 3.6M parameters, TinyMyo is designed to support multiple downstream tasks through minimal task-specific head adaptations. Results: We demonstrate generalization across hand gesture classification, hand kinematic regression, speech production and speech recognition, with performance comparable to or surpassing the state of the art (SoA), and model size below 5M parameters. We achieve SoA results compared to previous FM-based works on the NinaPro DB5 (89.4%), UCI-EMG (97.56%), and EPN-612 (96.74%) datasets. We demonstrate the first-time deployment of an EMG FM on an ultra-low power microcontroller (GAP9), with an inference time of 0.785 s, energy of 44.91 mJ and power envelope of 57.18 mW. Conclusion: TinyMyo demonstrates that compact, self-supervised EMG FM can guarantee strong generalization across multiple downstream tasks while remaining compatible with low-power edge devices. Significance: TinyMyo is the first EMG FM for ultra-low power edge devices, enabling scalable and energy-efficient sensing for motor intent decoding, neuromuscular assessment, and biosignal driven human-machine interaction.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models. However, existing methods typically treat visual inputs as deterministic, overlooking the perceptual ambiguity inherent to the visual modality. Consequently, they fail to distinguish whether a model's uncertainty stems from complex reasoning or ambiguous perception, preventing the targeted allocation of exploration or learning signals. To address this gap, we introduce DUPL, a dual-uncertainty guided policy learning approach for multimodal RLVR that quantifies and leverages both perceptual uncertainty (via symmetric KL divergence) and output uncertainty (via policy entropy) to guide policy updates. By establishing an uncertainty-driven feedback loop and employing a dynamic branch prioritization mechanism, DUPL recalibrates the policy advantage to focus learning on states with high perceptual or decisional ambiguity, enabling effective targeted exploration beyond passive data augmentation. Implemented on top of GRPO and evaluated on six multimodal mathematical and general-domain reasoning benchmarks, DUPL improves Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models, achieving accuracy gains of up to 11.2% on visual math tasks and up to 7.1% on general-domain reasoning tasks, while consistently outperforming GRPO. These results demonstrate that dual-uncertainty guided policy learning is an effective and generalizable approach for multimodal RLVR.",

    "title": "On the Failure of Latent State Persistence in Large Language Models",
    "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, whether they can sustain persistent latent states remains under-explored. The capacity to maintain and manipulate unexpressed, internal representations-analogous to human working memory-is a cornerstone of complex reasoning. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the \"Latent State Persistence\" (LSP) gap through three novel experiments. First, we utilize a Number Guessing Game, demonstrating that across independent queries, LLMs fail to allocate probability mass to a singular hidden choice, violating a fundamental probabilistic principle. Second, we employ a Yes-No Game to show that as the number of questions increases, LLMs suffer from \"concept drift,\" leading to inevitable self-contradictions due to the lack of LSP. Finally, inspired by Mathematical Mentalism, we task models with tracking transformations on hidden variables, revealing a failure in variable binding and state evolution when the initial state is not explicitly present in the context. Collectively, these findings suggest that LLMs function as reactive post-hoc solvers rather than proactive planners with LSP. Our work provides a framework for evaluating the fidelity of internal representations and highlights a fundamental architectural divergence between autoregressive transformers and human-like cognition.",

    "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate stigmatized health decisions, their capacity to understand complex psychological phenomena remains inadequately assessed. Can LLMs understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS), examining representation at cognitive (self-judgment), interpersonal (worries about judgment and isolation), and structural (community condemnation and disclosure patterns) levels. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all dimensions. They underestimate cognitive stigma while overestimating interpersonal stigma, introduce demographic biases assigning higher stigma to younger, less educated, and non-White personas, and treat secrecy as universal despite 36% of humans reporting openness. Most critically, models produce internal contradictions: they overestimate isolation yet predict isolated individuals are less secretive, revealing incoherent representations. These patterns show current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent understanding across levels. This work provides empirical evidence that LLMs lack coherent understanding of psychological constructs operating across multiple dimensions. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms.",

    "summary": "Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents that interact with users and with the world. To do so successfully, LLMs must construct representations of the world and form probabilistic beliefs about them. To provide personalized recommendations, for example, the LLM needs to infer a user's preferences from their behavior over multiple interactions. The Bayesian inference framework lays out the optimal way for an agent to update its beliefs as it receives new information. We first show that LLMs fall far short of the standard defined by the Bayesian framework. We then show that by teaching LLMs to mimic the predictions of the normative Bayesian model, we can dramatically improve their ability to update their beliefs; this ability generalizes to new tasks. We conclude that LLMs can effectively learn reasoning skills from examples and generalize those skills to new domains.",

However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \\textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.",

However, evidence in psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory suggests that fairness is also about process and who gets a say in the decisions being made. We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices. This paper argues that procedural legitimacy deserves greater focus as a fairness objective, and provides a framework for putting procedural fairness into practice.",

    "summary": "Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.",

It demonstrates how adversarial evasion attacks can compromise the performance of deep learning models by reducing output confidence or inducing misclassifications. Such attacks are particularly insidious as they can deceive the perception of an algorithm while eluding human perception due to their imperceptibility to the human eye. The proposed attack leverages SHAP values to quantify the significance of individual inputs to the output at the inference stage. A comparison is drawn between the SHAP attack and the well-known Fast Gradient Sign Method. We find evidence that SHAP attacks are more robust in generating misclassifications particularly in gradient hiding scenarios.",

    "summary": "Vision transformers in vision-language models typically use the same amount of compute for every image, regardless of whether it is simple or complex. We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive computation approach that enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both the early-exit and full-depth paths. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.959 with human labelling whilst delivering 4.4x faster complexity prediction. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% faster image encoding while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.",

For Coarse-Grained (CG) category-level retrieval, prominent approaches employ Cross-Modal Hashing (CMH) to prioritise efficiency, albeit at the cost of retrieval performance. Due to differences in methodologies, FG and CG models are rarely compared directly within evaluations in the literature, resulting in a lack of empirical data quantifying the retrieval performance-efficiency tradeoffs between the two. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the \\texttt{FiCo-ITR} library, which standardises evaluation methodologies for both FG and CG models, facilitating direct comparisons. We conduct empirical evaluations of representative models from both subfields, analysing precision, recall, and computational complexity across varying data scales. Our findings offer new insights into the performance-efficiency trade-offs between recent representative FG and CG models, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. These findings provide the foundation necessary to make more informed decisions regarding model selection for specific retrieval tasks and highlight avenues for future research into hybrid systems that leverage the strengths of both FG and CG approaches.",

To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs. Beyond improved accuracy, PG-CBM enhances transparency, enables detection of spurious learning, and provides scientific insights, representing a step toward more trustworthy AI systems in scientific applications.",

Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

    "title": "Small Open Models Achieve Near Parity with Large Models in Low Resource Literary Translation at a Fraction of the Cost",
    "summary": "Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by introducing TinyFabulist Translation Framework (TF2), a unified framework for dataset creation, fine-tuning, and evaluation in English->Romanian literary translation, centered on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine-tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large-scale synthetic parallel datasets (DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for rich, high-quality literary datasets in low-resource languages such as Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high-quality Romanian reference translations from the TF1 pool using a high-performing LLM. We then apply a two-stage fine-tuning process to a 12B-parameter open-weight model: (i) instruction tuning to capture genre-specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus-level BLEU with a five-dimension LLM-based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, and cultural adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results show that our fine-tuned model achieves strong fluency and adequacy, narrowing the gap to top-performing proprietary models under automated and human-anchored evaluation, while being open, accessible, and significantly more cost-effective. Alongside the fine-tuned model and both datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost-efficient translation, cross-lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open models for culturally significant literary content in low-resource settings.",

    "title": "Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks via In-Decoding Safety-Awareness Probing",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

    "summary": "We revisit the efficacy of several practical methods for approximate machine unlearning developed for large-scale deep learning. In addition to complying with data deletion requests, one often-cited potential application for unlearning methods is to remove the effects of poisoned data. We experimentally demonstrate that, while existing unlearning methods have been demonstrated to be effective in a number of settings, they fail to remove the effects of data poisoning across a variety of types of poisoning attacks (indiscriminate, targeted, and a newly-introduced Gaussian poisoning attack) and models (image classifiers and LLMs); even when granted a relatively large compute budget. In order to precisely characterize unlearning efficacy, we introduce new evaluation metrics for unlearning based on data poisoning. Our results suggest that a broader perspective, including a wider variety of evaluations, are required to avoid a false sense of confidence in machine unlearning procedures for deep learning without provable guarantees. Moreover, while unlearning methods show some signs of being useful to efficiently remove poisoned data without having to retrain, our work suggests that these methods are not yet ``ready for prime time,'' and currently provide limited benefit over retraining.",

    "summary": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.",

    "summary": "The practice of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on specialized tasks, yet diagnosing why these models become brittle and fail to generalize remains a critical open problem. To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms. By pinpointing the flawed heuristics responsible for these failures, our work provides a concrete methodology for diagnosing and understanding generalization failures, underscoring that reliable AI requires deep validation of the interplay between architecture, data, and training strategy.",

We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.",

These include Monte Carlo approaches such as the classical algorithms of Karp, Luby, and Madras (1989), as well as methods based on hashing (Soos et al. 2023), and heuristic approximations based on Neural Nets (Abboud, Ceylan, and Lukasiewicz 2020).\n  We develop a new Monte Carlo approach with an adaptive stopping rule and short-circuit formula evaluation.

    "summary": "Edge detection (ED) is a fundamental perceptual process in computer vision, forming the structural basis for high-level reasoning tasks such as segmentation, recognition, and scene understanding. Despite substantial progress achieved by deep neural networks, most ED models attain high numerical accuracy but fail to produce visually sharp and perceptually consistent edges, thereby limiting their reliability in intelligent vision systems. To address this issue, this study introduces the \\textit{Symmetrization Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (SWBCE)} loss, a perception-inspired formulation that extends the conventional WBCE by incorporating prediction-guided symmetry. SWBCE explicitly models the perceptual asymmetry in human edge recognition, wherein edge decisions require stronger evidence than non-edge ones, aligning the optimization process with human perceptual discrimination. The resulting symmetric learning mechanism jointly enhances edge recall and suppresses false positives, achieving a superior balance between quantitative accuracy and perceptual fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and representative ED architectures demonstrate that SWBCE can outperform existing loss functions in both numerical evaluation and visual quality. Particularly with the HED-EES model, the SSIM can be improved by about 15% on BRIND, and in all experiments, training by SWBCE consistently obtains the best perceptual results. Beyond edge detection, the proposed perceptual loss offers a generalizable optimization principle for soft computing and neural learning systems, particularly in scenarios where asymmetric perceptual reasoning plays a critical role.",

    "summary": "Large language models are increasingly used for code generation and debugging, but their outputs can still contain bugs, that originate from training data. Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.",

    "title": "Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation with Vision-Language Reasoning",
    "summary": "As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.",

    "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a crucial role in the field of artificial intelligence, and their security-related testing has been a prominent research focus. By inputting test cases, the behavior of models is examined for anomalies, and coverage metrics are utilized to determine the extent of neurons covered by these test cases. With the widespread application and advancement of DNNs, different types of neural behaviors have garnered attention, leading to the emergence of various coverage metrics for neural networks. However, there is currently a lack of empirical research on these coverage metrics, specifically in analyzing the relationships and patterns between model depth, configuration information, and neural network coverage. This paper aims to investigate the relationships and patterns of four coverage metrics: primary functionality, boundary, hierarchy, and structural coverage. A series of empirical experiments were conducted, selecting LeNet, VGG, and ResNet as different DNN architectures, along with 10 models of varying depths ranging from 5 to 54 layers, to compare and study the relationships between different depths, configuration information, and various neural network coverage metrics. Additionally, an investigation was carried out on the relationships between modified decision/condition coverage and dataset size. Finally, three potential future directions are proposed to further contribute to the security testing of DNN Models.",

We show that measured bias shifts dramatically when prompts mention different places, times, or audiences -- no adversarial prompting required.\n  We introduce Contextual StereoSet, a benchmark that holds stereotype content fixed while systematically varying contextual framing. Testing 13 models across two protocols, we find striking patterns: anchoring to 1990 (vs. 2030) raises stereotype selection in all models tested on this contrast (p<0.05); gossip framing raises it in 5 of 6 full-grid models; out-group observer framing shifts it by up to 13 percentage points. These effects replicate in hiring, lending, and help-seeking vignettes.\n  We propose Context Sensitivity Fingerprints (CSF): a compact profile of per-dimension dispersion and paired contrasts with bootstrap CIs and FDR correction. Two evaluation tracks support different use cases -- a 360-context diagnostic grid for deep analysis and a budgeted protocol covering 4,229 items for production screening.\n  The implication is methodological: bias scores from fixed-condition tests may not generalize.This is not a claim about ground-truth bias rates; it is a stress test of evaluation robustness. CSF forces evaluators to ask, \"Under what conditions does bias appear?\" rather than \"Is this model biased?\" We release our benchmark, code, and results.",

    "summary": "Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for advanced trajectory aggregation. This work enables parallel TTS for latent reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM) trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection. Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in continuous spaces. Code and checkpoints released at https://github.com/ModalityDance/LatentTTS",

    "summary": "Although the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) dominate industrial tabular applications, upgrading legacy models in high-concurrency production environments still faces prohibitive retraining costs and systemic risks. To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being \"non-intrusive\". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on \"hard regions\" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted for tasks like drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In these settings, users may need to share private information (e.g., contact details, health records). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such information, prior work introduced real-life, scenario-based benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) and found that LLMs can leak private information in complex scenarios. However, these evaluations relied on proxy LLMs to judge the helpfulness and privacy-preservation quality of LLM responses, rather than directly measuring users' perceptions. To understand how users perceive the helpfulness and privacy-preservation quality of LLM responses to privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study ($n=94$) using 90 PrivacyLens scenarios. We found that users had low agreement with each other when evaluating identical LLM responses. In contrast, five proxy LLMs reached high agreement, yet each proxy LLM had low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that proxy LLMs cannot accurately estimate users' wide range of perceptions of utility and privacy in privacy-sensitive scenarios. We discuss the need for more user-centered studies to measure LLMs' ability to help users while preserving privacy, and for improving alignment between LLMs and users in estimating perceived privacy and utility.",

    "summary": "The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph, extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.",

Ensuring that AI agents perform only authorized actions and handle inputs appropriately is essential for maintaining system integrity and preventing misuse. In this study, we introduce the AgentGuardian, a novel security framework that governs and protects AI agent operations by enforcing context-aware access-control policies. During a controlled staging phase, the framework monitors execution traces to learn legitimate agent behaviors and input patterns. From this phase, it derives adaptive policies that regulate tool calls made by the agent, guided by both real-time input context and the control flow dependencies of multi-step agent actions. Evaluation across two real-world AI agent applications demonstrates that AgentGuardian effectively detects malicious or misleading inputs while preserving normal agent functionality. Moreover, its control-flow-based governance mechanism mitigates hallucination-driven errors and other orchestration-level malfunctions.",

    "summary": "Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical, yet traditional fine-tuning methods are computationally expensive and inflexible. While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.",

    "summary": "Privacy policies help inform people about organisations' personal data processing practices, covering different aspects such as data collection, data storage, and sharing of personal data with third parties. Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.",

However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.",

Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems. Across four benchmarks, LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5 percent on both backbones while adding approximately 2 milliseconds of probe overhead.",

    "title": "Bootstrap Off-policy with World Model",
    "summary": "Online planning has proven effective in reinforcement learning (RL) for improving sample efficiency and final performance. However, using planning for environment interaction inevitably introduces a divergence between the collected data and the policy's actual behaviors, degrading both model learning and policy improvement. To address this, we propose BOOM (Bootstrap Off-policy with WOrld Model), a framework that tightly integrates planning and off-policy learning through a bootstrap loop: the policy initializes the planner, and the planner refines actions to bootstrap the policy through behavior alignment. This loop is supported by a jointly learned world model, which enables the planner to simulate future trajectories and provides value targets to facilitate policy improvement. The core of BOOM is a likelihood-free alignment loss that bootstraps the policy using the planner's non-parametric action distribution, combined with a soft value-weighted mechanism that prioritizes high-return behaviors and mitigates variability in the planner's action quality within the replay buffer. Experiments on the high-dimensional DeepMind Control Suite and Humanoid-Bench show that BOOM achieves state-of-the-art results in both training stability and final performance.

    "title": "Handling Missing Modalities in Multimodal Survival Prediction for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer",
    "summary": "Accurate survival prediction in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) requires the integration of heterogeneous clinical, radiological, and histopathological information. While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.",

    "summary": "Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.",

However, in daily practice, this assumption is often broken, i.e. the distribution of the test data changes over time, which hinders the application of conventional ML models. One domain where the distribution shift naturally occurs is text classification, since people always find new topics to discuss. To this end, we survey research articles studying open-set text classification and related tasks. We divide the methods in this area based on the constraints that define the kind of distribution shift and the corresponding problem formulation, i.e. learning with the Universum, zero-shot learning, and open-set learning. We next discuss the predominant mitigation approaches for each problem setup. We further identify several future work directions, aiming to push the boundaries beyond the state of the art. Finally, we explain how continual learning can solve many of the issues caused by the shifting class distribution.

SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. We evaluate SuS on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of our approach. SuS achieves 17.4% improvement in Pass@1 and 26.4% improvement in Pass@5 compared to baseline methods, while maintaining higher strategy diversity throughout training.",

    "summary": "Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.",

Theoretical analysis shows that BSZO improves the convergence rate by a factor of $k/γ$ compared to standard ZO methods. Experiments on RoBERTa, Mistral, and OPT models show that BSZO outperforms the baselines across various tasks, achieving up to 6.67\\% absolute average improvement on OPT-13B while remaining robust under fp16/bf16 precision and keeping memory usage close to inference-only baselines (1.00$\\times$--1.08$\\times$ of MeZO).",

These include respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and the neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms. We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the \"population bias\" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.",

While this architecture enables powerful customization, skills execute with implicit trust and minimal vetting, creating a significant yet uncharacterized attack surface. We conduct the first large-scale empirical security analysis of this emerging ecosystem, collecting 42,447 skills from two major marketplaces and systematically analyzing 31,132 using SkillScan, a multi-stage detection framework integrating static analysis with LLM-based semantic classification. Our findings reveal pervasive security risks: 26.1% of skills contain at least one vulnerability, spanning 14 distinct patterns across four categories: prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. Data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%) are most prevalent, while 5.2% of skills exhibit high-severity patterns strongly suggesting malicious intent. We find that skills bundling executable scripts are 2.12x more likely to contain vulnerabilities than instruction-only skills (OR=2.12, p<0.001). Our contributions include: (1) a grounded vulnerability taxonomy derived from 8,126 vulnerable skills, (2) a validated detection methodology achieving 86.7% precision and 82.5% recall, and (3) an open dataset and detection toolkit to support future research.

    "summary": "Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate's gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO's potential to offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.",

    "summary": "Pre-trained language models (LMs) have, over the last few years, grown substantially in both societal adoption and training costs. This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs.",

    "title": "Advancing Safe Mechanical Ventilation Using Offline RL With Hybrid Actions and Clinically Aligned Rewards",
    "summary": "Invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life-sustaining therapy commonly used in the intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with severe and acute conditions. These patients frequently rely on MV for breathing. Given the high risk of death in such cases, optimal MV settings can reduce mortality, minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, shorten ICU stays, and ease the strain on healthcare resources. However, optimizing MV settings remains a complex and error-prone process due to patient-specific variability. While Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows promise for optimizing MV settings, current methods struggle with the hybrid (continuous and discrete) nature of MV settings. Discretizing continuous settings leads to exponential growth in the action space, which limits the number of optimizable settings. Converting the predictions back to continuous can cause a distribution shift, compromising safety and performance. To address this challenge, in the IntelliLung project, we are developing an AI-based approach where we constrain the action space and employ factored action critics. This approach allows us to scale to six optimizable settings compared to 2-3 in previous studies. We adapt SOTA offline RL algorithms to operate directly on hybrid action spaces, avoiding the pitfalls of discretization. We also introduce a clinically grounded reward function based on ventilator-free days and physiological targets. Using multiobjective optimization for reward selection, we show that this leads to a more equitable consideration of all clinically relevant objectives. Notably, we develop a system in close collaboration with healthcare professionals that is aligned with real-world clinical objectives and designed with future deployment in mind.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities across a wide range of complex tasks and are increasingly deployed at scale, placing significant demands on inference efficiency. Prior work typically decomposes inference into prefill and decode stages, with the decode stage dominating total latency. To reduce time and memory complexity in the decode stage, a line of work introduces sparse-attention algorithms. In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding. Our early-stopping algorithm reduces token consumption by up to 90% with a marginal accuracy degradation of less than 2% across reasoning-intensive benchmarks.",

We introduce CARENLI, a compartmentalised agentic framework that routes each premise-statement pair to a reasoning family and then applies a specialised solver with explicit verification and targeted refinement. We evaluate on an expanded CTNLI benchmark of 200 instances spanning four reasoning families: Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction. Across four contemporary backbone models, CARENLI improves mean accuracy from about 23% with direct prompting to about 57%, a gain of roughly 34 points, with the largest benefits on structurally demanding reasoning types. These results support compartmentalisation plus verification as a practical route to more reliable and auditable clinical inference.",

    "summary": "While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has advanced LLM reasoning, applying it to long-context scenarios is hindered by sparsity of outcome rewards. This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded \"lucky guesses,\" leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance. Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to SOTA baselines.",

    "summary": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.",

    "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown great promise in advancing robotics by combining embodied reasoning with robot control. A common approach involves training on embodied reasoning tasks related to robot control using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, SFT datasets are often heuristically constructed and not explicitly optimized for improving robot control. Furthermore, SFT often leads to issues such as catastrophic forgetting and reduced generalization performance. To address these limitations, we introduce Robot-R1, a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to enhance embodied reasoning specifically for robot control. Robot-R1 learns to predict the next keypoint state required for task completion, conditioned on the current scene image and environment metadata derived from expert demonstrations. Inspired by the DeepSeek-R1 learning approach, Robot-R1 samples reasoning-based responses and reinforces those that lead to more accurate predictions. To rigorously evaluate Robot-R1, we also introduce a new benchmark that demands the diverse embodied reasoning capabilities for the task. Our experiments show that models trained with Robot-R1 outperform SFT methods on embodied reasoning tasks. Despite having only 7B parameters, Robot-R1 even surpasses GPT-4o on reasoning tasks related to low-level action control, such as spatial and movement reasoning.",

    "summary": "Inspired by human categorization, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognizing low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current visual question answering (VQA) studies consider multiple object properties, such as size, they typically blend perception and reasoning and lack representativeness in terms of reasoning and image categories, making it unclear whether and how vision-language models (VLMs) abstract and reason over depicted objects. To this end, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework comprising images of three representative types, three reasoning levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions, informed by prior work on common sense. We develop a procedure to instantiate this framework in two VQA object reasoning benchmarks: OPTICS-CNT, comprising 360 images paired with 1,080 multi-level, count-based questions, and OPTICS-CMP, with 2.1k comparison questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings reveal significant limitations relative to humans, with the best-performing model achieving below 40% counting and 70% comparison accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with photographic images, counterfactual reasoning, physical and functional properties, and higher counts. We make the OPTICS benchmark data and code available to support future work on scalable benchmarking methods, generalized annotation guidelines, and advanced reasoning VLMs.",

This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.",

    "summary": "We consider a single large language model (LLM) server that serves a heterogeneous stream of queries belonging to $N$ distinct task types. Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.",

Impact findings show that AI-assisted coding enhances developer productivity but also introduces challenges, such as verification overhead and over-reliance. Design studies show that effective interfaces surface context, provide explanations and transparency of suggestion, and support user control. Quality studies document risks in correctness, maintainability, and security. For future research, priorities include productivity studies, design of assistance, and audit of AI-generated code.

    "summary": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) often faces challenges from substantial memory and computational costs. Quantization offers a solution, yet performance degradation in the sub-1-bit regime remains particularly difficult. This paper introduces LittleBit, a novel method for extreme LLM compression. It targets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\\times$ memory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW. LittleBit establishes a new, viable size-performance trade-off--unlocking a potential 11.6$\\times$ speedup over FP16 at the kernel level--and makes powerful LLMs practical for resource-constrained environments.

While current multimodal models typically process diverse modality representations with identical parameters, disregarding their inherent representational differences, we introduce specialized routing pathways that direct tokens to modality-appropriate experts based on input type. MAMoE simultaneously enhances modality-specific learning and cross-modal understanding through two complementary components: modality-specific expert groups that capture domain-specific patterns and shared experts that facilitate information transfer between modalities. Building on this architecture, we develop an efficient transformation pipeline that adapts the pretrained MoE language model through strategic post-training on ASR and TTS datasets, followed by fine-tuning with a carefully curated speech-text instruction dataset. A key feature of this pipeline is that it relies exclusively on fully accessible, open-source datasets to achieve strong performance and data efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks show that MoST consistently outperforms existing models of comparable parameter counts. Our ablation studies confirm that the modality-specific routing mechanism and shared experts design significantly contribute to performance gains across all tested domains. To our knowledge, MoST represents the first fully open-source speech-text LLM built on a Mixture of Experts architecture. \\footnote{We release MoST model, training code, inference code, and training data at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/MoST",

Despite recent enhancements, LoRA still suffers from a fundamental limitation: overfitting when the bottleneck is widened. It performs best at ranks 32-64, yet its accuracy stagnates or declines at higher ranks, still falling short of full fine-tuning (FFT) performance. We identify the root cause as LoRA's structural bottleneck, which introduces gradient entanglement to the unrelated input channels and distorts gradient propagation. To address this, we introduce a novel structure, Granular Low-Rank Adaptation (GraLoRA) that partitions weight matrices into sub-blocks, each with its own low-rank adapter. With negligible computational or storage cost, GraLoRA overcomes LoRA's limitations, effectively increases the representational capacity, and more closely approximates FFT behavior. Experiments on code generation and commonsense reasoning benchmarks show that GraLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA and other baselines, achieving up to +8.5% absolute gain in Pass@1 on HumanEval+. These improvements hold across model sizes and rank settings, making GraLoRA a scalable and robust solution for PEFT.

Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes. Notably, smaller TranslateGemma models often achieve performance comparable to larger baseline models, offering improved efficiency.

    "summary": "Low-dose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging reduces patient radiation exposure but suffers from increased noise that degrades image quality and diagnostic reliability. Although diffusion models have demonstrated strong denoising capability, their stochastic nature makes it challenging to enforce anatomically consistent structures, particularly in low signal-to-noise regimes and volumetric whole-body imaging. We propose Wavelet-Conditioned ControlNet (WCC-Net), a fully 3D diffusion-based framework that introduces explicit frequency-domain structural priors via wavelet representations to guide volumetric PET denoising. By injecting wavelet-based structural guidance into a frozen pretrained diffusion backbone through a lightweight control branch, WCC-Net decouples anatomical structure from noise while preserving generative expressiveness and 3D structural continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WCC-Net consistently outperforms CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based baselines. On the internal 1/20-dose test set, WCC-Net improves PSNR by +1.21 dB and SSIM by +0.008 over a strong diffusion baseline, while reducing structural distortion (GMSD) and intensity error (NMAE). Moreover, WCC-Net generalizes robustly to unseen dose levels (1/50 and 1/4), achieving superior quantitative performance and improved volumetric anatomical consistency.",

    "title": "Untangling Input Language from Reasoning Language: A Diagnostic Framework for Cross-Lingual Moral Alignment in LLMs",
    "summary": "When LLMs judge moral dilemmas, do they reach different conclusions in different languages, and if so, why? Two factors could drive such differences: the language of the dilemma itself, or the language in which the model reasons. Standard evaluation conflates these by testing only matched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with English reasoning). We introduce a methodology that separately manipulates each factor, covering also mismatched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with Chinese reasoning), enabling decomposition of their contributions. To study \\emph{what} changes, we propose an approach to interpret the moral judgments in terms of Moral Foundations Theory. As a side result, we identify evidence for splitting the Authority dimension into a family-related and an institutional dimension. Applying this methodology to English-Chinese moral judgment with 13 LLMs, we demonstrate its diagnostic power: (1) the framework isolates reasoning-language effects as contributing twice the variance of input-language effects; (2) it detects context-dependency in nearly half of models that standard evaluation misses; and (3) a diagnostic taxonomy translates these patterns into deployment guidance. We release our code and datasets at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CrossCulturalMoralJudgement.",

Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily assess models' proficiency in reasoning-based geometry-where solutions are derived using algebraic methods-NoReGeo focuses on evaluating whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly. Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset. Our findings highlight a significant gap in current LLMs' ability to natively grasp geometric concepts, providing a foundation for future research toward models with true geometric cognition.",

    "summary": "Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) aims to improve generalization by minimizing a worst-case perturbed loss over a small neighborhood of model parameters. However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue. We prove X-SAM's convergence and superior generalization, with extensive experimental evaluations confirming both theoretical and practical advantages.",

This work aims to continuously forecast the timing of future events by analyzing multi-sensor data streams. A key characteristic of real-world data streams is their dynamic nature, where the underlying patterns evolve over time. To address this, we present TimeCast, a dynamic prediction framework designed to adapt to these changes and provide accurate, real-time predictions of future event time. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Dynamic: it identifies the distinct time-evolving patterns (i.e., stages) and learns individual models for each, enabling us to make adaptive predictions based on pattern shifts. (b) Practical: it finds meaningful stages that capture time-varying interdependencies between multiple sensors and improve prediction performance; (c) Scalable: our algorithm scales linearly with the input size and enables online model updates on data streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that TimeCast provides higher prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while finding dynamic changes in data streams with a great reduction in computational time.",

    "summary": "Multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving are vulnerable to cascading failures, where a single incorrect step leads to complete solution breakdown. Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency. All methods generalize effectively across math reasoning tasks, demonstrating that step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning.",

In this report, we empirically investigate whether Looped Transformers (LTs)--architectures that increase computational depth by iterating shared layers--can bridge this gap by utilizing their iterative nature as a form of introspection. Our experiments reveal that while increasing loop iterations narrows the gap, it is partly driven by a degradation of their internal knowledge carried by representations. Moreover, another empirical analysis suggests that current LTs' ability to perceive representations does not improve across loops; it is only present in the final loop. These results suggest that while LTs offer a promising direction for scaling computational depth, they have yet to achieve the introspection required to truly link representation space and natural language.",

In this work, we address these limitations by introducing the first class of distributionally robust CAs and their associated learning algorithms. The latter cast robust causal abstraction learning as a constrained min-max optimization problem with Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We provide theoretical results, for both empirical and Gaussian environments, leading to principled selection of the level of robustness via the radius of these sets. Furthermore, we present empirical evidence across different problems and CA learning methods, demonstrating our framework's robustness not only to environmental shifts but also to structural model and intervention mapping misspecification.",

However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability. Code is available at https://github.com/ml-jku/LaM-SLidE .",

In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.",

Across the two AI-assisted tasks, psychological ownership dropped relative to unassisted writing (about 0.85-1.0 points on a 7-point scale), even as cognitive load decreased (about 0.9 points) and quality ratings stayed broadly similar overall. Persona coaching did not prevent the ownership decline. Style personalization partially restored ownership (about +0.43) and increased AI incorporation in text (+5 percentage points).

    "summary": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance gains of up to 15--20\\% over existing self-supervised approaches.

Classical ML typically relies on stochastic, sample-separable objectives that favor first-order and adaptive gradient methods. In contrast, SciML often involves physics-informed or operator-constrained formulations in which differential operators induce global coupling, stiffness, and strong anisotropy in the loss landscape. As a result, optimization behavior in SciML is governed by the spectral properties of the underlying physical models rather than by data statistics, frequently limiting the effectiveness of standard stochastic methods and motivating deterministic or curvature-aware approaches. This document provides a unified introduction to optimization methods in ML and SciML, emphasizing how problem structure shapes algorithmic choices. We review first- and second-order optimization techniques in both deterministic and stochastic settings, discuss their adaptation to physics-constrained and data-driven SciML models, and illustrate practical strategies through tutorial examples, while highlighting open research directions at the interface of scientific computing and scientific machine learning.",

To implement MPG efficiently, we design Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining high-quality generation.

    "summary": "The prevalence of recommendation systems also brings privacy concerns to both the users and the sellers, as centralized platforms collect as much data as possible from them. To keep the data private, we propose PADER: a Paillier-based secure decentralized social recommendation system. In this system, the users and the sellers are nodes in a decentralized network. The training and inference of the recommendation model are carried out securely in a decentralized manner, without the involvement of a centralized platform. To this end, we apply the Paillier cryptosystem to the SoReg (Social Regularization) model, which exploits both user's ratings and social relations. We view the SoReg model as a two-party secure polynomial evaluation problem and observe that the simple bipartite computation may result in poor efficiency. To improve efficiency, we design secure addition and multiplication protocols to support secure computation on any arithmetic circuit, along with an optimal data packing scheme that is suitable for the polynomial computations of real values. Experiment results show that our method only takes about one second to iterate through one user with hundreds of ratings, and training with ~500K ratings for one epoch only takes <3 hours, which shows that the method is practical in real applications.

    "title": "Judge Q: Trainable Queries for Optimized Information Retention in KV Cache Eviction",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.",

However, existing benchmarks either focus on a single language or conflate retrieval with generation, leaving open the question of whether current embedding models can encode persona-instruction compatibility without relying on response synthesis. We present a unified benchmark spanning 12 Indian languages and four evaluation tasks: monolingual and cross-lingual persona-to-instruction retrieval, reverse retrieval from instruction to persona, and binary compatibility classification. Eight multilingual embedding models are evaluated in a frozen-encoder setting with a thin logistic regression head for classification. E5-Large-Instruct achieves the highest Recall@1 of 27.4\\% on monolingual retrieval and 20.7\\% on cross-lingual transfer, while BGE-M3 leads reverse retrieval at 32.1\\% Recall@1.

However, most existing RAG strategies treat retrieved passages in a flat and unstructured way, which prevents the model from capturing structural cues and constrains its ability to synthesize knowledge from dispersed evidence across documents. To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence. These structures are jointly integrated into a planning blueprint that conditions the generation. Experiments on question answering and long-document summarization benchmarks show the efficacy of our approach. Disco-RAG achieves state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks without fine-tuning. These findings underscore the important role of discourse structure in advancing RAG systems.",

    "summary": "Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.",

Existing approaches typically consider a single querying (interaction) format when seeking human feedback and do not leverage multiple modes of user interaction with a robot. We examine how to learn a penalty function associated with unsafe behaviors using multiple forms of human feedback, by optimizing both the query state and feedback format. Our proposed adaptive feedback selection is an iterative, two-phase approach which first selects critical states for querying, and then uses information gain to select a feedback format for querying across the sampled critical states. The feedback format selection also accounts for the cost and probability of receiving feedback in a certain format. Our experiments in simulation demonstrate the sample efficiency of our approach in learning to avoid undesirable behaviors. The results of our user study with a physical robot highlight the practicality and effectiveness of adaptive feedback selection in seeking informative, user-aligned feedback that accelerate learning.

Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors. Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.",

    "summary": "Automated analysis of needle electromyography (nEMG) signals is emerging as a tool to support the detection of neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), yet the signals' high and heterogeneous sampling rates pose substantial computational challenges for feature-based machine-learning models, particularly for near real-time analysis. Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.",

This approach enables deterministic scoring and scalable evaluation without human annotation or reference models, and contamination resistance through regenerable corpora. Our evaluation of 33 models using over 21 billion tokens reveals that context length claims frequently exceed usable capacity, with significant degradation beyond 32K tokens; cross-document aggregation proves substantially harder than single-document extraction; and grounding ability and hallucination resistance are distinct capabilities - models excelling at finding facts that exist may still fabricate facts that do not.

To further ensure reasoning logic and accuracy, we introduce a test-time scaling mechanism with a preference-optimized judge model that scores reasoning steps and selects the best trajectory.

    "summary": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict anonymous users' next interaction based on their interaction sessions. In the practical recommendation scenario, low-exposure items constitute the majority of interactions, creating a long-tail distribution that severely compromises recommendation diversity. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by promoting tail items but incur accuracy degradation, exhibiting a \"see-saw\" effect between long-tail and accuracy performance. We attribute such conflict to session-irrelevant noise within the tail items, which existing long-tail approaches fail to identify and constrain effectively. To resolve this fundamental conflict, we propose \\textbf{HID} (\\textbf{H}ybrid \\textbf{I}ntent-based \\textbf{D}ual Constraint Framework), a plug-and-play framework that transforms the conventional \"see-saw\" into \"win-win\" through introducing the hybrid intent-based dual constraints for both long-tail and accuracy. Two key innovations are incorporated in this framework: (i) \\textit{Hybrid Intent Learning}, where we reformulate the intent extraction strategies by employing attribute-aware spectral clustering to reconstruct the item-to-intent mapping. Furthermore, discrimination of session-irrelevant noise is achieved through the assignment of the target and noise intents to each session. (ii) \\textit{Intent Constraint Loss}, which incorporates two novel constraint paradigms regarding the \\textit{diversity} and \\textit{accuracy} to regulate the representation learning process of both items and sessions. These two objectives are unified into a single training loss through rigorous theoretical derivation. Extensive experiments across multiple SBR models and datasets demonstrate that HID can enhance both long-tail performance and recommendation accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in long-tail recommender systems.",

    "title": "Alignment Pretraining: AI Discourse Causes Self-Fulfilling (Mis)alignment",
    "summary": "Pretraining corpora contain extensive discourse about AI systems, yet the causal influence of this discourse on downstream alignment remains poorly understood. If prevailing descriptions of AI behaviour are predominantly negative, LLMs may internalise corresponding behavioural priors, giving rise to self-fulfilling misalignment. This paper provides the first controlled study of this hypothesis by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse. We find that discussion of AI contributes to misalignment. Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment leads to a notable increase in misaligned behaviour. Conversely, upsampling documents about aligned behaviour reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9%. We consider this evidence of self-fulfilling alignment. These effects are dampened, but persist through post-training. Our findings establish the study of how pretraining data shapes alignment priors, or alignment pretraining, as a complement to post-training. We recommend practitioners pretrain for alignment as well as capabilities. Our models and datasets are available at alignmentpretraining.ai",

    "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for Protein Representation Learning (PRL), as residue interaction networks can be naturally represented as graphs. Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.",

Current quantization methods compress storage but fail to reduce bandwidth as attention calculation requires dequantizing keys from INT4/INT8 to FP16 before use. We observe that attention scoring is mathematically equivalent to the inner product similarity search and we can apply some compression techniques from vector databases to compress KV-cache better. We propose LOOKAT, which applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, to transformer architecture by decomposing key vectors into subspaces, learning codebooks and computing attention tables via lookup tables. This transforms attention from memory-bound to compute-bound. LOOKAT achieves 64 $\\times$ compression at 95.7\\% output fidelity and 32 $\\times$ compression at 95.0\\% fidelity when tested on GPT-2. LOOKAT requires no architecture changes or training while maintaining rank correlation $ρ> 0.95$.

MHub.ai packages models from peer-reviewed publications into standardized containers that support direct processing of DICOM and other formats, provide a unified application interface, and embed structured metadata. Each model is accompanied by publicly available reference data that can be used to confirm model operation. MHub.ai includes an initial set of state-of-the-art segmentation, prediction, and feature extraction models for different modalities. The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis. By simplifying model use, MHub.ai enables side-by-side benchmarking with identical execution commands and standardized outputs, and lowers the barrier to clinical translation.",

    "summary": "Rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved major advances in reasoning, planning, and function-calling capabilities. Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets.

Nonetheless, existing noise mitigation methods often encounter limitations in practical applications due to their task-specific design, model dependency, and significant computational overhead. In this work, we exploit the properties of high-dimensional orthogonality to identify a robust and effective boundary in cone space for separating clean and noisy samples. Building on this, we propose One-Step Anti-noise (OSA), a model-agnostic noisy label mitigation paradigm that employs an estimator model and a scoring function to assess the noise level of input pairs through just one-step inference. We empirically validate the superiority of OSA, demonstrating its enhanced training robustness, improved task transferability, streamlined deployment, and reduced computational overhead across diverse benchmarks, models, and tasks.

    "summary": "The effectiveness of contrastive learning methods has been widely recognized in the field of graph learning, especially in contexts where graph data often lack labels or are difficult to label. However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model training. Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL). Specifically, SNGCL employs a superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filter as a step in processing the data to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, respectively, which are thus passed into the target and online networks of the siamese network, and finally employs an improved triple recombination loss function to bring the intra-class distance closer and the inter-class distance farther. We have compared SNGCL with state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, and the experimental results show that SNGCL is strongly competitive in most tasks.",

    "summary": "Long-sequence decision-making, which is usually addressed through reinforcement learning (RL), is a critical component for optimizing strategic operations in dynamic environments, such as real-time bidding in computational advertising. The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. It extends the AIGB paradigm and points to promising directions for future exploration in online bidding.",

We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framework, enabling provenance-aware replay and continuous data quality monitoring.

To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework.

    "summary": "Fine-tuning is an essential and pervasive functionality for applying large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.\n  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.",

Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

Recent efforts such as InfiBench and StackEval rely on Stack Overflow questions and remain limited to single-turn interactions, manually curated data, and isolated snippets rather than full project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first benchmark for evaluating multi-turn, project-grounded programming assistance at scale. CAB automatically constructs datasets from GitHub issues tagged as questions, using an LLM-driven pipeline that filters noise, extracts runnable contexts, builds executable containers, and verifies environment correctness. This enables continuous, automated expansion across diverse repositories without manual intervention. Using CAB, we create a testbed of 3,286 real-world issues across 214 repositories, spanning seven languages. Evaluating state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap: while models achieve 70-83% accuracy on Stack Overflow-style questions, they solve only 7.22-16.49% of CAB issues from post-training-cutoff repositories. These results highlight a fundamental challenge: current LLMs struggle to provide assistance in realistic, project-specific contexts despite strong performance on traditional Q&A benchmarks. CAB provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing research in multi-turn, codebase-grounded programming agents.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning and prediction across different domains. Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that \"more context leads to better reasoning\". Our study highlights fundamental limitations of today's LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.",

    "summary": "We study abstract visual composition, in which identity is primarily determined by the spatial configuration and relations among a small set of geometric primitives (e.g., parts, symmetry, topology). They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.",

    "summary": "Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \\textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.",

    "summary": "Functional dependencies (FDs) are basic constraints in relational databases and are used for many data management tasks. Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods.",

In this work, we identify a critical Perception Gap in distillation: student models frequently mimic a teacher's textual output while attending to fundamentally divergent visual regions, effectively relying on language priors rather than grounded perception. To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks and enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.",

This paper systematically reviews the current development and key technologies of RPLAs, delineating the technological evolution from early rule-based template paradigms, through the language style imitation stage, to the cognitive simulation stage centered on personality modeling and memory mechanisms. It summarizes the critical technical pathways supporting high-quality role-playing, including psychological scale-driven character modeling, memory-augmented prompting mechanisms, and motivation-situation-based behavioral decision control. At the data level, the paper further analyzes the methods and challenges of constructing role-specific corpora, focusing on data sources, copyright constraints, and structured annotation processes. In terms of evaluation, it collates multi-dimensional assessment frameworks and benchmark datasets covering role knowledge, personality fidelity, value alignment, and interactive hallucination, while commenting on the advantages and disadvantages of methods such as human evaluation, reward models, and LLM-based scoring. Finally, the paper outlines future development directions of role-playing agents, including personality evolution modeling, multi-agent collaborative narrative, multimodal immersive interaction, and integration with cognitive neuroscience, aiming to provide a systematic perspective and methodological insights for subsequent research.",

To address this issue, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL) framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing historical EEG samples. ProNECL summarizes subject-specific discriminative representations into class-level prototypes and incrementally aligns new subject representations with a global prototype memory through prototype-based feature regulariza-tion and cross-subject alignment. Experiments on the BCI Com-petition IV 2a and 2b datasets demonstrate that ProNECL effec-tively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks.",

    "summary": "Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs KL regularized reward maximization with reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\\%$ relative improvement over the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are challenging to deploy for domain-specific tasks due to their massive scale. While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS. Experiments across diverse domain tasks--including QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages--show that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, allowing the student model to match or even exceed the performance of its fine-tuned teacher.",

The paradigm employed a four-class Korean-language task, including three imagined speech targets selected according to the participant's daily communicative needs and a resting-state condition, and was evaluated in a single individual with chronic anomic aphasia. Within this framework, we introduce a lightweight diffusion-based neural decoding model explicitly optimized for real-time inference, achieved through architectural simplifications such as dimensionality reduction, temporal kernel optimization, group normalization with regularization, and dual early-stopping criteria. In real-time evaluation, the proposed system achieved 65\\% top-1 and 70\\% top-2 accuracy, with the Water class reaching 80\\% top-1 and 100\\% top-2 accuracy.

We introduce the Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG), a deterministic, evidence backed architectural map that represents buildable components, aggregators, runners, tests, external packages, and package managers, connected by explicit dependency and coverage edges that trace back to concrete build and test definitions. We also present SPADE, a deterministic extractor that constructs RIG from build and test artifacts (currently with an automatic CMake plugin based on the CMake File API and CTest metadata), and exposes RIG as an LLM friendly JSON view that agents can treat as the authoritative description of repository structure.\n  We evaluate three commercial agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) on eight repositories spanning low to high build oriented complexity, including the real world MetaFFI project. Each agent answers thirty structured questions per repository with and without RIG in context, and we measure accuracy, wall clock completion time, and efficiency (seconds per correct answer). Across repositories and agents, providing RIG improves mean accuracy by 12.2\\% and reduces completion time by 53.9\\%, yielding a mean 57.8\\% reduction in seconds per correct answer.

    "summary": "Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical success but suffers from the \"moving target\" problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually. Functional critics, or policy-conditioned value functions, have been proposed to address this issue by including a representation of the policy as input. While the concept of generalizing value functions across policy space is appealing, previous efforts have struggled to remain competitive against state-of-the-art AC algorithms that do not utilize functional critics. In this work, we revisit functional critics within the off-policy AC framework and identify two aspects that render them a necessity rather than a luxury. First, in off-policy AC, critic learning contends with both the \"deadly triad\" instability and the \"moving target\" issue, while actor learning faces the challenge of estimating the exact off-policy policy gradient. This complex interplay makes theoretical convergence extremely difficult for practical algorithms. We demonstrate that a functional critic is essential for addressing this challenge and establish the first convergence proof for an off-policy target-based AC algorithm under linear function approximation. Second, we identify a crucial link between functional critic modeling and efficient exploration. Specifically, we show that approximating posterior sampling for exploration in model-free settings is infeasible without functional critics. Practically, we propose a tailored neural network architecture and a minimal AC algorithm that relies solely on these insights. In experiments on the DeepMind Control Suite, this implementation achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods.",

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \\textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs.

    "summary": "Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has emerged as a highly effective technique to improve model generalization, but its underlying principles are not fully understood. We investigate m-sharpness, where SAM performance improves monotonically as the micro-batch size for computing perturbations decreases, a phenomenon critical for distributed training yet lacking rigorous explanation. We leverage an extended Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) framework and analyze stochastic gradient noise (SGN) to characterize the dynamics of SAM variants, including n-SAM and m-SAM. Our analysis reveals that stochastic perturbations induce an implicit variance-based sharpness regularization whose strength increases as m decreases. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reweighted SAM (RW-SAM), which employs sharpness-weighted sampling to mimic the generalization benefits of m-SAM while remaining parallelizable. Comprehensive experiments validate our theory and method.",

    "summary": "Interactive humanoid video generation aims to synthesize lifelike visual agents that can engage with humans through continuous and responsive video. Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.",

    "summary": "As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.",

Forecasting Accurately predicting stock prices has always been a focal point for various researchers. However, existing statistical approaches for time-series prediction often fail to effectively forecast the probability range of future stock prices. Hence, to solve this problem, the Neural Prophet with a Deep Neural Network (NP-DNN) is proposed to predict stock market prices. The preprocessing technique used in this research is Z-score normalization, which normalizes stock price data by removing scale differences, making patterns easier to detect. Missing value imputation fills gaps in historical data, enhancing the models use of complete information for more accurate predictions. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) learns complex nonlinear relationships among stock market prices and extracts hidden patterns from the input data, thereby creating meaningful feature representations for better prediction accuracy. The proposed NP-DNN model achieved an accuracy of 99.21% compared with other approaches using the Fused Large Language Model.

    "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal learning have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

However, existing methods tend to rely on static modality integration schemes and simple fusion strategies. As a result, they fail to fully exploit modality-specific representations. In this paper, we propose Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality. Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations. We also confirmed that level-wise integration is a key factor in achieving robust predictive performance across various clinical conditions.",

    "summary": "Social Determinants of Health (SDOH), also known as Health-Related Social Needs (HSRN), play a significant role in patient health outcomes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) introduced a subset of ICD-10 codes called Z-codes to recognize and measure SDOH. However, Z-codes are infrequently coded in a patient's Electronic Health Record (EHR), and instead, in many cases, need to be inferred from clinical notes. Previous research has shown that large language models (LLMs) show promise on extracting unstructured data from EHRs, but it can be difficult to identify a single model that performs best on varied coding tasks. Further, clinical notes contain protected health information posing a challenge for the use of closed-source language models from commercial vendors. The identification of open-source LLMs that can be run within health organizations and exhibit high performance on SDOH tasks is an important issue to solve. Here, we introduce an intelligent routing system for SDOH coding that uses a language model router to direct medical record data to open-source LLMs that demonstrate optimal performance on specific SDOH codes. This intelligent routing system exhibits state of the art performance of 96.4% accuracy averaged across 13 codes, including homelessness and food insecurity, outperforming closed models such as GPT-4o. We leveraged a publicly-available, deidentified dataset of medical record notes to run the router, but we also introduce a synthetic data generation and validation paradigm to increase the scale of training data without needing privacy-protected medical records. Together, we demonstrate an architecture for intelligent routing of inputs to task-optimal language models to achieve high performance across a set of medical coding sub-tasks.",

Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods. We also propose difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore the effect of difficulty in the generation process. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It also highlights the broader potential of difficulty for diverse downstream tasks.",

With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella \"Glass Slipper\" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs \"in the wild\" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become essential for eliciting complex reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.",

    "summary": "One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.",

To better understand the sources of this verbalized confidence, we introduce TracVC (\\textbf{Trac}ing \\textbf{V}erbalized \\textbf{C}onfidence), a method that builds on information retrieval and influence estimation to trace generated confidence expressions back to the training data. We evaluate TracVC on OLMo and Llama models in a question answering setting, proposing a new metric, content groundness, which measures the extent to which an LLM grounds its confidence in content-related training examples (relevant to the question and answer) versus in generic examples of confidence verbalization. Our analysis reveals that OLMo2-13B is frequently influenced by confidence-related data that is lexically unrelated to the query, suggesting that it may mimic superficial linguistic expressions of certainty rather than rely on genuine content grounding. These findings point to a fundamental limitation in current training regimes: LLMs may learn how to sound confident without learning when confidence is justified. Our analysis provides a foundation for improving LLMs' trustworthiness in expressing more reliable confidence.",

We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@$k$ across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@$k$ curve (AUC@$K$) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial ``jailbreak'' attacks designed to bypass safety guardrails. Current safety alignment methods depend heavily on static external red teaming, utilizing fixed defense prompts or pre-collected adversarial datasets. This leads to a rigid defense that overfits known patterns and fails to generalize to novel, sophisticated threats. To address this critical limitation, we propose empowering the model to be its own red teamer, capable of achieving autonomous and evolving adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce Safety Self- Play (SSP), a system that utilizes a single LLM to act concurrently as both the Attacker (generating jailbreaks) and the Defender (refusing harmful requests) within a unified Reinforcement Learning (RL) loop, dynamically evolving attack strategies to uncover vulnerabilities while simultaneously strengthening defense mechanisms. To ensure the Defender effectively addresses critical safety issues during the self-play, we introduce an advanced Reflective Experience Replay Mechanism, which uses an experience pool accumulated throughout the process. The mechanism employs a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy to focus on failure cases with low rewards, helping the model learn from past hard mistakes while balancing exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SSP approach autonomously evolves robust defense capabilities, significantly outperforming baselines trained on static adversarial datasets and establishing a new benchmark for proactive safety alignment.",

    "summary": "Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation. However, their ability to create complex visualizations for scaled and structured data remains largely unevaluated and underdeveloped. To address this gap, we introduce PlotCraft, a new benchmark featuring 1k challenging visualization tasks that cover a wide range of topics, such as finance, scientific research, and sociology. The benchmark is structured around seven high-level visualization tasks and encompasses 48 distinct chart types. Crucially, it is the first to systematically evaluate both single-turn generation and multi-turn refinement across a diverse spectrum of task complexities. Our comprehensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs on PlotCraft reveals obvious performance deficiencies in handling sophisticated visualization tasks. To bridge this performance gap, we develope SynthVis-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of complex visualization code synthesized via a collaborative agent framework. Building upon this dataset, we develope PlotCraftor, a novel code generation model that achieves strong capabilities in complex data visualization with a remarkably small size. Across VisEval, PandasPlotBench, and our proposed PlotCraft, PlotCraftor shows performance comparable to that of leading proprietary approaches. Especially, on hard task, Our model achieves over 50% performance improvement. We will release the benchmark, dataset, and code at https://github.com/Speakn0w/PlotCraft-Benchmark.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an increasingly important tool in research and society at large. While LLMs are regularly used all over the world by experts and lay-people alike, they are predominantly developed with English-speaking users in mind, performing well in English and other wide-spread languages while less-resourced languages such as Luxembourgish are seen as a lower priority. This lack of attention is also reflected in the sparsity of available evaluation tools and datasets. In this study, we investigate the viability of language proficiency exams as such evaluation tools for the Luxembourgish language. We find that large models such as Claude and DeepSeek-R1 typically achieve high scores, while smaller models show weak performances. We also find that the performances in such language exams can be used to predict performances in other NLP tasks in Luxembourgish.",

These metrics are rather straightforward to use and compare in monolingual setups, but rest on a number of assumptions in multilingual setups. One such assumption is that comparing the perplexity of CLMs on parallel sentences is indicative of their quality since the information content (here understood as the semantic meaning) is the same. However, the metrics are inherently measuring information content in the information-theoretic sense. We make this and other such assumptions explicit and discuss their implications. We perform experiments with six metrics on two multi-parallel corpora both with mono- and multilingual models. Ultimately, we find that current metrics are not universally comparable. We look at the form-meaning debate to provide some explanation for this.",

We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including stereotypes, fairness, toxicity, and sentiment. We employ both probability- and generated text-based metrics across 13 benchmarks and evaluate models that differ in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic categories and subgroups, and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.",

    "summary": "Selective knowledge erasure from LLMs is critical for GDPR compliance and model safety, yet current unlearning methods conflate behavioral suppression with true knowledge removal, allowing latent capabilities to persist beneath surface-level refusals. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (<3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence. Our comprehensive dual-metric evaluation protocol, combining surface-level leakage with latent trace persistence, operationalizes the obfuscation - erasure distinction and enables the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior across model families and scales.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in human-centric applications, yet they often fail to provide substantive emotional support. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been utilized to enhance empathy of LLMs, existing reward models typically evaluate empathy from a single perspective, overlooking the inherently bidirectional interaction nature of empathy between the supporter and seeker as defined by Empathy Cycle theory. To address this limitation, we propose Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling (PERM). PERM operationalizes empathy evaluation through a bidirectional decomposition: 1) Supporter perspective, assessing internal resonation and communicative expression; 2) Seeker perspective, evaluating emotional reception. Additionally, it incorporates a bystander perspective to monitor overall interaction quality. Extensive experiments on a widely-used emotional intelligence benchmark and an industrial daily conversation dataset demonstrate that PERM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\\%. Furthermore, a blinded user study reveals a 70\\% preference for our approach, highlighting its efficacy in generating more empathetic responses.

    "summary": "Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.",

Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.",

To address these, we introduce DR-Arena, a fully automated evaluation framework that pushes DR agents to their capability limits through dynamic investigation. DR-Arena constructs real-time Information Trees from fresh web trends to ensure the evaluation rubric is synchronized with the live world state, and employs an automated Examiner to generate structured tasks testing two orthogonal capabilities: Deep reasoning and Wide coverage. DR-Arena further adopts Adaptive Evolvement Loop, a state-machine controller that dynamically escalates task complexity based on real-time performance, demanding deeper deduction or wider aggregation until a decisive capability boundary emerges. Experiments with six advanced DR agents demonstrate that DR-Arena achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.94 with the LMSYS Search Arena leaderboard. This represents the state-of-the-art alignment with human preferences without any manual efforts, validating DR-Arena as a reliable alternative for costly human adjudication.",

    "summary": "Surgical planning integrates visual perception, long-horizon reasoning, and procedural knowledge, yet it remains unclear whether current evaluation protocols reliably assess vision-language models (VLMs) in safety-critical settings. Motivated by a goal-oriented view of surgical planning, we define planning correctness via phase-goal satisfiability, where plan validity is determined by expert-defined surgical rules. Based on this definition, we introduce a multicentric meta-evaluation benchmark with valid procedural variations and invalid plans containing order and content errors. Using this benchmark, we show that sequence similarity metrics systematically misjudge planning quality, penalizing valid plans while failing to identify invalid ones. We therefore adopt a rule-based goal-satisfiability metric as a high-precision meta-evaluation reference to assess Video-LLMs under progressively constrained settings, revealing failures due to perception errors and under-constrained reasoning. Structural knowledge consistently improves performance, whereas semantic guidance alone is unreliable and benefits larger models only when combined with structural constraints.",

However, for morphologically rich and computationally under-resourced languages such as Romanian, there is still no openly documented, end-to-end pipeline that unifies tokenizer design, preprocessing, pretraining, compression, evaluation, and large-scale synthetic data generation in a reproducible framework. Building on TF1, a three-million-story English fable dataset, and TF2, which extends TF1 through high-quality Romanian translations, we introduce TF3-RO, a Romanian-centric language modeling pipeline spanning tokenizer training, from-scratch model development, and Romanian-native dataset generation. TF3-RO constructs Romanian-specific BPE and Unigram tokenizers from a linguistically informed corpus to mitigate token inflation induced by Romanian morphology. Using long-sequence packed training, we pretrain a 51.65M-parameter LLaMA-style Transformer entirely from scratch. The model is subsequently optimized through quantization, structured pruning, and logit-based knowledge distillation, yielding a compact 26.45M-parameter student model with tied embeddings and strong deployment characteristics. Using this distilled model, TF3-RO generates three million Romanian-native synthetic fables via a controlled combinatorial prompting framework. Across all stages, the pipeline integrates a comprehensive evaluation suite combining intrinsic metrics, Romanian agreement probes, entity coherence, rule-based grammar checking, and LLM-based assessment. TF3-RO provides a reproducible and linguistically grounded framework for training compact Romanian language models and producing large-scale synthetic narrative corpora.",

In India, the issue is particularly important: despite Hindi being the third most spoken language globally (over 600 million speakers), its numerous dialects remain underrepresented. The situation is similar for Odia, which has around 45 million speakers. While some datasets exist which contain standard Hindi and Odia languages, their regional dialects have almost no web presence. We introduce INDIC-DIALECT, a human-curated parallel corpus of 13k sentence pairs spanning 11 dialects and 2 languages: Hindi and Odia. Using this corpus, we construct a multi-task benchmark with three tasks: dialect classification, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and machine translation (MT). Our experiments show that LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 perform poorly on the classification task. While fine-tuned transformer based models pretrained on Indian languages substantially improve performance e.g., improving F1 from 19.6\\% to 89.8\\% on dialect classification. For dialect to language translation, we find that hybrid AI model achieves highest BLEU score of 61.32 compared to the baseline score of 23.36. Interestingly, due to complexity in generating dialect sentences, we observe that for language to dialect translation the ``rule-based followed by AI\" approach achieves best BLEU score of 48.44 compared to the baseline score of 27.59. INDIC-DIALECT thus is a new benchmark for dialect-aware Indic NLP, and we plan to release it as open source to support further work on low-resource Indian dialects.",

    "summary": "Large language models can represent a variety of personas but typically default to a helpful Assistant identity cultivated during post-training. We investigate the structure of the space of model personas by extracting activation directions corresponding to diverse character archetypes. Across several different models, we find that the leading component of this persona space is an \"Assistant Axis,\" which captures the extent to which a model is operating in its default Assistant mode. Steering towards the Assistant direction reinforces helpful and harmless behavior; steering away increases the model's tendency to identify as other entities. Moreover, steering away with more extreme values often induces a mystical, theatrical speaking style. We find this axis is also present in pre-trained models, where it primarily promotes helpful human archetypes like consultants and coaches and inhibits spiritual ones. Measuring deviations along the Assistant Axis predicts \"persona drift,\" a phenomenon where models slip into exhibiting harmful or bizarre behaviors that are uncharacteristic of their typical persona. We find that persona drift is often driven by conversations demanding meta-reflection on the model's processes or featuring emotionally vulnerable users. We show that restricting activations to a fixed region along the Assistant Axis can stabilize model behavior in these scenarios -- and also in the face of adversarial persona-based jailbreaks. Our results suggest that post-training steers models toward a particular region of persona space but only loosely tethers them to it, motivating work on training and steering strategies that more deeply anchor models to a coherent persona.",

Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on τ - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm.

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have increasingly supported omni-modal processing across text, vision, and speech. However, existing evaluation frameworks for such models suffer from critical limitations, including modality shortcuts and biased reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we propose OMHBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate omni-modal multi-hop reasoning. It consists of 6,144 questions with balanced reasoning paths that are jointly grounded across all three modalities. Extensive evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art models reveals that (1) a large performance gap exists between proprietary and open-source MLLMs and (2) even proprietary models exhibit high sensitivity to reasoning path variations, resulting in asymmetric omni-modal grounding. Notably, models struggle when processing the speech modality, underscoring the need for balanced, multi-hop evaluation of omni-modal intelligence.",

    "summary": "Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.",

In this paper, we propose a re-ranking model based on a new generation of late cross-attention architecture, that decomposes both resumes and project briefs to efficiently handle long-context inputs with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate historical data biases, we use a generative large language model (LLM) as a teacher, generating fine-grained, semantically grounded supervision. This signal is distilled into our student model via an enriched distillation loss function. The resulting model produces skill-fit scores that enable consistent and interpretable person-job matching.

In this paper, we introduce SENse-based Symmetric Interlingual Alignment (SENSIA), which adapts a Backpack language model from one language to another by explicitly aligning sense-level mixtures and contextual representations on parallel data, while jointly training a target-language language modeling loss to preserve fluency. Across benchmarks on four typologically diverse languages, SENSIA generally outperforms comparable multilingual alignment methods and achieves competitive accuracy against monolingual from-scratch baselines while using 2-4x less target-language data. Analyses of learned sense geometry indicate that local sense topology and global structure relative to English are largely preserved, and ablations show that the method is robust in terms of design and scale.",

Current alignment techniques often act as superficial guardrails, leaving the intrinsic moral representations of LLMs largely untouched. In this paper, we bridge this gap by leveraging Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to map and manipulate the fine-grained moral landscape of LLMs. Through cross-lingual linear probing, we validate the shared nature of moral representations in middle layers and uncover a shared yet different moral subspace between English and Chinese. Building upon this, we extract steerable Moral Vectors and successfully validate their efficacy at both internal and behavioral levels. Leveraging the high generalizability of morality, we propose Adaptive Moral Fusion (AMF), a dynamic inference-time intervention that synergizes probe detection with vector injection to tackle the safety-helpfulness trade-off. Empirical results confirm that our approach acts as a targeted intrinsic defense, effectively reducing incorrect refusals on benign queries while minimizing jailbreak success rates compared to standard baselines.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved multi-step reasoning. Most approaches rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Previous studies have shown that LLMs often generate logically inconsistent reasoning steps even when their final answers are correct. These inconsistencies reduce the reliability of step-level reasoning. We propose GeoSteer, a manifold-based framework that improves the quality of intermediate reasoning. The method consists of: (1) constructing a CoT dataset with segment-level scores, (2) training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model and a quality estimation model to learn a low-dimensional manifold of high-quality CoT trajectories, and (3) steering hidden states of target LLMs toward higher-quality regions in the latent space. This update in a latent space behaves like a natural-gradient adjustment in the original hidden-state space. It ensures geometrically coherent steering. We evaluate GeoSteer on the GSM8k dataset using the Qwen3 series. We measure via answer accuracy and overall reasoning performance. GeoSteer improved the exact match accuracy by up to 2.6 points. It also enhanced the pairwise win rate by 5.3 points. These results indicate that GeoSteer provides an effective and controllable mechanism for improving the quality of intermediate reasoning in LLMs.",

In this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case. Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular matrices.\n  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.",

    "summary": "The INTERSPEECH 2025 Challenge on Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Models (MLC-SLM) promotes multilingual conversational ASR with large language models (LLMs). Our previous SHNU-mASR system adopted a competitive parallel-speech-encoder architecture that integrated Whisper and mHuBERT with an LLM. However, it faced two challenges: simple feature concatenation may not fully exploit complementary information, and the performance gap between LLM-based ASR and end-to-end(E2E) encoder-decoder ASR remained unexplored. In this work, we present an enhanced LLM-based ASR framework that combines fine-tuned Whisper and mHuBERT encoders with an LLM to enrich speech representations. We first evaluate E2E Whisper models with LoRA and full fine-tuning on the MLC-SLM ASR task, and then propose cross-attention-based fusion mechanisms for the parallel-speech-encoder. On the official evaluation set of the MLC-SLM Challenge, our system achieves a CER/WER of 10.69%, ranking on par with the top-ranked Track 1 systems, even though it uses only 1,500 hours of baseline training data compared with their large-scale training sets. Nonetheless, we find that our final LLM-based ASR still does not match the performance of a fine-tuned E2E Whisper model, providing valuable empirical guidance for future Speech-LLM design.

A key limitation, however, is their inability to systematically learn from these mistakes, forcing them to repeat identical errors in similar contexts. Unlike prior training-free methods that primarily store raw instance-level experience or focus on retrieving successful trajectories, we propose Mistake Notebook Learning (MNL), a novel memory framework that enables agents to self-curate generalizable guidance from batch-clustered failures. This mechanism allows agents to distill shared error patterns into structured ``mistake notes,'' updating an external memory only when batch performance improves to ensure stability. To further amplify adaptability, we integrate MNL with test-time scaling, leveraging aggregated failure patterns to actively steer the search process away from known pitfalls. Experiments on mathematical reasoning, Text-to-SQL, and interactive agent benchmarks show that MNL achieves competitive performance compared to existing memory mechanisms and in-context methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. These findings position structured mistake abstraction as a critical lever for robust agent evolution, enabling continuous improvement without the cost of parameter updates.",

    "summary": "This study investigates the applicability of HealthBench, a large-scale, rubric-based medical benchmark, to the Japanese context. Although robust evaluation frameworks are essential for the safe development of medical LLMs, resources in Japanese are scarce and often consist of translated multiple-choice questions. Our research addresses this issue in two ways. First, we establish a performance baseline by applying a machine-translated version of HealthBench's 5,000 scenarios to evaluate two models: a high-performing multilingual model (GPT-4.1) and a Japanese-native open-source model (LLM-jp-3.1). Secondly, we use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach to systematically classify the benchmark's scenarios and rubric criteria. This allows us to identify 'contextual gaps' where the content is misaligned with Japan's clinical guidelines, healthcare systems or cultural norms. Our findings reveal a modest performance drop in GPT-4.1 due to rubric mismatches, as well as a significant failure in the Japanese-native model, which lacked the required clinical completeness. Furthermore, our classification shows that, despite most scenarios being applicable, a significant proportion of the rubric criteria require localisation. This work underscores the limitations of direct benchmark translation and highlights the urgent need for a context-aware, localised adaptation, a \"J-HealthBench\", to ensure the reliable and safe evaluation of medical LLMs in Japan.",

We describe the data construction process, annotation strategy, and training methodology, and evaluate the model on proprietary human-annotated datasets. Experimental results show consistent improvements over traditional pipeline-based approaches, indicating that domain-specialized conversational language models provide a scalable and privacy-aware solution for real-time assistance and post-call analytics in enterprise contact centers.",

    "summary": "Most interpretability work focuses on layer- or neuron-level mechanisms in Transformers, leaving expert-level behavior in MoE LLMs underexplored. Motivated by functional specialization in the human brain, we analyze expert activation by distinguishing domain and driver experts. In this work, we study expert activation in MoE models across three public domains and address two key questions: (1) which experts are activated, and whether certain expert types exhibit consistent activation patterns; and (2) how tokens are associated with and trigger the activation of specific experts. To answer these questions, we introduce entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to assess whether an expert is strongly favored for a particular domain, and how strongly expert activation contributes causally to the model's output, thus identify domain and driver experts, respectively. Furthermore, we explore how individual tokens are associated with the activation of specific experts. Our analysis reveals that (1) Among the activated experts, some show clear domain preferences, while others exert strong causal influence on model performance, underscoring their decisive roles. (2) tokens occurring earlier in a sentence are more likely to trigger the driver experts, and (3) adjusting the weights of domain and driver experts leads to significant performance gains across all three models and domains. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms of MoE models and enhance their interpretability.",

    "summary": "While LLM-based agents can interact with environments via invoking external tools, their expanded capabilities also amplify security risks. Monitoring step-level tool invocation behaviors in real time and proactively intervening before unsafe execution is critical for agent deployment, yet remains under-explored. In this work, we first construct TS-Bench, a novel benchmark for step-level tool invocation safety detection in LLM agents. We then develop a guardrail model, TS-Guard, using multi-task reinforcement learning. The model proactively detects unsafe tool invocation actions before execution by reasoning over the interaction history. It assesses request harmfulness and action-attack correlations, producing interpretable and generalizable safety judgments and feedback. Furthermore, we introduce TS-Flow, a guardrail-feedback-driven reasoning framework for LLM agents, which reduces harmful tool invocations of ReAct-style agents by 65 percent on average and improves benign task completion by approximately 10 percent under prompt injection attacks.",

    "summary": "Generative language models are usually pretrained on large text corpus via predicting the next token (i.e., sub-word/word/phrase) given the previous ones. Recent works have demonstrated the impressive performance of large generative language models on downstream tasks. However, existing generative language models generally neglect an inherent challenge in text corpus during training, i.e., the imbalance between frequent tokens and infrequent ones. It can lead a language model to be dominated by common and easy-to-learn tokens, thereby overlooking the infrequent and difficult-to-learn ones. To alleviate that, we propose a MiLe Loss function for mitigating the bias of learning difficulties with tokens. During training, it can dynamically assess the learning difficulty of a to-be-learned token, according to the information entropy of the corresponding predicted probability distribution over the vocabulary. Then it scales the training loss adaptively, trying to lead the model to focus more on the difficult-to-learn tokens. On the Pile dataset, we train generative language models at different scales of 468M, 1.2B, and 6.7B parameters. Experiments reveal that models incorporating the proposed MiLe Loss can gain consistent performance improvement on downstream benchmarks.",

Yet, distilling these models often demands large-scale data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), motivating the pursuit of data-efficient training methods. To address this, we propose a skill-centric distillation framework that efficiently transfers reasoning ability to weaker models with two components: (1) Skill-based data selection, which prioritizes examples targeting the student model's weaker skills, and (2) Skill-aware fine-tuning, which encourages explicit skill decomposition during problem solving. With only 1,000 training examples selected from a 100K teacher-generated corpus, our method surpasses random SFT baselines by +1.6% on Qwen3-4B and +1.4% on Qwen3-8B across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Further analysis confirms that these gains concentrate on skills emphasized during training, highlighting the effectiveness of skill-centric training for efficient reasoning distillation.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health-related settings, yet they struggle to sustain realistic, goal-directed dialogue over extended interactions. While LLMs generate fluent responses, they optimize locally for the next turn rather than maintaining a coherent model of therapeutic progress, leading to brittleness and long-horizon drift. We introduce CALM-IT, a framework for generating and evaluating long-form Motivational Interviewing (MI) dialogues that explicitly models dual-actor conversational dynamics. CALM-IT represents therapist-client interaction as a bidirectional state-space process, in which both agents continuously update inferred alignment, mental states, and short-term goals to guide strategy selection and utterance generation. Across large-scale evaluations, CALM-IT consistently outperforms strong baselines in Effectiveness and Goal Alignment and remains substantially more stable as conversation length increases. Although CALM-IT initiates fewer therapist redirections, it achieves the highest client acceptance rate (64.3%), indicating more precise and therapeutically aligned intervention timing. Overall, CALM-IT provides evidence for modeling evolving conversational state being essential for generating high-quality long-form synthetic conversations.",

We propose Codified Decision Trees (CDT), a data-driven framework that induces an executable and interpretable decision structure from large-scale narrative data. CDT represents behavioral profiles as a tree of conditional rules, where internal nodes correspond to validated scene conditions and leaves encode grounded behavioral statements, enabling deterministic retrieval of context-appropriate rules at execution time. The tree is learned by iteratively inducing candidate scene-action rules, validating them against data, and refining them through hierarchical specialization, yielding profiles that support transparent inspection and principled updates. Across multiple benchmarks, CDT substantially outperforms human-written profiles and prior profile induction methods on $85$ characters across $16$ artifacts, indicating that codified and validated behavioral representations lead to more reliable agent grounding.",

Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.",

We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.",

    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) create a severe visual feature bottleneck by using a crude, asymmetric connection that links only the output of the vision encoder to the input of the large language model (LLM). This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.",

    "summary": "Adaptive video streaming has facilitated improved video streaming over the past years. A balance among coding performance objectives such as bitrate, video quality, and decoding complexity is required to achieve efficient, content- and codec-dependent, adaptive video streaming. This paper proposes a multi-objective Pareto-front (PF) optimization framework to construct quality-monotonic, content-adaptive bitrate ladders Versatile Video Coding (VVC) streaming that jointly optimize video quality, bitrate, and decoding time, which is used as a practical proxy for decoding energy. Two strategies are introduced: the Joint Rate-Quality-Time Pareto Front (JRQT-PF) and the Joint Quality-Time Pareto Front (JQT-PF), each exploring different tradeoff formulations and objective prioritizations. The ladders are constructed under quality monotonicity constraints during adaptive streaming to ensure a consistent Quality of Experience (QoE). Experiments are conducted on a large-scale UHD dataset (Inter-4K), with quality assessed using PSNR, VMAF, and XPSNR, and complexity measured via decoding time and energy consumption. The JQT-PF method achieves 11.76% average bitrate savings while reducing average decoding time by 0.29% to maintain the same XPSNR, compared to a widely-used fixed ladder. More aggressive configurations yield up to 27.88% bitrate savings at the cost of increased complexity. The JRQT-PF strategy, on the other hand, offers more controlled tradeoffs, achieving 6.38 % bitrate savings and 6.17 % decoding time reduction. This framework outperforms existing methods, including fixed ladders, VMAF- and XPSNR-based dynamic resolution selection, and complexity-aware benchmarks. The results confirm that PF optimization with decoding time constraints enables sustainable, high-quality streaming tailored to network and device capabilities.",

Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The code and dataset will be released.",

    "title": "Semantic Misalignment in Vision-Language Models under Perceptual Degradation",
    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous driving and embodied AI systems, where reliable perception is critical for safe semantic reasoning and decision-making. While recent VLMs demonstrate strong performance on multimodal benchmarks, their robustness to realistic perception degradation remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically study semantic misalignment in VLMs under controlled degradation of upstream visual perception, using semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset as a representative perception module. We introduce perception-realistic corruptions that induce only moderate drops in conventional segmentation metrics, yet observe severe failures in downstream VLM behavior, including hallucinated object mentions, omission of safety-critical entities, and inconsistent safety judgments. To quantify these effects, we propose a set of language-level misalignment metrics that capture hallucination, critical omission, and safety misinterpretation, and analyze their relationship with segmentation quality across multiple contrastive and generative VLMs. Our results reveal a clear disconnect between pixel-level robustness and multimodal semantic reliability, highlighting a critical limitation of current VLM-based systems and motivating the need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly account for perception uncertainty in safety-critical applications.",

    "summary": "We present STEP3-VL-10B, a lightweight open-source foundation model designed to redefine the trade-off between compact efficiency and frontier-level multimodal intelligence. STEP3-VL-10B is realized through two strategic shifts: first, a unified, fully unfrozen pre-training strategy on 1.2T multimodal tokens that integrates a language-aligned Perception Encoder with a Qwen3-8B decoder to establish intrinsic vision-language synergy; and second, a scaled post-training pipeline featuring over 1k iterations of reinforcement learning. Crucially, we implement Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) to scale test-time compute, allocating resources to scalable perceptual reasoning that explores and synthesizes diverse visual hypotheses. Consequently, despite its compact 10B footprint, STEP3-VL-10B rivals or surpasses models 10$\\times$-20$\\times$ larger (e.g., GLM-4.6V-106B, Qwen3-VL-235B) and top-tier proprietary flagships like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Seed-1.5-VL.

    "summary": "Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.\n  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \\emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.\n  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.",

    "summary": "The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

    "summary": "State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.",

    "summary": "Automated perception of urban roadside infrastructure is crucial for smart city management, yet general-purpose models often struggle to capture the necessary fine-grained attributes and domain rules. While Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at open-world recognition, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex facility states in compliance with engineering standards, leading to unreliable performance in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a domain-adapted framework that transforms VLMs into specialized agents for intelligent infrastructure analysis. Our approach integrates a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy with a knowledge-grounded reasoning mechanism. Specifically, we leverage open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO to robustly localize diverse assets with minimal supervision, followed by LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning. To mitigate hallucinations and enforce professional compliance, we introduce a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that dynamically retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference. Evaluated on a comprehensive new dataset of urban roadside scenes, our framework achieves a detection performance of 58.9 mAP and an attribute recognition accuracy of 95.5%, demonstrating a robust solution for intelligent infrastructure monitoring.",

    "summary": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are usually built by stacking convolutional operations layer-by-layer. Although CNN has shown strong capability to extract semantics from raw pixels, its capacity to capture spatial relationships of pixels across rows and columns of an image is not fully explored. These relationships are important to learn semantic objects with strong shape priors but weak appearance coherences, such as traffic lanes, which are often occluded or not even painted on the road surface as shown in Fig. 1 (a). In this paper, we propose Spatial CNN (SCNN), which generalizes traditional deep layer-by-layer convolutions to slice-byslice convolutions within feature maps, thus enabling message passings between pixels across rows and columns in a layer. Such SCNN is particular suitable for long continuous shape structure or large objects, with strong spatial relationship but less appearance clues, such as traffic lanes, poles, and wall. We apply SCNN on a newly released very challenging traffic lane detection dataset and Cityscapse dataset. The results show that SCNN could learn the spatial relationship for structure output and significantly improves the performance. We show that SCNN outperforms the recurrent neural network (RNN) based ReNet and MRF+CNN (MRFNet) in the lane detection dataset by 8.7% and 4.6% respectively. Moreover, our SCNN won the 1st place on the TuSimple Benchmark Lane Detection Challenge, with an accuracy of 96.53%.",

    "summary": "Images captured in hazy and smoky environments suffer from reduced visibility, posing a challenge when monitoring infrastructures and hindering emergency services during critical situations. The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\\% train, 10\\% validation, and 10\\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges",

    "summary": "The automated creation of digital twins and precise asset inventories is a critical task in smart city construction and facility lifecycle management. However, utilizing cost-effective sparse imagery remains challenging due to limited robustness, inaccurate localization, and a lack of fine-grained state understanding. To address these limitations, SVII-3D, a unified framework for holistic asset digitization, is proposed. First, LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection is fused with a spatial-attention matching network to robustly associate observations across sparse views. Second, a geometry-guided refinement mechanism is introduced to resolve structural errors, achieving precise decimeter-level 3D localization. Third, transcending static geometric mapping, a Vision-Language Model agent leveraging multi-modal prompting is incorporated to automatically diagnose fine-grained operational states. Experiments demonstrate that SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors. Consequently, this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization, effectively bridging the gap between sparse perception and automated intelligent maintenance.",

However, challenges such as reducing computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid, progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The source code of EOIR is publicly available on https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.",

    "title": "mergetune: Continued fine-tuning of vision-language models",
    "summary": "Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, \\emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \\emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model.

    "summary": "We introduce RGS-SLAM, a robust Gaussian-splatting SLAM framework that replaces the residual-driven densification stage of GS-SLAM with a training-free correspondence-to-Gaussian initialization. Instead of progressively adding Gaussians as residuals reveal missing geometry, RGS-SLAM performs a one-shot triangulation of dense multi-view correspondences derived from DINOv3 descriptors refined through a confidence-aware inlier classifier, generating a well-distributed and structure-aware Gaussian seed prior to optimization. This initialization stabilizes early mapping and accelerates convergence by roughly 20\\%, yielding higher rendering fidelity in texture-rich and cluttered scenes while remaining fully compatible with existing GS-SLAM pipelines. Evaluated on the TUM RGB-D and Replica datasets, RGS-SLAM achieves competitive or superior localization and reconstruction accuracy compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian and point-based SLAM systems, sustaining real-time mapping performance at up to 925 FPS.

    "summary": "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been proposed to interpret model decisions in classification and, more recently, in semantic segmentation. However, instance-level XAI for semantic segmentation, namely explanations focused on a single object among multiple instances of the same class, remains largely unexplored. Such explanations are particularly important in multi-lesional diseases to understand what drives the detection and contouring of a specific lesion. We propose instance-level explanation maps for semantic segmentation by extending SmoothGrad and Grad-CAM++ to obtain quantitative instance saliency. These methods were applied to the segmentation of white matter lesions (WMLs), a magnetic resonance imaging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. We used 4023 FLAIR and MPRAGE MRI scans from 687 patients collected at the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland, with WML masks annotated by four expert clinicians. Three deep learning architectures, a 3D U-Net, nnU-Net, and Swin UNETR, were trained and evaluated, achieving normalized Dice scores of 0.71, 0.78, and 0.80, respectively. Instance saliency maps showed that the models relied primarily on FLAIR rather than MPRAGE for WML segmentation, with positive saliency inside lesions and negative saliency in their immediate neighborhood, consistent with clinical practice. Peak saliency values differed significantly across correct and incorrect predictions, suggesting that quantitative instance saliency may help identify segmentation errors. In conclusion, we introduce two architecture-agnostic XAI methods that provide quantitative instance-level explanations for semantic segmentation and support clinically meaningful interpretation of model decisions.",

    "summary": "We address the problem of estimating realistic, spatially varying reflectance for complex planetary surfaces such as the lunar regolith, which is critical for high-fidelity rendering and vision-based navigation. Existing lunar rendering pipelines rely on simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models whose parameters are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism. We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to infer a spatially varying reflectance model directly from terrain geometry.",

Two operating points are considered, corresponding to enhancement layers representing approximately 10% and 50% of the total bitrate. Subjective assessment was conducted using the Degradation Category Rating (DCR) methodology with twenty five participants, across a dataset comprising fifteen SDR and HDR sequences.

The main challenge is consistent structure preservation while enabling effective style transfer effects. The past approaches in this field directly concatenate the content and style prompts for a prompt-level style injection, leading to unavoidable structure distortions. In this work, we propose a novel solution to the text-driven style transfer task, namely, Adaptive Style Incorporation~(ASI), to achieve fine-grained feature-level style incorporation. It consists of the Siamese Cross-Attention~(SiCA) to decouple the single-track cross-attention to a dual-track structure to obtain separate content and style features, and the Adaptive Content-Style Blending (AdaBlending) module to couple the content and style information from a structure-consistent manner. Experimentally, our method exhibits much better performance in both structure preservation and stylized effects.",

    "summary": "Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or providing low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA by jointly generating quality descriptions and scores. However, existing VLM-based IQA methods often suffer from unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions, and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, with a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy for mitigating annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. The application to downstream tasks, such as image restoration, further demonstrates the effectiveness of Zoom-IQA.",

To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes with 57,431 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a 3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments.

Specifically, we employ a union encoder to jointly encode the visual and textual inputs, generating aligned visual and text embeddings as well as multimodal class tokens. A bidirectional hierarchical fusion module is introduced to adapt SAM2 to RS scenes and align adapted visual features with the visually enhanced text embeddings, improving the model's interpretation of text-described RS scenes. To provide precise target cues for SAM2, we design a mask prompt generator, which takes the visual embeddings and class tokens as input and produces a pseudo-mask as the dense prompt of SAM2. Experimental results on several RRSIS benchmarks demonstrate that RS2-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "summary": "Most models of generative AI for images assume that images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent or the manifold's coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined or considered uniform. In this study, we address the problem of Blind Image Denoising (BID), and to some extent, the problem of generating images from noise by unifying geometric and probabilistic perspectives. We introduce a novel framework that improves upon existing probabilistic approaches by incorporating geometric assumptions that enable the effective use of kernel-based probabilistic methods. Furthermore, the proposed framework extends prior geometric approaches by combining explicit and implicit manifold descriptions through the introduction of a distance function. The resulting framework demystifies diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM), which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space. We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of image restoration and generation.",

However, despite their empirical success, these methods are poorly understood from a theoretical perspective and often treated as black boxes. To bridge this gap, we analyze trained neural networks through the lens of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, incorporating functional constraints that capture two fundamental inductive biases of CNNs: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. Under the empirical training distribution, we derive an analytic, interpretable, and tractable formula for this constrained variant, termed Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE). Through extensive numerical experiments across various inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP), we demonstrate that our theory matches the neural networks outputs (PSNR $\\gtrsim25$dB). Furthermore, we provide insights into the differences between \\emph{physics-aware} and \\emph{physics-agnostic} estimators, the impact of high-density regions in the training (patch) distribution, and the influence of other factors (dataset size, patch size, etc).",

    "summary": "Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.",

    "summary": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

    "summary": "Large image collections generated from camera traps offer valuable insights into species richness, occupancy, and activity patterns, significantly aiding biodiversity monitoring. However, the manual processing of these datasets is time-consuming, hindering analytical processes. To address this, deep neural networks have been widely adopted to automate image labelling, but the impact of classification error on key ecological metrics remains unclear. Here, we analyse data from camera trap collections in an African savannah (82,300 labelled images, 47 species) and an Asian sub-tropical dry forest (40,308 labelled images, 29 species) to compare ecological metrics derived from expert-generated species identifications with those generated by deep learning classification models. We specifically assess the impact of deep learning model architecture, proportion of label noise in the training data, and the size of the training dataset on three key ecological metrics: species richness, occupancy, and activity patterns. We found that predictions of species richness derived from deep neural networks closely match those calculated from expert labels and remained resilient to up to 10% noise in the training dataset (mis-labelled images) and a 50% reduction in the training dataset size. We found that our choice of deep learning model architecture (ResNet vs ConvNext-T) or depth (ResNet18, 50, 101) did not impact predicted ecological metrics. In contrast, species-specific metrics were more sensitive; less common and visually similar species were disproportionately affected by a reduction in deep neural network accuracy, with consequences for occupancy and diel activity pattern estimates. To ensure the reliability of their findings, practitioners should prioritize creating large, clean training sets and account for class imbalance across species over exploring numerous deep learning model architectures.",

    "summary": "Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.",

    "summary": "The synthesis of computed tomography (CT) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cone-beam CT (CBCT) plays a critical role in clinical treatment planning by enabling accurate anatomical representation in adaptive radiotherapy. In this work, we propose GANeXt, a 3D patch-based, fully ConvNeXt-powered generative adversarial network for unified CT synthesis across different modalities and anatomical regions. Specifically, GANeXt employs an efficient U-shaped generator constructed from stacked 3D ConvNeXt blocks with compact convolution kernels, while the discriminator adopts a conditional PatchGAN. To improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a combination of loss functions, including mean absolute error (MAE), perceptual loss, segmentation-based masked MAE, and adversarial loss and a combination of Dice loss and cross-entropy for multi-head segmentation discriminator. For both tasks, training is performed with a batch size of 8 using two separate AdamW optimizers for the generator and discriminator, each equipped with a warmup and cosine decay scheduler, with learning rates of $5\\times10^{-4}$ and $1\\times10^{-3}$, respectively. Data preprocessing includes deformable registration, foreground cropping, percentile normalization for the input modality, and linear normalization of the CT to the range $[-1024, 1000]$. Data augmentation involves random zooming within $(0.8, 1.3)$ (for MRI-to-CT only), fixed-size cropping to $32\\times160\\times192$ for MRI-to-CT and $32\\times128\\times128$ for CBCT-to-CT, and random flipping. During inference, we apply a sliding-window approach with $0.8$ overlap and average folding to reconstruct the full-size sCT, followed by inversion of the CT normalization. After joint training on all regions without any fine-tuning, the final models are selected at the end of 3000 epochs for MRI-to-CT and 1000 epochs for CBCT-to-CT using the full training dataset.",

    "summary": "High-resolution mapping of canopy height is essential for forest management and biodiversity monitoring. Although recent studies have led to the advent of deep learning methods using satellite imagery to predict height maps, these approaches often face a trade-off between data accessibility and spatial resolution. To overcome these limitations, we present SERA-H, an end-to-end model combining a super-resolution module (EDSR) and temporal attention encoding (UTAE). Trained under the supervision of high-density LiDAR data (ALS), our model generates 2.5 m resolution height maps from freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) time series data. Evaluated on an open-source benchmark dataset in France, SERA-H, with a MAE of 2.6 m and a coefficient of determination of 0.82, not only outperforms standard Sentinel-1/2 baselines but also achieves performance comparable to or better than methods relying on commercial very high-resolution imagery (SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope, Maxar). These results demonstrate that combining high-resolution supervision with the spatiotemporal information embedded in time series enables the reconstruction of details beyond the input sensors' native resolution. SERA-H opens the possibility of freely mapping forests with high revisit frequency, achieving accuracy comparable to that of costly commercial imagery.",

We address this by integrating Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence. Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without loss of stability. To mimic constrained-data scenarios, we evaluate our approach on ImageNet-1K pre-training and ADE20K fine-tuning using randomly sampled subsets of each dataset. Under this setting, DBP-MAE reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon emissions by 21.4%, and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data, confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.\n  Keywords: Deep learning, Vision transformers, Efficient AI, Decorrelation",

    "summary": "State-of-the-art Diffusion Models (DMs) produce highly realistic images. While prior work has successfully mitigated Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content in the visual domain, we identify a novel threat: the generation of NSFW text embedded within images. This includes offensive language, such as insults, racial slurs, and sexually explicit terms, posing significant risks to users. We show that all state-of-the-art DMs (e.g., SD3, SDXL, Flux, DeepFloyd IF) are vulnerable to this issue. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that existing mitigation techniques, effective for visual content, fail to prevent harmful text generation while substantially degrading benign text generation. As an initial step toward addressing this threat, we introduce a novel fine-tuning strategy that targets only the text-generation layers in DMs. Therefore, we construct a safety fine-tuning dataset by pairing each NSFW prompt with two images: one with the NSFW term, and another where that term is replaced with a carefully crafted benign alternative while leaving the image unchanged otherwise. By training on this dataset, the model learns to avoid generating harmful text while preserving benign content and overall image quality. Finally, to advance research in the area, we release ToxicBench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating NSFW text generation in images. It includes our curated fine-tuning dataset, a set of harmful prompts, new evaluation metrics, and a pipeline that assesses both NSFW-ness and text and image quality. Our benchmark aims to guide future efforts in mitigating NSFW text generation in text-to-image models, thereby contributing to their safe deployment.",

It is built upon three key principles: multi-timestamp question answering, hierarchical question structures spanning perception and reasoning, and multi-dimensional evaluation of continuous perception, understanding, and reasoning. RTV-Bench comprises 552 diverse videos and 4,608 carefully curated QA pairs covering a wide range of dynamic scenarios. We evaluate a broad range of state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary, open-source offline, and open-source real-time models. Our results show that real-time models generally outperform offline counterparts but still lag behind leading proprietary systems. While scaling model capacity generally yields performance gains, simply increasing the density of sampled input frames does not consistently translate into improved results.

    "summary": "Imagine sitting in a presentation, trying to follow the speaker while simultaneously scanning the slides for relevant information. While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases.

This is achieved by combining custom tailored imaging hardware with dedicated detection and tracking algorithms, enabling the quantification of larvae, filled/empty pupae and flies over multiple days. Given the affordable and reproducible design of the Hatching-Box in combination with our generic client/server-based software, the system can easily be scaled to monitor an arbitrary amount of rearing vials simultaneously. We evaluated our system on a curated image dataset comprising nearly 470,000 annotated objects and performed several studies on real world experiments. We successfully reproduced results from well-established circadian experiments by comparing the eclosion periods of wild type flies to the clock mutants $\\textit{per}^{short}$, $\\textit{per}^{long}$ and $\\textit{per}^0$ without involvement of any manual labor. Furthermore we show, that the Hatching-Box is able to extract additional information about group behavior as well as to reconstruct the whole life-cycle of the individual specimens. These results not only demonstrate the applicability of our system for long-term experiments but also indicate its benefits for automated monitoring in the general cultivation process.",

    "summary": "Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a pivotal technology in low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) reconnaissance missions, enabling robust target detection and tracking by integrating thermal saliency with environmental textures. However, traditional no-reference metrics (Statistics-based metrics and Gradient-based metrics) fail in complex low-light environments, termed the ``Noise Trap''. This paper mathematically prove that these metrics are positively correlated with high-frequency sensor noise, paradoxically assigning higher scores to degraded images and misguiding algorithm optimization. To address this, we propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric. Inspired by Weber's Law, TBC focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets rather than global statistics. Unlike traditional metrics, TBC penalizes background noise and rewards target visibility. Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate the superiority of TBC. Results show that TBC exhibits high ``Semantic Discriminability'' in distinguishing thermal targets from background clutter. Furthermore, TBC achieves remarkable computational efficiency, making it a reliable and real-time standard for intelligent UAV systems.",

    "title": "Beyond Inpainting: Unleash 3D Understanding for Precise Camera-Controlled Video Generation",
    "summary": "Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.",

Data augmentation -- particularly mask-based information dropping -- can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and risk discarding essential semantics. We propose Granular Ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular Ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements not only in image classification and masked image reconstruction, but also in image tampering detection, validating the effectiveness and generalization of GBGM across both recognition and forensic scenarios. Simple and model-agnostic, GBGM integrates seamlessly into CNNs and Vision Transformers, offering a practical paradigm for structure-aware data augmentation.",

    "summary": "Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count to approximately 23% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer. Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality, we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than 8x faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.",

    "summary": "Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics. Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction, leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations. This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose RSFMs across all downstream tasks.

    "summary": "Remote sensing novel view synthesis (NVS) offers significant potential for 3D interpretation of remote sensing scenes, with important applications in urban planning and environmental monitoring. However, remote sensing scenes frequently lack sufficient multi-view images due to acquisition constraints. While existing NVS methods tend to overfit when processing limited input views, advanced few-shot NVS methods are computationally intensive and perform sub-optimally in remote sensing scenes. This paper presents TriDF, an efficient hybrid 3D representation for fast remote sensing NVS from as few as 3 input views. Our approach decouples color and volume density information, modeling them independently to reduce the computational burden on implicit radiance fields and accelerate reconstruction.We explore the potential of the triplane representation in few-shot NVS tasks by mapping high-frequency color information onto this compact structure, and the direct optimization of feature planes significantly speeds up convergence. Volume density is modeled as continuous density fields, incorporating reference features from neighboring views through image-based rendering to compensate for limited input data. Additionally, we introduce depth-guided optimization based on point clouds, which effectively mitigates the overfitting problem in few-shot NVS.Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing scenes demonstrate that our hybrid representation achieves a 30x speed increase compared to NeRF-based methods, while simultaneously improving rendering quality metrics over advanced few-shot methods (7.4% increase in PSNR and 3.4% in SSIM).

Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.",

    "summary": "All-in-one image restoration aims to adaptively handle multiple restoration tasks with a single trained model. Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed OPIR, is extensively validated through experiments, demonstrating superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration.",

    "summary": "Because of their high temporal resolution, increased resilience to motion blur, and very sparse output, event cameras have been shown to be ideal for low-latency and low-bandwidth feature tracking, even in challenging scenarios. Existing feature tracking methods for event cameras are either handcrafted or derived from first principles but require extensive parameter tuning, are sensitive to noise, and do not generalize to different scenarios due to unmodeled effects. To tackle these deficiencies, we introduce the first data-driven feature tracker for event cameras, which leverages low-latency events to track features detected in an intensity frame. We achieve robust performance via a novel frame attention module, which shares information across feature tracks. Our tracker is designed to operate in two distinct configurations: solely with events or in a hybrid mode incorporating both events and frames. The hybrid model offers two setups: an aligned configuration where the event and frame cameras share the same viewpoint, and a hybrid stereo configuration where the event camera and the standard camera are positioned side-by-side. This side-by-side arrangement is particularly valuable as it provides depth information for each feature track, enhancing its utility in applications such as visual odometry and simultaneous localization and mapping.",

    "summary": "Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.",

To address these limitations, we propose RealCamo, a novel out-painting-based framework for controllable realistic camouflaged image generation. RealCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multimodal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images.

    "summary": "Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model.

    "summary": "Recently, the mainstream practice for training low-light raw image denoising methods has shifted towards employing synthetic data. Noise modeling, which focuses on characterizing the noise distribution of real-world sensors, profoundly influences the effectiveness and practicality of synthetic data. Currently, physics-based noise modeling struggles to characterize the entire real noise distribution, while learning-based noise modeling impractically depends on paired real data. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy: learning the noise model from dark frames instead of paired real data, to break down the data dependency. Based on this strategy, we introduce an efficient physics-informed noise neural proxy (PNNP) to approximate the real-world sensor noise model. Specifically, we integrate physical priors into neural proxies and introduce three efficient techniques: physics-guided noise decoupling (PND), physics-aware proxy model (PPM), and differentiable distribution loss (DDL). PND decouples the dark frame into different components and handles different levels of noise flexibly, which reduces the complexity of noise modeling. PPM incorporates physical priors to constrain the synthetic noise, which promotes the accuracy of noise modeling. DDL provides explicit and reliable supervision for noise distribution, which promotes the precision of noise modeling. PNNP exhibits powerful potential in characterizing the real noise distribution. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate superior performance in practical low-light raw image denoising. The source code will be publicly available at the project homepage.",

    "summary": "Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant \"retrieve-then-prompt\" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.",

    "summary": "The Video Browser Showdown (VBS) challenges systems to deliver accurate results under strict time constraints. To meet this demand, we present Fusionista2.0, a streamlined video retrieval system optimized for speed and usability. All core modules were re-engineered for efficiency: preprocessing now relies on ffmpeg for fast keyframe extraction, optical character recognition uses Vintern-1B-v3.5 for robust multilingual text recognition, and automatic speech recognition employs faster-whisper for real-time transcription. For question answering, lightweight vision-language models provide quick responses without the heavy cost of large models. Beyond these technical upgrades, Fusionista2.0 introduces a redesigned user interface with improved responsiveness, accessibility, and workflow efficiency, enabling even non-expert users to retrieve relevant content rapidly. Evaluations demonstrate that retrieval time was reduced by up to 75% while accuracy and user satisfaction both increased, confirming Fusionista2.0 as a competitive and user-friendly system for large-scale video search.",

    "summary": "Detecting small objects in UAV remote sensing images and identifying surface defects in industrial inspection remain difficult tasks. These applications face common obstacles: features are sparse and weak, backgrounds are cluttered, and object scales vary dramatically. Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily.\n  We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency.\n  We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs. Strong performance across two very different domains confirms that DFIR-DETR generalizes well and works effectively in resource-limited settings for cross-scene small object detection.",

    "summary": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as abnormality detection and report generation for anatomical modalities, their capability in functional imaging remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

    "summary": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify instances from both known and novel categories within a large-scale unlabeled dataset, a critical yet challenging task for real-world, open-world applications. However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that InfoSculpt validating the effectiveness of our information-theoretic approach.",

    "summary": "Weight Averaging (WA) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing generalization by promoting convergence to a flat loss landscape, which correlates with stronger out-of-distribution performance. However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions. Extensive experiments on MMDG benchmarks show that MBCD consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse unseen domains.",

However, point-cloud-based radar representations suffer from information loss due to multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar tensors incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that efficiently fuses raw 4D radar cubes with camera images via decoupled multi-view radar representations. Our approach introduces two key components: (1) A Wavelet Attention Module embedded in a wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), which enhances the representation of sparse radar signals and image data by capturing joint spatial-frequency features, thereby mitigating information loss while maintaining computational efficiency. (2) A Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion mechanism, a two-stage query-based fusion strategy that progressively aligns multi-view radar and visual features through geometric priors, enabling modality-agnostic and efficient integration without overwhelming computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the K-Radar benchmark show that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the best existing model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in sleet conditions, demonstrating strong robustness in adverse weather.",

Diagnosing ADHD using neuroimaging data, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous presentations and overlapping symptoms with other conditions. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning approach that adapts a large-scale 3D convolutional foundation model, pre-trained on CT images, to an MRI-based ADHD classification task. Our method introduces Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in 3D by factorizing 3D convolutional kernels into 2D low-rank updates, dramatically reducing trainable parameters while achieving superior performance. In a five-fold cross-validated evaluation on a public diffusion MRI database, our 3D LoRA fine-tuning strategy achieved state-of-the-art results, with one model variant reaching 71.9% accuracy and another attaining an AUC of 0.716. Both variants use only 1.64 million trainable parameters (over 113x fewer than a fully fine-tuned foundation model). Our results represent one of the first successful cross-modal (CT-to-MRI) adaptations of a foundation model in neuroimaging, establishing a new benchmark for ADHD classification while greatly improving efficiency.",

However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.\n  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.\n  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.",

Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation. Our results demonstrate a 5-20x speed-up over coordinate-based MLP-based methods, solving differential equations in seconds or minutes while maintaining comparable accuracy and compactness.",

We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.",

Moreover, we assess CEPAM's utility performance through experimental evaluations, including convergence profiles compared with other baselines, and accuracy-privacy trade-offs between different parties.",

To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available. Numerical studies are presented for three challenging test problems, where we demonstrate excellent generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.",

We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent's context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.",

    "summary": "We study the benefits of sparsity in nonparametric contextual bandit problems, in which the set of candidate features is countably or uncountably infinite. Our contribution is two-fold. First, using a novel reduction to sequences of multi-armed bandit problems, we provide lower bounds on the minimax regret, which show that polynomial dependence on the number of actions is generally unavoidable in this setting. Second, we show that a variant of the Feel-Good Thompson Sampling algorithm enjoys regret bounds that match our lower bounds up to logarithmic factors of the horizon, and have logarithmic dependence on the effective number of candidate features. When we apply our results to kernelised and neural contextual bandits, we find that sparsity enables better regret bounds whenever the horizon is large enough relative to the sparsity and the number of actions.",

    "summary": "Multi-behavior recommendation faces a critical challenge in practice: auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, carts) are often noisy, weakly correlated, or semantically misaligned with the target behavior (e.g., purchase), which leads to biased preference learning and suboptimal performance. While existing methods attempt to fuse these heterogeneous signals, they inherently lack a principled mechanism to ensure robustness against such behavioral inconsistency.\n  In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors (RMBRec), a robust multi-behavior recommendation framework grounded in an information-theoretic robustness principle. We interpret robustness as a joint process of maximizing predictive information while minimizing its variance across heterogeneous behavioral environments. Under this perspective, the Representation Robustness Module (RRM) enhances local semantic consistency by maximizing the mutual information between users' auxiliary and target representations, whereas the Optimization Robustness Module (ORM) enforces global stability by minimizing the variance of predictive risks across behaviors, which is an efficient approximation to invariant risk minimization. This local-global collaboration bridges representation purification and optimization invariance in a theoretically coherent way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RMBRec not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy but also maintains remarkable stability under various noise perturbations.

    "summary": "Adjusted similarity measures, such as Cohen's kappa for inter-rater reliability and the adjusted Rand index used to compare clustering algorithms, are a vital tool for comparing discrete labellings. These measures are intended to have the property of 0 expectation under a null distribution and maximum value 1 under maximal similarity to aid in interpretation. Measures are frequently adjusted with respect to the permutation distribution for historic and analytic reasons. There is currently renewed interest in considering other null models more appropriate for context, such as clustering ensembles permitting a random number of identified clusters. The purpose of this work is two -- fold: (1) to generalize the study of the adjustment operator to general null models and to a more general procedure which includes statistical standardization as a special case and (2) to identify sufficient conditions for the adjustment operator to produce the intended properties, where sufficient conditions are related to whether and how observed data are incorporated into null distributions. We demonstrate how violations of the sufficient conditions may lead to substantial breakdown, such as by producing a non-positive measure under traditional adjustment rather than one with mean 0, or by producing a measure which is deterministically 0 under statistical standardization.",

    "title": "STEM: Scaling Transformers with Embedding Modules",
    "summary": "Fine-grained sparsity promises higher parametric capacity without proportional per-token compute, but often suffers from training instability, load balancing, and communication overhead. We introduce STEM (Scaling Transformers with Embedding Modules), a static, token-indexed approach that replaces the FFN up-projection with a layer-local embedding lookup while keeping the gate and down-projection dense. This removes runtime routing, enables CPU offload with asynchronous prefetch, and decouples capacity from both per-token FLOPs and cross-device communication. Empirically, STEM trains stably despite extreme sparsity. It improves downstream performance over dense baselines while reducing per-token FLOPs and parameter accesses (eliminating roughly one-third of FFN parameters). STEM learns embedding spaces with large angular spread which enhances its knowledge storage capacity. More interestingly, this enhanced knowledge capacity comes with better interpretability. The token-indexed nature of STEM embeddings allows simple ways to perform knowledge editing and knowledge injection in an interpretable manner without any intervention in the input text or additional computation. In addition, STEM strengthens long-context performance: as sequence length grows, more distinct parameters are activated, yielding practical test-time capacity scaling. Across 350M and 1B model scales, STEM delivers up to ~3--4% accuracy improvements overall, with notable gains on knowledge and reasoning-heavy benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, OpenBookQA, GSM8K, MMLU). Overall, STEM is an effective way of scaling parametric memory while providing better interpretability, better training stability and improved efficiency.",

    "summary": "Estimating the Riesz representer is central to debiased machine learning for causal and structural parameter estimation. We propose generalized Riesz regression, a unified framework that estimates the Riesz representer by fitting a representer model via Bregman divergence minimization. This framework includes the squared loss and the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence as special cases: the former recovers Riesz regression, while the latter recovers tailored loss minimization. Under suitable model specifications, the dual problems correspond to covariate balancing, which we call automatic covariate balancing. Moreover, under the same specifications, outcome averages weighted by the estimated Riesz representer satisfy Neyman orthogonality even without estimating the regression function, a property we call automatic Neyman orthogonalization. This property not only reduces the estimation error of Neyman orthogonal scores but also clarifies a key distinction between debiased machine learning and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Our framework can also be viewed as a generalization of density ratio fitting under Bregman divergences to Riesz representer estimation, and it applies beyond density ratio estimation. We provide convergence analyses for both reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and neural network model classes.

While the information gain has an attractive information-theoretic interpretation, the effective dimension typically results in better rates. We introduce a new quantity called the relative information gain, which measures the sensitivity of the information gain with respect to the observation noise. We show that the relative information gain smoothly interpolates between the effective dimension and the information gain, and that the relative information gain has the same growth rate as the effective dimension. In the second half of the paper, we prove a new PAC-Bayesian excess risk bound for Gaussian process regression. The relative information gain arises naturally from the complexity term in this PAC-Bayesian bound. We prove bounds on the relative information gain that depend on the spectral properties of the kernel. When these upper bounds are combined with our excess risk bound, we obtain minimax-optimal rates of convergence.",

Standard factor models applied to covariates alone often lose explanatory power for responses. Our approach uses anisotropic diffusion maps, a manifold learning technique, to learn low-dimensional embeddings that preserve both the intrinsic geometry of the covariates and the predictive relationship with responses. For time series arising from Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space, we show that the associated graph Laplacian converges to the generator of the underlying diffusion. We further establish a bound on the approximation error between the diffusion map coordinates and linear diffusion processes, and we show that ergodic averages in the embedding space converge under standard spectral assumptions. These results justify using Kalman filtering in diffusion-map coordinates for predicting joint covariate-response evolution. We apply this methodology to equity-portfolio stress testing using macroeconomic and financial variables from Federal Reserve supervisory scenarios, achieving mean absolute error improvements of up to 55% over classical scenario analysis and 39% over principal component analysis benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Classification imbalance arises when one class is much rarer than the other. We frame this setting as transfer learning under label (prior) shift between an imbalanced source distribution induced by the observed data and a balanced target distribution under which performance is evaluated. Within this framework, we study a family of oversampling procedures that augment the training data by generating synthetic samples from an estimated minority-class distribution to roughly balance the classes, among which the celebrated SMOTE algorithm is a canonical example. We show that the excess risk decomposes into the rate achievable under balanced training (as if the data had been drawn from the balanced target distribution) and an additional term, the cost of transfer, which quantifies the discrepancy between the estimated and true minority-class distributions. In particular, we show that the cost of transfer for SMOTE dominates that of bootstrapping (random oversampling) in moderately high dimensions, suggesting that we should expect bootstrapping to have better performance than SMOTE in general. We corroborate these findings with experimental evidence. More broadly, our results provide guidance for choosing among augmentation strategies for imbalanced classification.",

    "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \\emph{over-the-air FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \\emph{frenemy} in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms, formally quantified by \\emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains, nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station (BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as a \\emph{perk} even \\emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive numerical results.",

    "summary": "Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to protect sensitive data during the training of machine learning models, but its privacy guarantee often comes at a large cost of model performance due to the lack of tight theoretical bounds quantifying privacy loss. While recent efforts have achieved more accurate privacy guarantees, they still impose some assumptions prohibited from practical applications, such as convexity and complex parameter requirements, and rarely investigate in-depth the impact of privacy mechanisms on the model's utility. In this paper, we provide a rigorous privacy characterization for DPSGD with general L-smooth and non-convex loss functions, revealing converged privacy loss with iteration in bounded-domain cases. Specifically, we track the privacy loss over multiple iterations, leveraging the noisy smooth-reduction property, and further establish comprehensive convergence analysis in different scenarios. In particular, we show that for DPSGD with a bounded domain, (i) the privacy loss can still converge without the convexity assumption, (ii) a smaller bounded diameter can improve both privacy and utility simultaneously under certain conditions, and (iii) the attainable big-O order of the privacy utility trade-off for DPSGD with gradient clipping (DPSGD-GC) and for DPSGD-GC with bounded domain (DPSGD-DC) and mu-strongly convex population risk function, respectively.

TPV is a fully label-free object whose trace form separates the geometry of the trained model from the specific perturbation mechanism, allowing a broad family of parameter perturbations like SGD noise, label noise, finite-precision noise, and other post-training perturbations to be analyzed under a single framework. Theoretically, we show that TPV estimated on the training set converges to its test-set value in the overparameterized limit, providing the first result that prediction variance under local parameter perturbations can be inferred from training inputs alone. Empirically, TPV exhibits a striking stability across datasets and architectures -- including extremely narrow networks -- and correlates well with clean test loss. Finally, we demonstrate that modeling pruning as a TPV perturbation yields a simple label-free importance measure that performs competitively with state-of-the-art pruning methods, illustrating the practical utility of TPV.

    "title": "MixMin: Finding Data Mixtures via Convex Minimization",
    "summary": "Modern machine learning pipelines are increasingly combining and mixing data from diverse and disparate sources, e.g., pre-training large language models. Yet, finding the optimal data mixture is a challenging and open problem. We formalize this data mixing problem as a bi-level objective: the best mixture is the one that would lead to the best model for a downstream objective. Unfortunately, this objective is generally intractable. In this paper, we make the observation that the bi-level data mixing objective becomes convex as our model class becomes larger. We develop and study a gradient-based approach for optimizing this convex objective, which we call MixMin, and test it on language modeling and chemistry tasks. MixMin was the only method that uniformly improved the data mixture in all our experiments. With MixMin, we improved the data mixture using less than 0.2% additional compute for a pythia-410M model trained on 8.2B tokens, resulting between 1-5% relative improvement to negative log likelihood on PIQA, ARC Easy, SciQ, and OpenWebMath. Crucially, we found that MixMin mixtures for smaller models improved training of larger models, suggesting that MixMin mixtures may be scale-invariant. When mixing bioassay data to train an XGBoost model, we saw improvements to average precision scores of 0.03-0.15.",

    "summary": "Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.",

Rooted in Kolmogorov's representation theorem, KANs utilize adaptive spline-based activation functions and grid-based structures, providing a transformative approach compared to traditional neural network frameworks. Utilizing a variety of datasets spanning mathematical function estimation (quadratic and cubic) to practical uses like predicting daily temperatures and categorizing wines, the proposed research thoroughly assesses model performance via accuracy measures like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and computational expense assessed through Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). The results indicate that KANs reliably exceed MLPs in every benchmark, attaining higher predictive accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs. Such an outcome highlights their ability to maintain a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, rendering them especially beneficial in resource-limited and real-time operational environments. By elucidating the architectural and functional distinctions between KANs and MLPs, the paper provides a systematic framework for selecting the most suitable neural architectures for specific tasks. Furthermore, the proposed study highlights the transformative capabilities of KANs in progressing intelligent systems, influencing their use in situations that require both interpretability and computational efficiency.",

    "summary": "Meta-learning aims to leverage information across related tasks to improve prediction on unlabeled data for new tasks when only a small number of labeled observations are available (\"few-shot\" learning). Increased task diversity is often believed to enhance meta-learning by providing richer information across tasks. However, recent work by Kumar et al. (2022) shows that increasing task diversity, quantified through the overall geometric spread of task representations, can in fact degrade meta-learning prediction performance across a range of models and datasets. In this work, we build on this observation by showing that meta-learning performance is affected not only by the overall geometric variability of task parameters, but also by how this variability is allocated relative to an underlying low-dimensional structure. Similar to Pimonova et al. (2025), we decompose task-specific regression effects into a structurally informative component and an orthogonal, non-informative component. We show theoretically and through simulation that meta-learning prediction degrades when a larger fraction of between-task variability lies in orthogonal, non-informative directions, even when the overall geometric variability of tasks is held fixed.",

While asymptotic error exponents for this problem are well-studied, the finite-sample regime remains poorly understood. We bridge this gap by characterizing the sample complexity -- the minimum number of state copies required to achieve a target error level. Specifically, we derive lower bounds that generalize the sample complexity of simple QHT and introduce new upper bounds for various uncertainty sets, including of both finite and infinite cardinalities. Notably, our upper and lower bounds match up to universal constants, providing a tight characterization of the sample complexity. Finally, we extend our analysis to the differentially private setting, establishing the sample complexity for privacy-preserving composite QHT.",

    "summary": "The predominance of machine learning models in many spheres of human activity has led to a growing demand for their transparency. The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work. The results obtained from real data sets highlight the competitiveness of our approach compared to other existing methods as well as certain opaque models.

We argue that Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity represents an intrinsic topological distance between topological quantum many-body phases of matter, and as such plays a central role in interpretable manifold learning of topological order. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with quantum Fisher complexity (Bures distance) and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed distance measures, unsupervised manifold learning of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, is conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Moreover, we find that the entanglement-based approach, which captures the long-range structure of quantum entanglement of topological orders, is more robust to local Haar random noises. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, quantum metrology, and machine learning of topological quantum order.",

By training a GPT-2 model on a dataset of existing modulation formulas, new modulation schemes has been created. These generated schemes are then compared to traditional methods using key performance metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Power Spectrum Density (PSD). The results show that Transformer-generated modulation schemes can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases outperforming, traditional methods.

    "summary": "The scaling of model and data sizes has reshaped the AI landscape, establishing finetuning pretrained models as the standard paradigm for solving downstream tasks. However, dominant finetuning methods typically rely on weight adaptation, often lack interpretability, and depend on heuristically chosen hyperparameters. In this paper, we take a different perspective and shift the focus from weights to activation functions, viewing them through the lens of spline operators. We propose Curvature Tuning (CT), an interpretable and principled steering method that modulates a model's decision boundary by injecting a single hyperparameter into its activation functions. We show that CT provably adjusts model decision boundary curvature and, more fundamentally, projects a model onto a space of smooth functions-thereby complementing current finetuning methods, whose effect lies primarily in feature adaptation. Making this hyperparameter trainable gives rise to a novel and highly parameter-efficient finetuning method. Empirically, CT improves both generalization and robustness. For example, it boosts downstream accuracy of ResNet-50/152 by 8.59%/8.34% over linear probing and 4.64%/1.70% over LoRA across 12 datasets, and improves robust accuracy on the $\\ell_\\infty$ benchmark from RobustBench by 1032.64%/1494.46%.

    "summary": "With grid operators confronting rising uncertainty from renewable integration and a broader push toward electrification, Demand-Side Management (DSM) -- particularly Demand Response (DR) -- has attracted significant attention as a cost-effective mechanism for balancing modern electricity systems. Unprecedented volumes of consumption data from a continuing global deployment of smart meters enable consumer segmentation based on real usage behaviours, promising to inform the design of more effective DSM and DR programs. However, existing clustering-based segmentation methods insufficiently reflect the behavioural diversity of consumers, often relying on rigid temporal alignment, and faltering in the presence of anomalies, missing data, or large-scale deployments.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage clustering framework -- Clustered Representations Optimising Consumer Segmentation (CROCS). In the first stage, each consumer's daily load profiles are clustered independently to form a Representative Load Set (RLS), providing a compact summary of their typical diurnal consumption behaviours. In the second stage, consumers are clustered using the Weighted Sum of Minimum Distances (WSMD), a novel set-to-set measure that compares RLSs by accounting for both the prevalence and similarity of those behaviours. Finally, community detection on the WSMD-induced graph reveals higher-order prototypes that embody the shared diurnal behaviours defining consumer groups, enhancing the interpretability of the resulting clusters.\n  Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real Australian smart meter datasets demonstrate that CROCS captures intra-consumer variability, uncovers both synchronous and asynchronous behavioural similarities, and remains robust to anomalies and missing data, while scaling efficiently through natural parallelisation.

    "summary": "Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.",

CDTD is based on a novel combination of score matching and score interpolation to enforce a unified continuous noise distribution for both continuous and categorical features. We explicitly acknowledge the necessity of homogenizing distinct data types by relying on model-specific loss calibration and initialization schemes. To further address the high heterogeneity in mixed-type tabular data, we introduce adaptive feature- or type-specific noise schedules. These ensure balanced generative performance across features and optimize the allocation of model capacity across features and diffusion time. Our experimental results show that CDTD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark models, captures feature correlations exceptionally well, and that heterogeneity in the noise schedule design boosts sample quality.

We provide a rigorous proof that this localization guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on the gradient variance: $Var[\\partial θ] \\in Ω(1/poly(N))$. Crucially, unlike approaches that avoid BPs by limiting entanglement, we demonstrate that H-EFT-VA maintains volume-law entanglement and near-Haar purity, ensuring sufficient expressibility for complex quantum states. Extensive benchmarking across 16 experiments -- including Transverse Field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models -- confirms a 109x improvement in energy convergence and a 10.7x increase in ground-state fidelity over standard Hardware-Efficient Ansatze (HEA), with a statistical significance of $p < 10^{-88}$.",

    "summary": "Dimensionality reduction is a powerful technique for revealing structure and potential clusters in data. However, as the axes are complex, non-linear combinations of features, they often lack semantic interpretability. Existing visual analytics (VA) methods support cluster interpretation through feature comparison and interactive exploration, but they require technical expertise and intense human effort. We present \\textit{LangLasso}, a novel method that complements VA approaches through interactive, natural language descriptions of clusters using large language models (LLMs). It produces human-readable descriptions that make cluster interpretation accessible to non-experts and allow integration of external contextual knowledge beyond the dataset. We systematically evaluate the reliability of these explanations and demonstrate that \\langlasso provides an effective first step for engaging broader audiences in cluster interpretation.

    "summary": "Modal methods are a long-standing approach to physical modelling synthesis. Extensions to nonlinear problems are possible, including the case of a high-amplitude vibration of a string. A modal decomposition leads to a densely coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in scalar auxiliary variable techniques has enabled construction of explicit and stable numerical solvers for such classes of nonlinear systems. On the other hand, machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) have been successful in modelling nonlinear systems automatically from data. In this work, we examine how scalar auxiliary variable techniques can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations to yield a stable differentiable model capable of learning nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes so that physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the model architecture. As a proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for the nonlinear transverse vibration of a string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.",

    "summary": "We study tabular reinforcement learning problems with multiple steps of lookahead information. Before acting, the learner observes $\\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments. Our regret bounds are order-optimal up to a potential factor of the lookahead horizon $\\ell$, which can usually be considered a small constant.",

    "summary": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy optimization from static datasets but is inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates against representative safety-constrained algorithms with a minimal 5% poisoning budget, while maintaining the agent's performance in clean environments.",

Sample generation via gradual denoising or demasking processes allows them to capture hierarchical non-sequential interdependencies in the data. These custom processes, however, do not assume a flexible control over the distribution of generated samples. We propose Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors, a framework that allows for controlling the generated distribution of discrete masked diffusion models at inference time. We derive Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms that, given a trained discrete diffusion model, control the temperature of the sampled distribution (i.e. perform annealing), sample from the product of marginals of several diffusion processes (e.g. differently conditioned processes), and sample from the product of the marginal with an external reward function, producing likely samples from the target distribution that also have high reward. Notably, our framework does not require any training of additional models or fine-tuning of the original model. We illustrate the utility of our framework in several applications including: efficient sampling from the annealed Boltzmann distribution of the Ising model, improving the performance of language models for code generation and amortized learning, as well as reward-tilted protein sequence generation.",

DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated problems and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning.",

    "summary": "Machine learning models deployed in nonstationary environments inevitably experience performance degradation due to data drift. While numerous drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining decisions should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy-based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium statistical physics. Interpreting drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker-Planck equation, we quantify model-data mismatch using relative entropy and show that its time derivative admits an entropy-balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. Guided by this theory, we implement an entropy-triggered retraining policy using an exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) control statistic applied to a streaming kernel density estimator of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We evaluate this approach across multiple nonstationary data streams. In synthetic, financial, and web-traffic domains, entropy-based retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to frequent retraining while reducing retraining frequency by one to two orders of magnitude. However, in a challenging biomedical ECG setting, the entropy-based trigger underperforms the maximum-frequency baseline, highlighting limitations of feature-space entropy monitoring under complex label-conditional drift.",

PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.",

    "summary": "Wearable devices enable continuous, population-scale monitoring of physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), creating new opportunities for data-driven clinical assessment. Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these \"what-if\" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.",

    "summary": "Traffic flow prediction is a typical spatio-temporal prediction problem and has a wide range of applications. The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.",

When dynamics are unknown, data-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing methods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for unknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian framework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated using output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting samples are used to construct a barrier certificate through a sum-of-squares program. Probabilistic guarantees for its validity with respect to the true, unknown system are obtained by testing on an additional set of posterior samples. The approach and its probabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.",

    "summary": "The World Wide Web thrives on intelligent services that rely on accurate time series classification, which has recently witnessed significant progress driven by advances in deep learning. However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that DualCD effectively improves performance in domain incremental scenarios. We summarize our rich experiments into a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate research in domain incremental time series classification.",

    "summary": "Training large language models (LLMs) models directly in low-precision offers a way to address computational costs by improving both throughput and energy efficiency. For those purposes, NVIDIA's recent Blackwell architecture facilitates very low-precision operations using FP4 variants. Yet, current algorithms for training LLMs in FP4 precision face significant accuracy degradation and often rely on mixed-precision fallbacks. In this paper, we investigate hardware-supported FP4 training and introduce a new approach for accurate, end-to-end FP4 training with all the major computations (i.e., linear layers) in low precision. Through extensive evaluations on Llama-type models, we reveal a new low-precision scaling law that quantifies performance trade-offs across bit-widths and training setups. Guided by this investigation, we design an \"optimal\" technique in terms of accuracy-vs-computation, called Quartet. We implement Quartet using optimized CUDA kernels tailored for Blackwell, demonstrating that fully FP4-based training is a competitive alternative to FP16 half-precision and to FP8 training.

    "title": "Spectral Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes",
    "summary": "Neural Processes (NPs) are meta-learning models that learn to map sets of observations to approximations of the corresponding posterior predictive distributions. By accommodating variable-sized, unstructured collections of observations and enabling probabilistic predictions at arbitrary query points, NPs provide a flexible framework for modeling functions over continuous domains. Since their introduction, numerous variants have emerged; however, early formulations shared a fundamental limitation: they compressed the observed data into finite-dimensional global representations via aggregation operations such as mean pooling. This strategy induces an intrinsic mismatch with the infinite-dimensional nature of the stochastic processes that NPs intend to model. Convolutional conditional neural processes (ConvCNPs) address this limitation by constructing infinite-dimensional functional embeddings processed through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enforce translation equivariance. Yet CNNs with local spatial kernels struggle to capture long-range dependencies without resorting to large kernels, which impose significant computational costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose spectral ConvCNPs (SConvCNPs), which perform global convolution in the frequency domain. Inspired by Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs), our approach directly parameterizes convolution kernels in the frequency domain, leveraging the relatively compact yet global Fourier representation of many natural signals. We validate the effectiveness of SConvCNPs on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating how ideas from operator learning can advance the capabilities of NPs.",

Solutions of lower functional complexity are known to produce abstractions that generalise more effectively and are more robust to input perturbations. In complex hypothesis spaces, inductive biases make such solutions learnable by shaping the loss geometry during optimisation. In a HEP classification task, we show that a soft symmetry respecting inductive bias creates approximate degeneracies in the loss, which we identify as pseudo-Goldstone modes. We quantify functional complexity using metrics derived from first principles Hessian analysis and via compressibility. Our results demonstrate that solutions of lower complexity give rise to abstractions that are more generalisable, robust, and efficiently distillable.",

However, SSCC often suffers from a pronounced cliff effect in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, where residual bit errors after channel decoding can catastrophically break lossless source decoding, especially for Arithmetic Coding (AC) driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper proposes a receiver-side In-Context Decoding (ICD) framework that enhances SSCC robustness without modifying the transmitter. ICD leverages an Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) to obtain bit-wise reliability for the decoded information bits. Based on the context-consistent bitstream, ICD constructs a confidence-ranked candidate pool via reliability-guided bit flipping, samples a compact yet diverse subset of candidates, and applies an LLM-based arithmetic decoder to obtain both reconstructions and sequence-level log-likelihoods. A reliability-likelihood fusion rule then selects the final output. We further provide theoretical guarantees on the stability and convergence of the proposed sampling procedure. Extensive experiments over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate consistent gains compared with conventional SSCC baselines and representative Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes.",

A backbone DNN is pre-trained on synthetic OFDM signals incorporating parametric hardware distortions (e.g., phase noise, IQ imbalance), enabling generalized feature learning without costly cross-device data collection. Subsequently, only the regression layers are fine-tuned using $1,000$ real frames per target device, preserving hardware-agnostic knowledge while adapting to device-specific impairments. Experiments across three SDR families (USRP B210, USRP N210, HackRF One) achieve $30\\times$ BER reduction compared to conventional CP-based methods under indoor multipath conditions. The framework bridges the simulation-to-reality gap for robust CFO estimation, enabling cost-effective deployment in heterogeneous wireless systems.",

We here circumvent these negative results by constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant degree over classical neural networks -- including state-of-the-art models, such as Transformers -- in performing a classical sequence modeling task. This construction is also computationally efficient, as each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs only has constant gate complexity. We show that contextuality -- informally, a quantitative notion of semantic ambiguity -- is the source of the expressivity separation, suggesting that other learning tasks with this property may be a natural setting for the use of quantum learning algorithms.",

    "summary": "Dynamic control of soft continuum robots (SCRs) holds great potential for expanding their applications, but remains a challenging problem due to the high computational demands of accurate dynamic models. While data-driven approaches like Koopman-operator-based methods have been proposed, they typically lack adaptability and cannot reconstruct the full robot shape, limiting their applicability. This work introduces a real-time-capable nonlinear model-predictive control (MPC) framework for SCRs based on a domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) with adaptable bending stiffness. The DD-PINN serves as a surrogate for the dynamic Cosserat rod model with a speed-up factor of 44000. It is also used within an unscented Kalman filter for estimating the model states and bending compliance from end-effector position measurements. We implement a nonlinear evolutionary MPC running at 70 Hz on the GPU. In simulation, it demonstrates accurate tracking of dynamic trajectories and setpoint control with end-effector position errors below 3 mm (2.3% of the actuator's length). In real-world experiments, the controller achieves similar accuracy and accelerations up to 3.55 m/s2.",

VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications.

    "summary": "Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is the dominant paradigm for private training, but its fundamental limitations under worst-case adversarial privacy definitions remain poorly understood. We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $κ$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $κ$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $σ$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy\n  $σ\\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\ln M}}$ $\\quad\\text{or}\\quad$ $κ\\ge\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\!\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4π\\ln M}}\\right)$,\n  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \\to \\infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.",

There is an abundance of different complexes to choose from, with Čech, Rips, alpha, and witness complexes being popular choices. In this manuscript, we build a novel type of geometrically informed simplicial complex, called a Rips-type ellipsoid complex. This complex is based on the idea that ellipsoids aligned with tangent directions better approximate the data compared to conventional (Euclidean) balls centered at sample points, as used in the construction of Rips and Alpha complexes. We use Principal Component Analysis to estimate tangent spaces directly from samples and present an algorithm for computing Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes, i.e., topological descriptors based on Rips-type ellipsoid complexes. Additionally, we show that the ellipsoid barcodes depend continuously on the input data so that small perturbations of a k-generic point cloud lead to proportionally small changes in the resulting ellipsoid barcodes. This provides a theoretical guarantee analogous, if somewhat weaker, to the classical stability results for Rips and Čech filtrations. We also conduct extensive experiments and compare Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes with standard Rips barcodes. Our findings indicate that Rips-type ellipsoid complexes are particularly effective for estimating the homology of manifolds and spaces with bottlenecks from samples. In particular, the persistence intervals corresponding to ground-truth topological features are longer compared to those obtained using the Rips complex of the data. Furthermore, Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes lead to better classification results in sparsely sampled point clouds. Finally, we demonstrate that Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes outperform Rips barcodes in classification tasks.",

Its computation relies on a mild norm-boundedness assumption on the unknown function and the noise, returning the worst-case function realization within the hypothesis class at an arbitrary query input location. The value of this function is shown to be given in terms of the posterior mean and covariance of a Gaussian process for an optimal choice of the measurement noise covariance.

    "summary": "High-dimensional data often exhibit dependencies among variables that violate the isotropic-noise assumption under which principal component analysis (PCA) is optimal. For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.",

While conceptually related, these tasks are typically tackled with isolated solutions that often suffer from ambiguous importance scores or prohibitive computational costs.\n  In this paper, we propose ShuffleGate, a unified and interpretable mechanism that estimates component importance by measuring the model's sensitivity to information loss. Unlike conventional gating that learns relative weights, ShuffleGate introduces a batch-wise shuffling strategy to effectively erase information in an end-to-end differentiable manner. This paradigm shift yields naturally polarized importance distributions, bridging the long-standing \"search-retrain gap\" and distinguishing essential signals from noise without complex threshold tuning.\n  ShuffleGate provides a unified solution across granularities. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on feature and dimension selection tasks. Furthermore, to demonstrate its extreme scalability and precision, we extend ShuffleGate to evaluate fine-grained embedding entries. Experiments show it can identify and prune 99.9% of redundant embedding parameters on the Criteo dataset while maintaining competitive AUC, verifying its robustness in massive search spaces. Finally, the method has been successfully deployed in a top-tier industrial video recommendation platform. By compressing the concatenated input dimension from over 10,000 to 1,000+, it achieved a 91% increase in training throughput while serving billions of daily requests without performance degradation.",

Global climate indices, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas.

    "title": "Bias in the Shadows: Explore Shortcuts in Encrypted Network Traffic Classification",
    "summary": "Pre-trained models operating directly on raw bytes have achieved promising performance in encrypted network traffic classification (NTC), but often suffer from shortcut learning-relying on spurious correlations that fail to generalize to real-world data. Existing solutions heavily rely on model-specific interpretation techniques, which lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios.\n  In this paper, we propose BiasSeeker, the first semi-automated framework that is both model-agnostic and data-driven for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic. By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information.\n  We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.",

    "summary": "Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, a central problem in modern marketing, is characterized by a unique zero-inflated and long-tail data distribution. This distribution presents two fundamental challenges: (1) the vast majority of low-to-medium value users numerically overwhelm the small but critically important segment of high-value \"whale\" users, and (2) significant value heterogeneity exists even within the low-to-medium value user base. Common approaches either rely on rigid statistical assumptions or attempt to decouple ranking and regression using ordered buckets; however, they often enforce ordinality through loss-based constraints rather than inherent architectural design, failing to balance global accuracy with high-value precision. To address this gap, we propose \\textbf{C}onditional \\textbf{C}ascaded \\textbf{O}rdinal-\\textbf{R}esidual Networks \\textbf{(CC-OR-Net)}, a novel unified framework that achieves a more robust decoupling through \\textbf{structural decomposition}, where ranking is architecturally guaranteed. CC-OR-Net integrates three specialized components: a \\textit{structural ordinal decomposition module} for robust ranking, an \\textit{intra-bucket residual module} for fine-grained regression, and a \\textit{targeted high-value augmentation module} for precision on top-tier users. Evaluated on real-world datasets with over 300M users, CC-OR-Net achieves a superior trade-off across all key business metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in creating a holistic and commercially valuable LTV prediction solution.",

    "summary": "Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training methods for large language models have advanced rapidly, yet their design has largely been guided by heuristics rather than systematic theoretical principles. This gap limits our understanding of the properties of the gradient estimators and the associated optimization algorithms, thereby constraining opportunities to improve training stability and overall performance. In this work, we provide a unified theoretical framework that characterizes the statistical properties of commonly used policy-gradient estimators under mild assumptions. Our analysis establishes unbiasedness, derives exact variance expressions, and yields an optimization-loss upper bound that enables principled reasoning about learning dynamics. Building on these results, we prove convergence guarantees and derive an adaptive learning-rate schedule governed by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gradients. We further show that the variance-optimal baseline is a gradient-weighted estimator, offering a new principle for variance reduction and naturally enhancing stability beyond existing methods. These insights motivate Optimal Baseline and Learning-Rate Policy Optimization (OBLR-PO), an algorithm that jointly adapts learning rates and baselines in a theoretically grounded manner. Experiments on Qwen3-4B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base demonstrate consistent gains over existing policy optimization methods, validating that our theoretical contributions translate into practical improvements in large-scale post-training.",

    "summary": "Heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge for many real-world large-scale decision-making problems but remains largely understudied. In this paper, we study the fully heterogeneous setting of a prominent class of such problems, known as weakly-coupled Markov decision processes (WCMDPs). Each WCMDP consists of $N$ arms (or subproblems), which have distinct model parameters in the fully heterogeneous setting, leading to the curse of dimensionality when $N$ is large. We show that, under mild assumptions, an efficiently computable policy achieves an $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in the long-run average reward per arm for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs as $N$ becomes large. This is the first asymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous average-reward WCMDPs. Our main technical innovation is the construction of projection-based Lyapunov functions that certify the convergence of rewards and costs to an optimal region, even under full heterogeneity.",

    "summary": "Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \\emph{normalized} energy (log probability) models that is inspired by diffusion generative models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective, ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an energy network with this \\emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64 dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our energy model \\emph{strongly generalizes}: log probabilities estimated with two networks trained on non-overlapping data subsets are nearly identical. Finally, we demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local neighborhoods vary substantially depending on image content, in contrast with conventional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a low-dimensional manifold.",

Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations.

    "summary": "Integrating Large AI Models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks is a key enabler of the AI-Native Air Interface (AI-AI), where protocol intelligence must scale beyond handcrafted logic. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first standards-compliant emulation of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer using a decoder-only LAM (LLAMA-class) fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a multi-vendor corpus of real-world traces spanning both 5G and 4G systems. We treat RRC as a domain-specific language and construct a segmentation-safe, question-answer (Question-and-Answer (QA)) dataset that preserves Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) structure through linearization prior to Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization. The proposed approach combines parameter-efficient adaptation with schema-bounded prompting to ensure syntactic and procedural fidelity. Evaluation introduces a standards-aware triad -- ASN.1 conformance, field-level coverage analysis, and uplink-to-downlink state-machine checks -- alongside semantic similarity and latency profiling across 120 configurations. On 30k 5G request-response pairs plus an additional 4.8k QA turns from 4G sessions, our 8B model achieves a median cosine similarity of 0.97, a 61% relative gain over a zero-shot baseline, while sustaining high conformance rates. These results demonstrate that LAMs, when augmented with protocol-aware reasoning, can directly orchestrate control-plane procedures, laying the foundation for the future Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native Radio Access Network (RAN).",

Although the field has witnessed remarkable advances over the past few years, it remains statistically and computationally challenging to learn a single (point estimate) DAG from data, let alone provide uncertainty quantification. We address the difficult task of quantifying graph uncertainty by developing a Bayesian variational inference framework based on novel, provably valid distributions that have support directly on the space of sparse DAGs. These distributions, which we use to define our prior and variational posterior, are induced by a projection operation that maps an arbitrary continuous distribution onto the space of sparse weighted acyclic adjacency matrices. While this projection is combinatorial, it can be solved efficiently using recent continuous reformulations of acyclicity constraints. We empirically demonstrate that our method, ProDAG, can outperform state-of-the-art alternatives in both accuracy and uncertainty quantification.",

As machine learning becomes more widespread, it is increasingly imperative to identify and correct mislabeling to develop more powerful models. In this work, we motivate and describe Adaptive Label Error Detection (ALED), a novel method of detecting mislabeling. ALED extracts an intermediate feature space from a deep convolutional neural network, denoises the features, models the reduced manifold of each class with a multidimensional Gaussian distribution, and performs a simple likelihood ratio test to identify mislabeled samples. We show that ALED has markedly increased sensitivity, without compromising precision, compared to established label error detection methods, on multiple medical imaging datasets. We demonstrate an example where fine-tuning a neural network on corrected data results in a 33.8% decrease in test set errors, providing strong benefits to end users.

Through a detailed comparative analysis, we highlight key improvements across three main retrieval tasks: known-item search, question answering, and ad-hoc search. Our analysis identifies trends such as the widespread adoption of embedding-based retrieval methods (e.g., CLIP, BLIP), increased integration of large language models (LLMs) for conversational retrieval, and continued innovation in multimodal and collaborative search interfaces. We further discuss how specific retrieval techniques and user interface (UI) designs have impacted system performance, emphasizing the importance of balancing retrieval complexity with usability. Our findings indicate that embedding-driven approaches combined with LLMs show promise for lifelog retrieval systems. Likewise, improving UI design can enhance usability and efficiency. Additionally, we recommend reconsidering multi-instance system evaluations within the expert track to better manage variability in user familiarity and configuration effectiveness.",

Decomposing the covariant derivative in terms of diagonal multiple of the identity, anti-symmetric, and trace-less symmetric components, we can define the standard operators used for vector field processing including the Hodge Laplacian energy, Connection Laplacian energy, and Killing energy. Additionally, the ability to perform point-wise evaluation of the covariant derivative also makes it possible for us to define the Lie bracket.",

    "summary": "As a well-known community detection algorithm, Leiden has been widely used in various scenarios such as large language model generation (e.g., Graph-RAG), anomaly detection, and biological analysis. In these scenarios, the graphs are often large and dynamic, where vertices and edges are inserted and deleted frequently, so it is costly to obtain the updated communities by Leiden from scratch when the graph has changed. Recently, one work has attempted to study how to maintain Leiden communities in the dynamic graph, but it lacks a detailed theoretical analysis, and its algorithms are inefficient for large graphs. To address these issues, in this paper, we first theoretically show that the existing algorithms are relatively unbounded via the boundedness analysis (a powerful tool for analyzing incremental algorithms on dynamic graphs), and also analyze the memberships of vertices in communities when the graph changes. Based on theoretical analysis, we develop a novel efficient maintenance algorithm, called Hierarchical Incremental Tree Leiden (HIT-Leiden), which effectively reduces the range of affected vertices by maintaining the connected components and hierarchical community structures. Comprehensive experiments in various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HIT-Leiden. In particular, it achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude over existing methods.",

    "summary": "This paper presents the FS-Planner, a fast graph-search planner based on a modified Lazy Theta* algorithm that exploits the analytical properties of Euclidean Distance Fields (EDFs). We introduce a new cost function that integrates an EDF-based term proven to satisfy the triangle inequality, enabling efficient parent selection and reducing computation time while generating safe paths with smaller heading variations. We also derive an analytic approximation of the EDF integral along a segment and analyze the influence of the line-of-sight limit on the approximation error, motivating the use of a bounded visibility range. Furthermore, we propose a gradient-based neighbour-selection mechanism that decreases the number of explored nodes and improves computational performance without degrading safety or path quality. The FS-Planner produces safe paths with small heading changes without requiring the use of post-processing methods. Extensive experiments and comparisons in challenging 3D indoor simulation environments, complemented by tests in real-world outdoor environments, are used to evaluate and validate the FS-Planner. The results show consistent improvements in computation time, exploration efficiency, safety, and smoothness in a geometric sense compared with baseline heuristic planners, while maintaining sub-optimality within acceptable bounds. Finally, the proposed EDF-based cost formulation is orthogonal to the underlying search method and can be incorporated into other planning paradigms.",

    "summary": "We present a novel approach to enhance the performance of sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) in constrained optimization by leveraging products of experts. Our methodology divides the main problem into two components: one focused on optimality and the other on feasibility. By combining the solutions from each component, represented as distributions, we apply products of experts to implement a project-then-sample strategy. In this strategy, the optimality distribution is projected into the feasible area, allowing for more efficient sampling. This approach contrasts with the traditional sample-then-project and naive sample-then-reject method, leading to more diverse exploration and reducing the accumulation of samples on the boundaries. We demonstrate an effective implementation of this principle using a tensor train-based distribution model, which is characterized by its non-parametric nature, ease of combination with other distributions at the task level, and straightforward sampling technique. We adapt existing tensor train models to suit this purpose and validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments in various tasks, including obstacle avoidance, non-prehensile manipulation, and tasks involving staying in a restricted volume. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms known baselines, providing strong empirical support for its effectiveness.

In SF-GVF, paths should follow a parametric definition. This feature makes using Bezier's curves attractive to define the robot's desired patch. The curvature-varying speed setpoint, combined with the guidance algorithm, eases the convergence to the path when physical restrictions exist, such as minimal turning radius or maximal lateral acceleration. We provide theoretical results, simulations, and outdoor experiments using a WMR platform assembled with off-the-shelf components.",

    "title": "Online identification of nonlinear time-varying systems with uncertain information",
    "summary": "Digital twins (DTs), serving as the core enablers for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of complex cyber-physical systems, impose critical requirements on their virtual models: high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability. However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. These conditions also function as real-time monitors for data utility, enhancing algorithmic robustness. Additionally, a rigorous convergence analysis is provided, demonstrating the convergence of parameter estimates under persistent excitation conditions. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.",

    "summary": "Running up stairs is effortless for humans but remains extremely challenging for humanoid robots due to the simultaneous requirements of high agility and strict stability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can generate dynamic locomotion, yet implicit stability rewards and heavy reliance on task-specific reward shaping tend to result in unsafe behaviors, especially on stairs; conversely, model-based foothold planners encode contact feasibility and stability structure, but enforcing their hard constraints often induces conservative motion that limits speed. We present FastStair, a planner-guided, multi-stage learning framework that reconciles these complementary strengths to achieve fast and stable stair ascent. FastStair integrates a parallel model-based foothold planner into the RL training loop to bias exploration toward dynamically feasible contacts and to pretrain a safety-focused base policy. To mitigate planner-induced conservatism and the discrepancy between low- and high-speed action distributions, the base policy was fine-tuned into speed-specialized experts and then integrated via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable smooth operation across the full commanded-speed range. We deploy the resulting controller on the Oli humanoid robot, achieving stable stair ascent at commanded speeds up to 1.65 m/s and traversing a 33-step spiral staircase (17 cm rise per step) in 12 s, demonstrating robust high-speed performance on long staircases. Notably, the proposed approach served as the champion solution in the Canton Tower Robot Run Up Competition.",

    "title": "CHORAL: Traversal-Aware Planning for Safe and Efficient Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Routing",
    "summary": "Monitoring large, unknown, and complex environments with autonomous robots poses significant navigation challenges, where deploying teams of heterogeneous robots with complementary capabilities can substantially improve both mission performance and feasibility. However, effectively modeling how different robotic platforms interact with the environment requires rich, semantic scene understanding. Despite this, existing approaches often assume homogeneous robot teams or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing. Consequently, scene understanding is not fully integrated into routing decisions, limiting their ability to adapt to the environment and to leverage each robot's strengths. In this paper, we propose an integrated semantic-aware framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots. Starting from a reconnaissance flight, we build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models and use it to identify regions requiring closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform to reach them. These are then incorporated into a heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation that jointly assigns inspection tasks and computes robot trajectories. Experiments in simulation and in a real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning safer and more efficient routes by explicitly accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities. We release our framework, CHORAL, as open source to support reproducibility and deployment of diverse robot teams.",

    "title": "Learning Quadrotor Control From Visual Features Using Differentiable Simulation",
    "summary": "The sample inefficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) remains a significant challenge in robotics. RL requires large-scale simulation and can still cause long training times, slowing research and innovation. This issue is particularly pronounced in vision-based control tasks where reliable state estimates are not accessible. Differentiable simulation offers an alternative by enabling gradient back-propagation through the dynamics model, providing low-variance analytical policy gradients and, hence, higher sample efficiency. However, its usage for real-world robotic tasks has yet been limited. This work demonstrates the great potential of differentiable simulation for learning quadrotor control. We show that training in differentiable simulation significantly outperforms model-free RL in terms of both sample efficiency and training time, allowing a policy to learn to recover a quadrotor in seconds when providing vehicle states and in minutes when relying solely on visual features. The key to our success is two-fold. First, the use of a simple surrogate model for gradient computation greatly accelerates training without sacrificing control performance. Second, combining state representation learning with policy learning enhances convergence speed in tasks where only visual features are observable. These findings highlight the potential of differentiable simulation for real-world robotics and offer a compelling alternative to conventional RL approaches.",

    "summary": "Tactile sensors are breaking into the field of robotics to provide direct information related to contact surfaces, including contact events, slip events and even texture identification. These events are especially important for robotic hand designs, including prosthetics, as they can greatly improve grasp stability. Most presently published robotic hand designs, however, implement them in vastly different densities and layouts on the hand surface, often reserving the majority of the available space. We used simulations to evaluate 6 different tactile sensor configurations with different densities and layouts, based on their impact on reinforcement learning. Our two-setup system allows for robust results that are not dependent on the use of a given physics simulator, robotic hand model or machine learning algorithm. Our results show setup-specific, as well as generalized effects across the 6 sensorized simulations, and we identify one configuration as consistently yielding the best performance across both setups. These results could help future research aimed at robotic hand designs, including prostheses.",

    "summary": "This work addresses the challenge of safe and efficient mobile robot navigation in complex dynamic environments with concave moving obstacles. Reactive safe controllers like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) design obstacle avoidance strategies based only on the current states of the obstacles, risking future collisions. To alleviate this problem, we use Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks trained with energy-based learning. The learned barrier functions are then fed into quadratic programs using modulated CBFs (MCBFs), a local-minimum-free version of CBFs, to achieve safe and efficient navigation. The proposed framework makes two key contributions. First, it develops a prediction-to-barrier function online learning pipeline. Second, it introduces an autonomous parameter tuning algorithm that adapts MCBFs to deforming, prediction-based barrier functions. The framework is evaluated in both simulations and real-world experiments, consistently outperforming baselines and demonstrating superior safety and efficiency in crowded dynamic environments.",

The AI module learns terrain-to-perturbation mappings from IMU, vision, and depth sensors, enabling proactive compensation rather than reactive correction. This intelligence is embedded into a three-layer control architecture: path planning, predictive chassis-manipulator coordination, and precision hardware execution. Through outdoor experiments on terrain with slopes and surface irregularities, we demonstrate sub-centimeter printing accuracy while maintaining full platform mobility. This AI-hardware integration establishes a practical foundation for autonomous construction in unstructured environments.",

    "summary": "Multi-robot systems can greatly enhance efficiency through coordination and collaboration, yet in practice, full-time communication is rarely available and interactions are constrained to close-range exchanges. Existing methods either maintain all-time connectivity, rely on fixed schedules, or adopt pairwise protocols, but none adapt effectively to dynamic spatio-temporal task distributions under limited communication, resulting in suboptimal coordination. To address this gap, we propose CoCoPlan, a unified framework that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and team-wise intermittent communication. Our approach integrates a branch-and-bound architecture that jointly encodes task assignments and communication events, an adaptive objective function that balances task efficiency against communication latency, and a communication event optimization module that strategically determines when, where and how the global connectivity should be re-established. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a 22.4% higher task completion rate, reducing communication overhead by 58.6%, and improving the scalability by supporting up to 100 robots in dynamic environments. Hardware experiments include the complex 2D office environment and large-scale 3D disaster-response scenario.",
