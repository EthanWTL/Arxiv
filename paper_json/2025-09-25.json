In this paper, we present a method by which\nbacktrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this\ndifficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed\nbacktracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful\ncontrol information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by\nearlier approaches.",

We describe in\ndetail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau\nsearch. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems,\nthere is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of\nsatisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make\ndetailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the\naverage gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score\nand average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by\nshowing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis.\nThis work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to\nimprove understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.",

    "summary": "As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning\nprocedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut\npredicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be\nlearned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning\nsystems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of\na space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to\ngenerate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and\nthen make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of\nlearning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to\nbe a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate\nthe difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually\ncaused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion,\nthe analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that\nlearning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be\nrestricted to purely declarative logic languages.",

Second, we allow to express inclusion\nstatements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular\ncase. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction\nservices (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a\nsound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge\nbases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems.

In addition to the minimum description length principle, other\nbackground knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more\nappropriate substructures.

If we are reasoning\nabout a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all\npossible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB,\nand compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of\nbelief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show\nthat when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary\npredicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N\ngrows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can\nuse a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result\nis in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence,\nbut is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the\nlimitations on its scope.

This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique\nin which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output\nrepresentation. We show that these output representations improve the\ngeneralization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of\nmulticlass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust\nwith respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of\ndistributed representations to particular classes, and the application of\noverfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we\nshow that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can\nprovide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results\ndemonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method\nfor improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass\nproblems.",

    "summary": "The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan\ndebugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or\nrepairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a\ndomain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound,\ncomplete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the\nliterature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of\npartial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from\nnode to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a\nlibrary plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for\nthe search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same\nrefinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract\nconstraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that\nthe adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its\nsystematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any\nparts of the graph.",

    "summary": "Temporal difference (TD) methods constitute a class of methods for learning\npredictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency\nfactor lambda. Currently the most important application of these methods is to\ntemporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of\nTD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general\nimplementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement\nlearning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional\napproach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both\ninefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences)\nprocedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates\nTD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used\nwith arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is\nderived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far.\nEncouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda\n&gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning\nspeedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.",

There are two challenges that theory revision and other\ntheory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for\nthe initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the\noriginal representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more\naccurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky,\ncumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a\ncoarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory.

As a\nresult, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI,\nhindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded\noptimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a\nsolution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture\nand the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property\nfor a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time\nenvironments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated\nmail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded\noptimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical\ncomplexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs\nthat are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO\nprograms can be used as building blocks for more complex systems.

    "title": "Flexibly Instructable Agents",
    "summary": "This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive\ntutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a\nflexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an\ninstructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in\nwhatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the\nagent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of\ninstructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves\nsuch learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It\ncombines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each\ninstruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete\nexplanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar\nthat learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from\ninteractive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key\nrequirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous\nsystems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point;\n(2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to\na hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance,\nconditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class\nof knowledge it uses to perform tasks.",

    "summary": "In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and\nthe usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently\nthere has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in\nmachine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform\ngeneralization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of\nimplication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique\nto compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under\nimplication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate\nfor learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is\nthe basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between\nclauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of\nimplication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show\nthat for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general\ngeneralization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce\ngeneralizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under\ntheta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover\nwe show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete\nexpansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the\nclause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion.",

At the core of the system are algorithms for\ndetermining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding\none or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two\nimportant algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a\nbacktracking algorithm.

Clustering\nsystems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality\nand the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the\nsearch strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but\nbe computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both\nways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs\na `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative\noptimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings.\nGiven this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial\nclusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative\noptimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search\nof a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative\noptimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been\nconstructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific\ncriteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic\nperformance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over\ncompleted patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this\nperformance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by\nsupervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical\nclusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis.

    "summary": "Although most scheduling problems are NP-hard, domain specific techniques\nperform well in practice but are quite expensive to construct. In adaptive\nproblem-solving solving, domain specific knowledge is acquired automatically\nfor a general problem solver with a flexible control architecture. In this\napproach, a learning system explores a space of possible heuristic methods for\none well-suited to the eccentricities of the given domain and problem\ndistribution. In this article, we discuss an application of the approach to\nscheduling satellite communications. Using problem distributions based on\nactual mission requirements, our approach identifies strategies that not only\ndecrease the amount of CPU time required to produce schedules, but also\nincrease the percentage of problems that are solvable within computational\nresource limitations.",

    "summary": "A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is that there is no\nuncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions\nunder which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully\npredictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e.,\nplans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In\nthis paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and\nconstruction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order\ncontingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the\nagent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The\ndecision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are\nplanned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes\nthe process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The\nexplicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to\nthe problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions\nsuch as the use of different decision-making procedures.",

Based on the\nresearch in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems,\nnonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have\nidentified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning\norganizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that\nperceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure\nand behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to\nperform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical\nmethods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to\nunify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program\nwritten in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous\nfield and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level\ndescriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a\nmulti-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by\nforming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of\ngeneric operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to\nperform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and\nsuccessively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the\nneighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To\nillustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three\nimplemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the\nspatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of\ncommonly used routines.",

The first two techniques are\naimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is\nbased on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to\nselect plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero\ncommitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO\nprioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator\nparameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from\nthe definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a\npolynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the\noperator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter\ndomains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove\nspurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP,\nour improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors\nranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial\nfor the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest\nimprovements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave\nspeedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the\ndefault UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy.

    "summary": "Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse\nstructure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than\nstructural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or\nsentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit\ndiscourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and\nplan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for\nclassifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning\nprograms (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets\nof pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine\nlearning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the\ngeneration of classification models, but also for improving upon previous\nresults. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the\nliterature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain\nnew linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to\nautomatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively\nanalyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data.\nFinally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and\nflexible than manual methods.",

We define State\nOriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient\nconditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an\naltered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of\njoint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict\nresolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial\ncooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in\nfundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A\nUnified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types\nof encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a\npartial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents'\ngoals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational\nagreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where\nagents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents.\nFirst we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we\nanalyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase\ntheir utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents' goals (and\ntherefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to\ntheir goals is private information.

    "summary": "Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have\nbeen based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and\nsymbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or\nconnectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use\na relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic\ncomponent. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning\nrobust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a\nflat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for\nanalyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather\nthan using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist\nanalysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language\nprocessing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of\nconnectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the\nSCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In\nthis paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the\nflat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer,\nand a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of\nnoisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat\nrepresentations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language\nthan deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the\nfault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a\nflat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an\noverall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.",

    "summary": "We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks,\nwhich consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic\nexpression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple\nevaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a\nnumber, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the\nanswer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest.\nIt appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms\nfor exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using\nclustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a\nQ-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the\ninference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation\nalgorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a\nstandard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended\nvalue of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to\nutilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed\nframework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different\nsoftware and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation\nalgorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes:\nsimple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex\noptimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning\nand computation-caching.",

We show\nthat for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with\nthe delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size,\nand will do so without excessive computational overhead.

Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains\nobstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter\ndiffering, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment.\nFurthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities\nor discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and\ncommunication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting\nindividual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their\ninflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their\ndomain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key\nto such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of\nteamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination\nand communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models\nenable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing\nconsistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork,\ncalled STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions\n(Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a\n(partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel\nGrosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members\nmonitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team\nas necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM\nensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate\nsensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's\napplication in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical\nresults.",

It replaces the detailed\nand lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous\nplanning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve\nperformance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance\nimprovements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem\nsimilarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning\neffort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP\ndepends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes\nthe design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner\nDERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating\nexplanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from\nthe retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine\njudgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision\nhas been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library,\nthrough the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as\nsingle goal subproblems.

The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a\nprior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his\nreward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action\nto every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are\nconsidered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able\nto observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the\nother -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is\nthe reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable\nprocesses, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result\nrefers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We\nprove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the\ncompetitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high\nprobability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence.

Based on this finding, we present both a new generic\napproach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically\nimproving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These\napproaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently\nproposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding.\nEmpirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that\nbidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with\nlimited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search\nappears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding\nunidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a\nsearch strategy that was long neglected.

More fundamentally, these schemes are not\ninductive, in that they may lose in a single update any positive properties of\nthe represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this\npaper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn\napproximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very\nefficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is\nrepresented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the\nupper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and\nsimilarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which\nenables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when\nthe underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn\nformula by a clause.

    "title": "Synthesizing Customized Planners from Specifications",
    "summary": "Existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial intelligence fall into two\ncategories -- domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent\napproaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very\nefficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be\n(re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the\ndomain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these\napproaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the\nknowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis\ntools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture\ncalled CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used\nto derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a\ndeclarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific\nto a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive\ndomain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative\ntheory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach\nby generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space\nrefinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform\nclassical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP,\nKambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will\ncontrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional\nmethods for customizing domain independent planners.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting\nfor machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing\ncontingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number\nof records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain\nassumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of\nthe number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero\nentries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the\nADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for\nthis structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically\ndemonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large\nreal-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates\nmemory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be\ndeduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near\nits leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net\nstructure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection\nalgorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree\nmethods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the\npossible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the\nmerits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as\nkd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.",

The\ntheory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the\ntheory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training\nexamples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions\nare made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is\nto determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching\nproblem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain\ntheories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of\ndetermining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of\nwhat revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining\nstability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that\nrevisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification\nof examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification\nof examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used\nto determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching\nalgorithms.",

Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence\nknown as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard\nvariations.

Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were basic operators.\nThe major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros\nthat are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the\nsearch space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro\nlearning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros.\nThis paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros.\nSolvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The\nonly macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local\nminimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several\ndomains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles.

Rather than\nreasoning about the world it is planning for, SYNERGY uses artificial\nselection, recombination and fitness measure to generate linear plans that\nsolve conjunctive goals. We ran SYNERGY on several domains (e.g., the briefcase\nproblem and a few variants of the robot navigation problem), and the\nexperimental results show that our planner is capable of handling problem\ninstances that are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the ones solved\nby UCPOP.

Examples\nare the evaluation of Boolean CQs and query containment. These problems were\nshown tractable for conjunctive queries of bounded treewidth and of bounded\ndegree of cyclicity. The so far most general concept of nearly acyclic queries\nwas the notion of queries of bounded query-width introduced by Chekuri and\nRajaraman (1997). While CQs of bounded query width are tractable, it remained\nunclear whether such queries are efficiently recognizable. Chekuri and\nRajaraman stated as an open problem whether for each constant k it can be\ndetermined in polynomial time if a query has query width less than or equal to\nk. We give a negative answer by proving this problem NP-complete (specifically,\nfor k=4). In order to circumvent this difficulty, we introduce the new concept\nof hypertree decomposition of a query and the corresponding notion of hypertree\nwidth. We prove: (a) for each k, the class of queries with query width bounded\nby k is properly contained in the class of queries whose hypertree width is\nbounded by k; (b) unlike query width, constant hypertree-width is efficiently\nrecognizable; (c) Boolean queries of constant hypertree width can be\nefficiently evaluated.",

    "summary": "Given a set of numbers, the balanced partioning problem is to divide them\ninto two subsets, so that the sum of the numbers in each subset are as nearly\nequal as possible, subject to the constraint that the cardinalities of the\nsubsets be within one of each other. We combine the balanced largest\ndifferencing method (BLDM) and Korf's complete Karmarkar-Karp algorithm to get\na new algorithm that optimally solves the balanced partitioning problem. For\nnumbers with twelve significant digits or less, the algorithm can optimally\nsolve balanced partioning problems of arbitrary size in practice. For numbers\nwith greater precision, it first returns the BLDM solution, then continues to\nfind better solutions as time allows.",

    "summary": "The study of belief change has been an active area in philosophy and AI. In\nrecent years two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief\nupdate, have been studied in detail. In a companion paper (Friedman & Halpern,\n1997), we introduce a new framework to model belief change. This framework\ncombines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility,\nallowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show\nhow belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This\nallows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better\nunderstand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno\nand Mendelzon's notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991a) depends on\nseveral strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial\nintelligence. Finally, our analysis allow us to identify a notion of minimal\nchange that underlies a broad range of belief change operations including\nrevision and update.",

How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated\nsolely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but\nother meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese\nfrom a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched:\nSymbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic\nrepresentations of two kinds: (1) \"iconic representations,\" which are analogs\nof the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2)\n\"categorical representations,\" which are learned and innate feature-detectors\nthat pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their\nsensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event\ncategories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical\nrepresentations. Higher-order (3) \"symbolic representations,\" grounded in these\nelementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership\nrelations (e.g., \"An X is a Y that is Z\").",

It provides proofs that various problems of probabilistic\ndisambiguation are NP-Complete under instances of these performance-models, and\nit argues that none of these models accounts for attractive efficiency\nproperties of human language processing in limited domains, e.g. that frequent\ninputs are usually processed faster than infrequent ones. The central\nhypothesis of this dissertation is that these shortcomings can be eliminated by\nspecializing the performance-models to the limited domains. The dissertation\naddresses \"grammar and model specialization\" and presents a new framework, the\nAmbiguity-Reduction Specialization (ARS) framework, that formulates the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for successful specialization. The\nframework is instantiated into specialization algorithms and applied to\nspecializing DOP. Novelties of these learning algorithms are 1) they limit the\nhypotheses-space to include only \"safe\" models, 2) are expressed as constrained\noptimization formulae that minimize the entropy of the training tree-bank given\nthe specialized grammar, under the constraint that the size of the specialized\nmodel does not exceed a predefined maximum, and 3) they enable integrating the\nspecialized model with the original one in a complementary manner.

    "summary": "It is shown that personalization of web content can be advantageously viewed\nas a form of partial evaluation --- a technique well known in the programming\nlanguages community. The basic idea is to model a recommendation space as a\nprogram, then partially evaluate this program with respect to user preferences\n(and features) to obtain specialized content. This technique supports both\ncontent-based and collaborative approaches, and is applicable to a range of\napplications that require automatic information integration from multiple web\nsources. The effectiveness of this methodology is illustrated by two example\napplications --- (i) personalizing content for visitors to the Blacksburg\nElectronic Village (http://www.bev.net), and (ii) locating and selecting\nscientific software on the Internet. The scalability of this technique is\ndemonstrated by its ability to interface with online web ontologies that index\nthousands of web pages.",

    "summary": "Agents are small programs that autonomously take actions based on changes in\ntheir environment or ``state.'' Over the last few years, there have been an\nincreasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and/or\ncollaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts, Eiter, Subrahmanian amd\nPick (AIJ, 108(1-2), pages 179-255) have shown how agents may be built on top\nof legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are\ncompletely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent's state. Thus,\ntheir framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react\nwhen the agent is 100% sure about what is true/false in the world state. In\nthis paper, we propose the concept of a \\emph{probabilistic agent program} and\nshow how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may\nbuild a declarative ``probabilistic'' agent program on top of it which supports\ndecision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative\nsemantics for probabilistic agent programs. We show that the second semantics,\nthough more epistemically appealing, is more complex to compute. We provide\nsound and complete algorithms to compute the semantics of \\emph{positive} agent\nprograms.",

For each logic, we introduce several\nsemantics by means of fixpoints of operators on the lattice of belief pairs.\nOur results elucidate an underlying isomorphism of the respective semantic\nconstructions. In particular, we show that the interpretation of defaults as\nmodal formulas proposed by Konolige allows us to represent all semantics for\ndefault logic in terms of the corresponding semantics for autoepistemic logic.\nThus, our results conclusively establish that default logic can indeed be\nviewed as a fragment of autoepistemic logic. However, as we also demonstrate,\nthe semantics of Moore and Reiter are given by different operators and occupy\ndifferent locations in their corresponding families of semantics. This result\nexplains the source of the longstanding difficulty to formally relate these two\nsemantics.

Thus, when studying randomized algorithms, there\nare two important characteristics that need to be considered: the running time\nand, even more importantly, the accuracy --- a measure of likelihood that a\nsatisfying assignment will be found, provided one exists. In fact, we argue\nthat without a reference to the accuracy, the notion of the running time for\nrandomized algorithms is not well-defined. In this paper, we introduce a formal\nnotion of accuracy. We use it to define a concept of the running time. We use\nboth notions to study the random walk strategy GSAT algorithm. We investigate\nthe dependence of accuracy on properties of input formulas such as\nclause-to-variable ratio and the number of satisfying assignments.

I propose that until a\nprivate syntax (syntactic autonomy) is discovered by dynamically coherent\nagents, there are no significant or interesting types of closure or autonomy.\nWhen syntactic autonomy is established, then, because of a process of\ndescription-based selected self-organization, open-ended evolution is enabled.\nAt this stage, agents depend, in addition to dynamics, on localized, symbolic\nmemory, thus adding a level of dynamical incoherence to their interaction with\nthe environment. Furthermore, it is the appearance of syntactic autonomy which\nenables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the\nsame syntax. To investigate how we can study the emergence of syntax from\ndynamical systems, experiments with cellular automata leading to emergent\ncomputation to solve non-trivial tasks are discussed.

However,\nif we can choose the logics from a uniform framework then the problem of\ncombining them is greatly simplified. In this paper, we develop such a\nframework for defeasible logics.

In\nthe context of adaptive information filtering, a filtering agent's beliefs\nabout a user's information needs have to be revised regularly with reference to\nthe user's most current information preferences. This learning and adaptation\nprocess is essential for maintaining the agent's filtering performance. The AGM\nbelief revision paradigm provides a rigorous foundation for modelling rational\nand minimal changes to an agent's beliefs. In particular, the maxi-adjustment\nmethod, which follows the AGM rationale of belief change, offers a sound and\nrobust computational mechanism to develop adaptive agents so that learning\nautonomy of these agents can be enhanced.

One such\nlanguage is the language of epistemic specifications. As is usual with logic\nprogramming languages, the problem of answering queries is intractable in the\ngeneral case.

We also identify a\nsubclass of DNNF which we call deterministic DNNF, d-DNNF, and show that the\nprevious complexity guarantees on compiling DNNF continue to hold for this\nstricter subclass, which has stronger properties. In particular, we present a\nnew operation on d-DNNF which allows us to count its models under the\nassertion, retraction and flipping of every literal by traversing the d-DNNF\ntwice. That is, after such traversal, we can test in constant-time: the\nentailment of any literal by the d-DNNF, and the consistency of the d-DNNF\nunder the retraction or flipping of any literal.

    "summary": "Infinite loops and redundant computations are long recognized open problems\nin Prolog. Two ways have been explored to resolve these problems: loop checking\nand tabling. Loop checking can cut infinite loops, but it cannot be both sound\nand complete even for function-free logic programs. Tabling seems to be an\neffective way to resolve infinite loops and redundant computations. However,\nexisting tabulated resolutions, such as OLDT-resolution, SLG- resolution, and\nTabulated SLS-resolution, are non-linear because they rely on the\nsolution-lookup mode in formulating tabling. The principal disadvantage of\nnon-linear resolutions is that they cannot be implemented using a simple\nstack-based memory structure like that in Prolog. Moreover, some strictly\nsequential operators such as cuts may not be handled as easily as in Prolog.\n  In this paper, we propose a hybrid method to resolve infinite loops and\nredundant computations. We combine the ideas of loop checking and tabling to\nestablish a linear tabulated resolution called TP-resolution. TP-resolution has\ntwo distinctive features: (1) It makes linear tabulated derivations in the same\nway as Prolog except that infinite loops are broken and redundant computations\nare reduced. It handles cuts as effectively as Prolog. (2) It is sound and\ncomplete for positive logic programs with the bounded-term-size property.

The E-Planner is based\nupon a reformulation of the Language E in argumentation terms and a natural\nproof theory resulting from the reformulation. It uses an extension of this\nproof theory by means of abduction for the generation of plans and adopts\nargumentation-based techniques for extending weak plans into safe plans.

The first international NMR workshop was held\nat Mohonk Mountain House, New Paltz, New York in June, 1984, and was organized\nby Ray Reiter and Bonnie Webber.\n  In the last 10 years the area of nonmonotonic reasoning has seen a number of\nimportant developments. Significant theoretical advances were made in the\nunderstanding of general abstract principles underlying nonmonotonicity. Key\nresults on the expressibility and computational complexity of nonmonotonic\nlogics were established. The role of nonmonotonic reasoning in belief revision,\nabduction, reasoning about action, planing and uncertainty was further\nclarified. Several successful NMR systems were built and used in applications\nsuch as planning, scheduling, logic programming and constraint satisfaction.\n  The papers in the proceedings reflect these recent advances in the field.\nThey are grouped into sections corresponding to special sessions as they were\nheld at the workshop:\n  1. General NMR track\n  2. Abductive reasonig\n  3. Belief revision: theory and practice\n  4. Representing action and planning\n  5. Systems descriptions and demonstrations\n  6.

    "title": "Constraint Programming viewed as Rule-based Programming",
    "summary": "We study here a natural situation when constraint programming can be entirely\nreduced to rule-based programming. To this end we explain first how one can\ncompute on constraint satisfaction problems using rules represented by simple\nfirst-order formulas. Then we consider constraint satisfaction problems that\nare based on predefined, explicitly given constraints. To solve them we first\nderive rules from these explicitly given constraints and limit the computation\nprocess to a repeated application of these rules, combined with labeling.We\nconsider here two types of rules. The first type, that we call equality rules,\nleads to a new notion of local consistency, called {\\em rule consistency} that\nturns out to be weaker than arc consistency for constraints of arbitrary arity\n(called hyper-arc consistency in \\cite{MS98b}). For Boolean constraints rule\nconsistency coincides with the closure under the well-known propagation rules\nfor Boolean constraints. The second type of rules, that we call membership\nrules, yields a rule-based characterization of arc consistency. To show\nfeasibility of this rule-based approach to constraint programming we show how\nboth types of rules can be automatically generated, as {\\tt CHR} rules of\n\\cite{fruhwirth-constraint-95}. This yields an implementation of this approach\nto programming by means of constraint logic programming. We illustrate the\nusefulness of this approach to constraint programming by discussing various\nexamples, including Boolean constraints, two typical examples of many valued\nlogics, constraints dealing with Waltz's language for describing polyhedral\nscenes, and Allen's qualitative approach to temporal logic.",

    "summary": "Answer-set programming (ASP) has emerged recently as a viable programming\nparadigm well attuned to search problems in AI, constraint satisfaction and\ncombinatorics. Propositional logic is, arguably, the simplest ASP system with\nan intuitive semantics supporting direct modeling of problem constraints.\nHowever, for some applications, especially those requiring that transitive\nclosure be computed, it requires additional variables and results in large\ntheories. Consequently, it may not be a practical computational tool for such\nproblems. On the other hand, ASP systems based on nonmonotonic logics, such as\nstable logic programming, can handle transitive closure computation efficiently\nand, in general, yield very concise theories as problem representations. Their\nsemantics is, however, more complex. Searching for the middle ground, in this\npaper we introduce a new nonmonotonic logic, DATALOG with constraints or DC.\nInformally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of\nHorn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of\nthe propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the\nsystem, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the\nsyntax and semantics of DC, and study its properties. We discuss an\nimplementation of DC and present results of experimental study of the\neffectiveness of DC, comparing it with CSAT, a satisfiability checker and\nSMODELS implementation of stable logic programming. Our results show that DC is\ncompetitive with the other two approaches, in case of many search problems,\noften yielding much more efficient solutions.",

The reason of this inadequacy is due to the high degree of\ncomplexity of the mechanisms that govern these systems. It is proposed in this\npaper to shift the attention from modeling the engineering system itself to\nmodeling the uncertainty that underlies its behavior. A mathematical framework\nfor modeling the uncertainty in complex engineering systems is developed. This\nframework uses the results of computational learning theory.

    "summary": "The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is solidly based on a provably\nideal method of inference using Kolmogorov complexity. We test how the theory\nbehaves in practice on a general problem in model selection: that of learning\nthe best model granularity. The performance of a model depends critically on\nthe granularity, for example the choice of precision of the parameters. Too\nhigh precision generally involves modeling of accidental noise and too low\nprecision may lead to confusion of models that should be distinguished. This\nprecision is often determined ad hoc. In MDL the best model is the one that\nmost compresses a two-part code of the data set: this embodies ``Occam's\nRazor.'' In two quite different experimental settings the theoretical value\ndetermined using MDL coincides with the best value found experimentally. In the\nfirst experiment the task is to recognize isolated handwritten characters in\none subject's handwriting, irrespective of size and orientation. Based on a new\nmodification of elastic matching, using multiple prototypes per character, the\noptimal prediction rate is predicted for the learned parameter (length of\nsampling interval) considered most likely by MDL, which is shown to coincide\nwith the best value found experimentally. In the second experiment the task is\nto model a robot arm with two degrees of freedom using a three layer\nfeed-forward neural network where we need to determine the number of nodes in\nthe hidden layer giving best modeling performance. The optimal model (the one\nthat extrapolizes best on unseen examples) is predicted for the number of nodes\nin the hidden layer considered most likely by MDL, which again is found to\ncoincide with the best value found experimentally.",

Our approach obtains a case-role\nanalysis, in which the semantic roles of the verb are identified. In order to\ncover all the possible syntactic realisations of a verb, our system combines\ntheir argument structure with a set of general semantic labelled diatheses\nmodels. Combining them, the system builds a set of syntactic-semantic patterns\nwith their own role-case representation.

The pattern matching is performed between the\nsyntactic-semantic patterns and the feature-structure tree representing the\nmorphological, syntactical and semantic information of the analysed sentence.\nFor sentences assigned to the correct model, the semantic parsing system we are\npresenting identifies correctly more than 73% of possible semantic case-roles.",

With\nthis technique, an administrator has to tune a set of rules for each topic.\nHowever, filters become obsolescent over time. The decrease of their\nperformances is due to diachronic polysemy of terms that involves a loss of\nprecision and to diachronic polymorphism of concepts that involves a loss of\nrecall.\n  To help the administrator to maintain his filters, we have developed a method\nwhich automatically detects filtering obsolescence. It consists in making a\nlearning-based control filter using a set of documents which have already been\ncategorised as relevant or not relevant by the rule-based filter. The idea is\nto supervise this filter by processing a differential comparison of its\noutcomes with those of the control one.\n  This method has many advantages. It is simple to implement since the training\nset used by the learning is supplied by the rule-based filter. Thus, both the\nmaking and the use of the control filter are fully automatic.

This is the first known instance of\nan efficient noise-tolerant algorithm for a concept class that is provably not\nlearnable in the Statistical Query model of Kearns. Thus, we demonstrate that\nthe set of problems learnable in the statistical query model is a strict subset\nof those problems learnable in the presence of noise in the PAC model.\n  In coding-theory terms, what we give is a poly(n)-time algorithm for decoding\nlinear k by n codes in the presence of random noise for the case of k = c log n\nloglog n for some c > 0. (The case of k = O(log n) is trivial since one can\njust individually check each of the 2^k possible messages and choose the one\nthat yields the closest codeword.)\n  A natural extension of the statistical query model is to allow queries about\nstatistical properties that involve t-tuples of examples (as opposed to single\nexamples). The second result of this paper is to show that any class of\nfunctions learnable (strongly or weakly) with t-wise queries for t = O(log n)\nis also weakly learnable with standard unary queries.

In such\na setting, the traditional approach of serving these requests one at a time via\nqueues (e.g. \\textsf{FIFO} queues, priority queues) is insufficient.\nAlternative models are essential to improve the performance of such\n\\emph{heavily loaded} agents. In this paper, we propose a set of\n\\emph{cost-based algorithms} to \\emph{optimize} and \\emph{merge} multiple\nrequests submitted to an agent. In order to merge a set of requests, one first\nneeds to identify commonalities among such requests.

Second, we\nprovide two algorithms (and various accompanying heuristics) which allow an\nagent to automatically rewrite requests so as to avoid redundant work---these\nalgorithms take invariants associated with the agent into account. Our\nalgorithms are independent of any specific agent framework.

Considering\nthe dopaminergic signal-to-noise neuronal modulation in the central nervous\nsystem, and the existence of semantic maps in human brain, a self-organizing\nneural network model was developed to unify the different thought processes\ninto a single neurocomputational substrate. Simulations were performed varying\nthe dopaminergic modulation and observing the different patterns that emerged\nat the semantic map. Assuming that the thought process is the total pattern\nelicited at the output layer of the neural network, the model shows how the\nnormal and abnormal thinking are generated and that there are no borders\nbetween their different manifestations. Actually, a continuum of different\nqualitative reasoning, ranging from delusion to disorganization of thought, and\npassing through the normal and the creative thinking, seems to be more\nplausible.

With respect to the\nseminal mean-variance model of Markowitz, we consider additional constraints on\nthe cardinality of the portfolio and on the quantity of individual shares. Such\nconstraints better capture the real-world trading system, but make the problem\nmore difficult to be solved with exact methods. We explore the use of local\nsearch techniques, mainly tabu search, for the portfolio selection problem. We\ncompare and combine previous work on portfolio selection that makes use of the\nlocal search approach and we propose new algorithms that combine different\nneighborhood relations. In addition, we show how the use of randomization and\nof a simple form of adaptiveness simplifies the setting of a large number of\ncritical parameters. Finally, we show how our techniques perform on public\nbenchmarks.",

This theory is\ndistinguished from the familiar parallel-distributed adaptation theory of\nneural networks in terms of channel-based convergence to the target rules. We\nshow how to realize this theory in a learning system named CFRule. CFRule is a\nparallel weight-based model, but it departs from traditional neural computing\nin that its internal knowledge is comprehensible. Furthermore, when the model\nconverges upon training, each channel converges to a target rule. The model\nadaptation rule is derived by multi-level parallel weight optimization based on\ngradient descent. Since, however, gradient descent only guarantees local\noptimization, a multi-channel regression-based optimization strategy is\ndeveloped to effectively deal with this problem. Formally, we prove that the\nCFRule model can explicitly and precisely encode any given rule set. Also, we\nprove a property related to asynchronous parallel convergence, which is a\ncritical element of the multi-channel parallel adaptation theory for rule\nlearning. Thanks to the quantizability nature of the CFRule model, rules can be\nextracted completely and soundly via a threshold-based mechanism. Finally, the\npractical application of the theory is demonstrated in DNA promoter recognition\nand hepatitis prognosis prediction.",

In previous work,\nthe definition of the transduction relation defined by a synchronous TAG was\ngiven by appeal to an iterative rewriting process. The rewriting definition of\nderivation is problematic in that it greatly extends the expressivity of the\nformalism and makes the design of parsing algorithms difficult if not\nimpossible. We introduce a simple, natural definition of synchronous\ntree-adjoining derivation, based on isomorphisms between standard\ntree-adjoining derivations, that avoids the expressivity and implementability\nproblems of the original rewriting definition. The decrease in expressivity,\nwhich would otherwise make the method unusable, is offset by the incorporation\nof an alternative definition of standard tree-adjoining derivation, previously\nproposed for completely separate reasons, thereby making it practical to\nentertain using the natural definition of synchronous derivation. Nonetheless,\nsome remaining problematic cases call for yet more flexibility in the\ndefinition; the isomorphism requirement may have to be relaxed.

In addition to its generality, a syntactic-head-driven algorithm\nprovides a basis for a logically well-defined treatment of the movement of\n(syntactic) heads, for which only ad-hoc solutions existed, so far.",

    "title": "Natural Language Parsing as Statistical Pattern Recognition",
    "summary": "Traditional natural language parsers are based on rewrite rule systems\ndeveloped in an arduous, time-consuming manner by grammarians. A majority of\nthe grammarian's efforts are devoted to the disambiguation process, first\nhypothesizing rules which dictate constituent categories and relationships\namong words in ambiguous sentences, and then seeking exceptions and corrections\nto these rules.\n  In this work, I propose an automatic method for acquiring a statistical\nparser from a set of parsed sentences which takes advantage of some initial\nlinguistic input, but avoids the pitfalls of the iterative and seemingly\nendless grammar development process. Based on distributionally-derived and\nlinguistically-based features of language, this parser acquires a set of\nstatistical decision trees which assign a probability distribution on the space\nof parse trees given the input sentence. These decision trees take advantage of\nsignificant amount of contextual information, potentially including all of the\nlexical information in the sentence, to produce highly accurate statistical\nmodels of the disambiguation process. By basing the disambiguation criteria\nselection on entropy reduction rather than human intuition, this parser\ndevelopment method is able to consider more sentences than a human grammarian\ncan when making individual disambiguation rules.\n  In experiments between a parser, acquired using this statistical framework,\nand a grammarian's rule-based parser, developed over a ten-year period, both\nusing the same training material and test sentences, the decision tree parser\nsignificantly outperformed the grammar-based parser on the accuracy measure\nwhich the grammarian was trying to maximize, achieving an accuracy of 78%\ncompared to the grammar-based parser's 69%.",

The parser, Pearl, is a time-asynchronous bottom-up chart parser\nwith Earley-type top-down prediction which pursues the highest-scoring theory\nin the chart, where the score of a theory represents the extent to which the\ncontext of the sentence predicts that interpretation. This parser differs from\nprevious attempts at stochastic parsers in that it uses a richer form of\nconditional probabilities based on context to predict likelihood. Pearl also\nprovides a framework for incorporating the results of previous work in\npart-of-speech assignment, unknown word models, and other probabilistic models\nof linguistic features into one parsing tool, interleaving these techniques\ninstead of using the traditional pipeline architecture. In preliminary tests,\nPearl has been successful at resolving part-of-speech and word (in speech\nprocessing) ambiguity, determining categories for unknown words, and selecting\ncorrect parses first using a very loosely fitting covering grammar.",

The process begins with a maximum likelihood HMM that\ndirectly encodes the training data. Successively more general models are\nproduced by merging HMM states. A Bayesian posterior probability criterion is\nused to determine which states to merge and when to stop generalizing. The\nprocedure may be considered a heuristic search for the HMM structure with the\nhighest posterior probability. We discuss a variety of possible priors for\nHMMs, as well as a number of approximations which improve the computational\nefficiency of the algorithm. We studied three applications to evaluate the\nprocedure. The first compares the merging algorithm with the standard\nBaum-Welch approach in inducing simple finite-state languages from small,\npositive-only training samples. We found that the merging procedure is more\nrobust and accurate, particularly with a small amount of training data. The\nsecond application uses labelled speech data from the TIMIT database to build\ncompact, multiple-pronunciation word models that can be used in speech\nrecognition. Finally, we describe how the algorithm was incorporated in an\noperational speech understanding system, where it is combined with neural\nnetwork acoustic likelihood estimators to improve performance over\nsingle-pronunciation word models.",

We assume the existence of a ``natural language engine'' capable\nof mediating between surface linguistic string and their representations as\n``literal'' logical forms: the focus of interest will be the question of\nrelating ``literal'' logical forms to representations in terms of primitives\nmeaningful to the underlying database engine. We begin by describing the nature\nof the problem, and show how a variety of interface functionalities can be\nconsidered as instances of a type of formal inference task which we call\n``Abductive Equivalential Translation'' (AET); functionalities which can be\nreduced to this form include answering questions, responding to commands,\nreasoning about the completeness of answers, answering meta-questions of type\n``Do you know...'', and generating assertions and questions. In each case, a\n``linguistic domain theory'' (LDT) $\\Gamma$ and an input formula $F$ are given,\nand the goal is to construct a formula with certain properties which is\nequivalent to $F$, given $\\Gamma$ and a set of permitted assumptions. If the\nLDT is of a certain specified type, whose formulas are either conditional\nequivalences or Horn-clauses, we show that the AET problem can be reduced to a\ngoal-directed inference method. We present an abstract description of this\nmethod, and sketch its realization in Prolog. The relationship between AET and\nseveral problems previously discussed in the literature is discussed. In\nparticular, we show how AET can provide a simple and elegant solution to the\nso-called ``Doctor on Board'' problem, and in effect allows a\n``relativization'' of the Closed World Assumption. The ideas in the thesis have\nall been implemented concretely within the SRI CLARE project, using a real\nprojects and payments database.

Its main features are 1) a\ndiscourse-plan-based approach to implicature, 2) a reversible architecture for\ngeneration and interpretation, 3) a hybrid reasoning model that employs both\nplan inference and logical inference, and 4) use of stimulus conditions to\nmodel a speaker's motivation for providing appropriate, unrequested\ninformation. The model handles a wider range of types of indirect answers than\nprevious computational models and has several significant advantages.",

    "title": "Corpus-Driven Knowledge Acquisition for Discourse Analysis",
    "summary": "The availability of large on-line text corpora provides a natural and\npromising bridge between the worlds of natural language processing (NLP) and\nmachine learning (ML). In recent years, the NLP community has been aggressively\ninvestigating statistical techniques to drive part-of-speech taggers, but\napplication-specific text corpora can be used to drive knowledge acquisition at\nmuch higher levels as well. In this paper we will show how ML techniques can be\nused to support knowledge acquisition for information extraction systems. It is\noften very difficult to specify an explicit domain model for many information\nextraction applications, and it is always labor intensive to implement\nhand-coded heuristics for each new domain. We have discovered that it is\nnevertheless possible to use ML algorithms in order to capture knowledge that\nis only implicitly present in a representative text corpus. Our work addresses\nissues traditionally associated with discourse analysis and intersentential\ninference generation, and demonstrates the utility of ML algorithms at this\nhigher level of language analysis. The benefits of our work address the\nportability and scalability of information extraction (IE) technologies. When\nhand-coded heuristics are used to manage discourse analysis in an information\nextraction system, months of programming effort are easily needed to port a\nsuccessful IE system to a new domain. We will show how ML algorithms can reduce\nthis",

Speech parsing describes the syntactic and semantic analysis\nof spontaneous spoken language. The general approach is based on incremental\nimmediate flat analysis, learning of syntactic and semantic speech parsing,\nparallel integration of current hypotheses, and the consideration of various\nforms of speech related errors. The goal for this approach is to explore the\nparallel interactions between various knowledge sources for learning\nincremental fault-tolerant speech parsing. This approach is examined in a\nsystem SCREEN using various hybrid connectionist techniques. Hybrid\nconnectionist techniques are examined because of their promising properties of\ninherent fault tolerance, learning, gradedness and parallel constraint\nintegration. The input for SCREEN is hypotheses about recognized words of a\nspoken utterance potentially analyzed by a speech system, the output is\nhypotheses about the flat syntactic and semantic analysis of the utterance. In\nthis paper we focus on the general approach, the overall architecture, and\nexamples for learning flat syntactic speech parsing.

    "summary": "In many current speech recognizers, a statistical language model is used to\nindicate how likely it is that a certain word will be spoken next, given the\nwords recognized so far. How can statistical language models be improved so\nthat more complex speech recognition tasks can be tackled? Since the knowledge\nof the weaknesses of any theory often makes improving the theory easier, the\ncentral idea of this thesis is to analyze the weaknesses of existing\nstatistical language models in order to subsequently improve them. To that end,\nwe formally define a weakness of a statistical language model in terms of the\nlogarithm of the total probability, LTP, a term closely related to the standard\nperplexity measure used to evaluate statistical language models. We apply our\ndefinition of a weakness to a frequently used statistical language model,\ncalled a bi-pos model. This results, for example, in a new modeling of unknown\nwords which improves the performance of the model by 14% to 21%. Moreover, one\nof the identified weaknesses has prompted the development of our generalized\nN-pos language model, which is also outlined in this thesis. It can incorporate\nlinguistic knowledge even if it extends over many words and this is not\nfeasible in a traditional N-pos model. This leads to a discussion of\nwhatknowledge should be added to statistical language models in general and we\ngive criteria for selecting potentially useful knowledge. These results show\nthe usefulness of both our definition of a weakness and of performing an\nanalysis of weaknesses of statistical language models in general.",

    "summary": "Syntactic ambiguity abounds in natural language, yet humans have no\ndifficulty coping with it. In fact, the process of ambiguity resolution is\nalmost always unconscious. But it is not infallible, however, as example 1\ndemonstrates.\n  1. The horse raced past the barn fell.\n  This sentence is perfectly grammatical, as is evident when it appears in the\nfollowing context:\n  2. Two horses were being shown off to a prospective buyer. One was raced past\na meadow. and the other was raced past a barn. ...\n  Grammatical yet unprocessable sentences such as 1 are called `garden-path\nsentences.' Their existence provides an opportunity to investigate the human\nsentence processing mechanism by studying how and when it fails. The aim of\nthis thesis is to construct a computational model of language understanding\nwhich can predict processing difficulty. The data to be modeled are known\nexamples of garden path and non-garden path sentences, and other results from\npsycholinguistics.\n  It is widely believed that there are two distinct loci of computation in\nsentence processing: syntactic parsing and semantic interpretation. One\nlongstanding controversy is which of these two modules bears responsibility for\nthe immediate resolution of ambiguity. My claim is that it is the latter, and\nthat the syntactic processing module is a very simple device which blindly and\nfaithfully constructs all possible analyses for the sentence up to the current\npoint of processing. The interpretive module serves as a filter, occasionally\ndiscarding certain of these analyses which it deems less appropriate for the\nongoing discourse than their competitors.\n  This document is divided into three parts. The first is introductory, and\nreviews a selection of proposals from the sentence processing literature. The\nsecond part explores a body of data which has been adduced in support of a\ntheory of structural preferences --- one that is inconsistent with the present\nclaim. I show how the current proposal can be specified to account for the\navailable data, and moreover to predict where structural preference theories\nwill go wrong. The third part is a theoretical investigation of how well the\nproposed architecture can be realized using current conceptions of linguistic\ncompetence.

It consists of a\nsummary and three articles. {\\it Morphological disambiguation} documents a\ngrammar for morphological (or part-of-speech) disambiguation of English, done\nwithin the Constraint Grammar framework proposed by Fred Karlsson. The\ndisambiguator seeks to discard those of the alternative morphological analyses\nproposed by the lexical analyser that are contextually illegitimate. The 1,100\nconstraints express some 23 general, essentially syntactic statements as\nrestrictions on the linear order of morphological tags. The error rate of the\nmorphological disambiguator is about ten times smaller than that of another\nstate-of-the-art probabilistic disambiguator, given that both are allowed to\nleave some of the hardest ambiguities unresolved. This accuracy suggests the\nviability of the grammar-based approach to natural language parsing, thus also\ncontributing to the more general debate concerning the viability of\nprobabilistic vs.\\ linguistic techniques. {\\it Experiments with heuristics}\naddresses the question of how to resolve those ambiguities that survive the\nmorphological disambiguator. Two approaches are presented and empirically\nevaluated: (i) heuristic disambiguation constraints and (ii) techniques for\nlearning from the fully disambiguated part of the corpus and then applying this\ninformation to resolving remaining ambiguities.",

    "title": "Tracking Point of View in Narrative",
    "summary": "Third-person fictional narrative text is composed not only of passages that\nobjectively narrate events, but also of passages that present characters'\nthoughts, perceptions, and inner states. Such passages take a character's\n``psychological point of view''. A language understander must determine the\ncurrent psychological point of view in order to distinguish the beliefs of the\ncharacters from the facts of the story, to correctly attribute beliefs and\nother attitudes to their sources, and to understand the discourse relations\namong sentences. Tracking the psychological point of view is not a trivial\nproblem, because many sentences are not explicitly marked for point of view,\nand whether the point of view of a sentence is objective or that of a character\n(and if the latter, which character it is) often depends on the context in\nwhich the sentence appears. Tracking the psychological point of view is the\nproblem addressed in this work. The approach is to seek, by extensive\nexaminations of naturally-occurring narrative, regularities in the ways that\nauthors manipulate point of view, and to develop an algorithm that tracks point\nof view on the basis of the regularities found. This paper presents this\nalgorithm, gives demonstrations of an implemented system, and describes the\nresults of some preliminary empirical studies, which lend support to the\nalgorithm.",

    "summary": "Automatic text tagging is an important component in higher level analysis of\ntext corpora, and its output can be used in many natural language processing\napplications. In languages like Turkish or Finnish, with agglutinative\nmorphology, morphological disambiguation is a very crucial process in tagging,\nas the structures of many lexical forms are morphologically ambiguous. This\npaper describes a POS tagger for Turkish text based on a full-scale two-level\nspecification of Turkish morphology that is based on a lexicon of about 24,000\nroot words. This is augmented with a multi-word and idiomatic construct\nrecognizer, and most importantly morphological disambiguator based on local\nneighborhood constraints, heuristics and limited amount of statistical\ninformation. The tagger also has functionality for statistics compilation and\nfine tuning of the morphological analyzer, such as logging erroneous\nmorphological parses, commonly used roots, etc. Preliminary results indicate\nthat the tagger can tag about 98-99\\% of the texts accurately with very minimal\nuser intervention. Furthermore for sentences morphologically disambiguated with\nthe tagger, an LFG parser developed for Turkish, generates, on the average,\n50\\% less ambiguous parses and parses almost 2.5 times faster. The tagging\nfunctionality is not specific to Turkish, and can be applied to any language\nwith a proper morphological analysis interface.",

In this article, we look at\na set of principles derived from psychological findings to argue for a\nparticular organization of linguistic knowledge along with a particular\nprocessing strategy and present a computational model of sentence processing\nbased on those principles. Many studies have shown that human sentence\ncomprehension is an incremental and interactive process in which semantic and\nother higher-level information interacts with syntactic information to make\ninformed commitments as early as possible at a local ambiguity. Early\ncommitments may be made by using top-down guidance from knowledge of different\ntypes, each of which must be applicable independently of others. Further\nevidence from studies of error recovery and delayed decisions points toward an\narbitration mechanism for combining syntactic and semantic information in\nresolving ambiguities. In order to account for all of the above, we propose\nthat all types of linguistic knowledge must be represented in a common form but\nmust be separable so that they can be applied independently of each other and\nintegrated at processing time by the arbitrator. We present such a uniform\nrepresentation and a computational model called COMPERE based on the\nrepresentation and the processing strategy.",

    "summary": "The development of models of human sentence processing has traditionally\nfollowed one of two paths. Either the model posited a sequence of processing\nmodules, each with its own task-specific knowledge (e.g., syntax and\nsemantics), or it posited a single processor utilizing different types of\nknowledge inextricably integrated into a monolithic knowledge base. Our\nprevious work in modeling the sentence processor resulted in a model in which\ndifferent processing modules used separate knowledge sources but operated in\nparallel to arrive at the interpretation of a sentence. One highlight of this\nmodel is that it offered an explanation of how the sentence processor might\nrecover from an error in choosing the meaning of an ambiguous word. Recent\nexperimental work by Laurie Stowe strongly suggests that the human sentence\nprocessor deals with syntactic error recovery using a mechanism very much like\nthat proposed by our model of semantic error recovery. Another way to interpret\nStowe's finding is this: the human sentence processor consists of a single\nunified processing module utilizing multiple independent knowledge sources in\nparallel. A sentence processor built upon this architecture should at times\nexhibit behavior associated with modular approaches, and at other times act\nlike an integrated system. In this paper we explore some of these ideas via a\nprototype computational model of sentence processing called COMPERE, and\npropose a set of psychological experiments for testing our theories.",

It also offers a\nreasonably automatic means to gather evidence on whether a more complex,\ncontext-sensitive model using the same general kind of linguistic information\nis likely to reward the effort that would be required to develop it: if\nclustering improves the performance of a model, this proves the existence of\nfurther context dependencies, not exploited by the unclustered model. As\nevidence for these claims, I present results showing that clustering improves\nsome models but not others for the ATIS domain. These results are consistent\nwith other findings for such models, suggesting that the existence or otherwise\nof an improvement brought about by clustering is indeed a good pointer to\nwhether it is worth developing further the unclustered model.",

The\nadvantages of the formlism are shown with respect to a grammar for a fragment\nof German that deals with (i) quantifier scope ambiguities triggered by\nscrambling and/or movement and (ii) ambiguities that arise from the\ncollective/distributive distinction of plural NPs. The syntax-semantics\ninterface directly implements syntactic conditions on quantifier scoping and\ndistributivity. The construction of semantic representations is guided by\ngeneral principles governing the interaction between syntax and semantics. Each\nof these principles acts as a constraint to narrow down the set of possible\ninterpretations of a sentence. Meanings of ambiguous sentences are represented\nby single partial representations (so-called U(nderspecified) D(iscourse)\nR(epresentation) S(tructure)s) to which further constraints can be added\nmonotonically to gain more information about the content of a sentence. There\nis no need to build up a large number of alternative representations of the\nsentence which are then filtered by subsequent discourse and world knowledge.\nThe advantage of UDRSs is not only that they allow for monotonic incremental\ninterpretation but also that they are equipped with truth conditions and a\nproof theory that allows for inferences to be drawn directly on structures\nwhere quantifier scope is not resolved.",

    "summary": "In part of speech tagging by Hidden Markov Model, a statistical model is used\nto assign grammatical categories to words in a text. Early work in the field\nrelied on a corpus which had been tagged by a human annotator to train the\nmodel. More recently, Cutting {\\it et al.} (1992) suggest that training can be\nachieved with a minimal lexicon and a limited amount of {\\em a priori}\ninformation about probabilities, by using Baum-Welch re-estimation to\nautomatically refine the model. In this paper, I report two experiments\ndesigned to determine how much manual training information is needed. The first\nexperiment suggests that initial biasing of either lexical or transition\nprobabilities is essential to achieve a good accuracy. The second experiment\nreveals that there are three distinct patterns of Baum-Welch re-estimation. In\ntwo of the patterns, the re-estimation ultimately reduces the accuracy of the\ntagging rather than improving it. The pattern which is applicable can be\npredicted from the quality of the initial model and the similarity between the\ntagged training corpus (if any) and the corpus to be tagged. Heuristics for\ndeciding how to use re-estimation in an effective manner are given. The\nconclusions are broadly in agreement with those of Merialdo (1994), but give\ngreater detail about the contributions of different parts of the model.",

Unlike the popular n-best techniques developed for integrating mainly\nHMM-based speech and natural language systems in word level, which is obviously\ninadequate for the morphologically complex agglutinative languages, our model\nconstructs a spoken language system based on the phoneme-level integration. The\nTDNN-CYK spoken language architecture is designed and implemented using the\nTDNN-based diphone recognition module integrated with the table-driven\nphonological/morphological co-analysis. Our integration model provides a\nseamless integration of speech and natural language for connectionist speech\nrecognition systems especially for morphologically complex languages such as\nKorean. Our experiment results show that the speaker-dependent continuous\nEojeol (word) recognition can be integrated with the morphological analysis\nwith over 80\\% morphological analysis success rate directly from the speech\ninput for the middle-level vocabularies.",

The proposed approach supports current linguistic analyses in\nconstraint-based formalisms like HPSG, inheritance in the lexicon, and\nknowledge representation for NLP systems.

    "summary": "Statistical language models frequently suffer from a lack of training data.\nThis problem can be alleviated by clustering, because it reduces the number of\nfree parameters that need to be trained. However, clustered models have the\nfollowing drawback: if there is ``enough'' data to train an unclustered model,\nthen the clustered variant may perform worse. On currently used language\nmodeling corpora, e.g. the Wall Street Journal corpus, how do the performances\nof a clustered and an unclustered model compare? While trying to address this\nquestion, we develop the following two ideas. First, to get a clustering\nalgorithm with potentially high performance, an existing algorithm is extended\nto deal with higher order N-grams. Second, to make it possible to cluster large\namounts of training data more efficiently, a heuristic to speed up the\nalgorithm is presented. The resulting clustering algorithm can be used to\ncluster trigrams on the Wall Street Journal corpus and the language models it\nproduces can compete with existing back-off models. Especially when there is\nonly little training data available, the clustered models clearly outperform\nthe back-off models.",

    "summary": "Natural language understanding applications such as interactive planning and\nface-to-face translation require extensive inferencing. Many of these\ninferences are based on the meaning of particular open class words. Providing a\nrepresentation that can support such lexically-based inferences is a primary\nconcern of lexical semantics. The representation language of first order logic\nhas well-understood semantics and a multitude of inferencing systems have been\nimplemented for it.

    "summary": "Infants face the difficult problem of segmenting continuous speech into words\nwithout the benefit of a fully developed lexicon. Several sources of\ninformation in speech might help infants solve this problem, including prosody,\nsemantic correlations and phonotactics. Research to date has focused on\ndetermining to which of these sources infants might be sensitive, but little\nwork has been done to determine the potential usefulness of each source. The\ncomputer simulations reported here are a first attempt to measure the\nusefulness of distributional and phonotactic information in segmenting phoneme\nsequences. The algorithms hypothesize different segmentations of the input into\nwords and select the best hypothesis according to the Minimum Description\nLength principle.

Our\napproach is similar to that of Vijay-Shanker & Schabes (1992) in that we\nformulate an inheritance hierarchy that efficiently encodes the elementary\ntrees. However, rather than creating a new representation formalism for this\ntask, we employ techniques of established utility in other lexically-oriented\nframeworks. In particular, we show how DATR's default mechanism can be used to\neliminate the need for a non-immediate dominance relation in the descriptions\nof the surface LTAG entries. This allows us to embed the tree structures in the\nfeature theory in a manner reminiscent of HPSG subcategorisation frames, and\nhence express lexical rules as relations over feature structures.",

    "summary": "When parsing unrestricted language, wide-covering grammars often\nundergenerate. Undergeneration can be tackled either by sentence correction, or\nby grammar correction. This thesis concentrates upon automatic grammar\ncorrection (or machine learning of grammar) as a solution to the problem of\nundergeneration. Broadly speaking, grammar correction approaches can be\nclassified as being either {\\it data-driven}, or {\\it model-based}. Data-driven\nlearners use data-intensive methods to acquire grammar. They typically use\ngrammar formalisms unsuited to the needs of practical text processing and\ncannot guarantee that the resulting grammar is adequate for subsequent semantic\ninterpretation. That is, data-driven learners acquire grammars that generate\nstrings that humans would judge to be grammatically ill-formed (they {\\it\novergenerate}) and fail to assign linguistically plausible parses. Model-based\nlearners are knowledge-intensive and are reliant for success upon the\ncompleteness of a {\\it model of grammaticality}. But in practice, the model\nwill be incomplete. Given that in this thesis we deal with undergeneration by\nlearning, we hypothesise that the combined use of data-driven and model-based\nlearning would allow data-driven learning to compensate for model-based\nlearning's incompleteness, whilst model-based learning would compensate for\ndata-driven learning's unsoundness. We describe a system that we have used to\ntest the hypothesis empirically. The system combines data-driven and\nmodel-based learning to acquire unification-based grammars that are more\nsuitable for practical text parsing. Using the Spoken English Corpus as data,\nand by quantitatively measuring undergeneration, overgeneration and parse\nplausibility, we show that this hypothesis is correct.",

The construction of semantic\nrepresentations is guided by general principles governing the interaction\nbetween syntax and semantics. Each of these principles acts as a constraint to\nnarrow down the set of possible interpretations of a sentence. Meanings of\nambiguous sentences are represented by single partial representations\n(so-called U(nderspecified) D(iscourse) R(epresentation) S(tructure)s) to which\nfurther constraints can be added monotonically to gain more information about\nthe content of a sentence. There is no need to build up a large number of\nalternative representations of the sentence which are then filtered by\nsubsequent discourse and world knowledge. The advantage of UDRSs is not only\nthat they allow for monotonic incremental interpretation but also that they are\nequipped with truth conditions and a proof theory that allows for inferences to\nbe drawn directly on structures where quantifier scope is not resolved.",

    "summary": "The recognition problem for attribute-value grammars (AVGs) was shown to be\nundecidable by Johnson in 1988. Therefore, the general form of AVGs is of no\npractical use. In this paper we study a very restricted form of AVG, for which\nthe recognition problem is decidable (though still NP-complete), the R-AVG. We\nshow that the R-AVG formalism captures all of the context free languages and\nmore, and introduce a variation on the so-called `off-line parsability\nconstraint', the `honest parsability constraint', which lets different types of\nR-AVG coincide precisely with well-known time complexity classes.",

We show that from these\ncomplexity results no immediate conclusions can be drawn about the complexity\nof the recognition problem of unification grammars using these feature\ntheories. On the one hand, the complexity of feature theories does not provide\nan upper bound for the complexity of such unification grammars.\n  On the other hand, the complexity of feature theories need not provide a\nlower bound. Therefore, we argue for formalisms that describe actual\nunification grammars instead of feature theories.

To account for\nhow clarification goals arise and how inferred clarification plans affect the\nagent, we propose that the agents are in a certain state of mind, and that this\nstate includes an intention to achieve the goal of referring and a plan that\nthe agents are currently considering. It is this mental state that sanctions\nthe adoption of goals and the acceptance of inferred plans, and so acts as a\nlink between understanding and generation.",

In the typical setting investigated till now, each\nclassifier is trained on data taken or resampled from a common data set, or\n(almost) randomly selected subsets thereof, and thus experiences similar\nquality of training data. However, in certain situations where data is acquired\nand analyzed on-line at several geographically distributed locations, the\nquality of data may vary substantially, leading to large discrepancies in\nperformance of individual classifiers. In this article we introduce and\ninvestigate a family of classifiers based on order statistics, for robust\nhandling of such cases. Based on a mathematical modeling of how the decision\nboundaries are affected by order statistic combiners, we derive expressions for\nthe reductions in error expected when such combiners are used. We show\nanalytically that the selection of the median, the maximum and in general, the\n$i^{th}$ order statistic improves classification performance. Furthermore, we\nintroduce the trim and spread combiners, both based on linear combinations of\nthe ordered classifier outputs, and show that they are quite beneficial in\npresence of outliers or uneven classifier performance.

The goal of the present paper is to demonstrate these relations.\n  The paper offers a plain-term interpretation of Culik's image compression, in\nregular image processing terms, without resorting to finite state machines and\nsimilar lofty language. The interpretation is shown to be algorithmically\nrelated to an IFS fractal image compression method: an IFS can be exactly\ntransformed into Culik's image code. Using this transformation, we will prove\nthat in a self-similar (part of an) image any zero wavelet coefficient is the\nroot of a zerotree, or its branch.\n  The paper discusses the zerotree coding of (wavelet/projection) coefficients\nas a common predictor/corrector, applied vertically through different layers of\na multiresolutional decomposition, rather than within the same view. This\ninterpretation leads to an insight into the evolution of image compression\ntechniques: from a causal single-layer prediction, to non-causal same-view\npredictions (wavelet decomposition among others) and to a causal cross-layer\nprediction (zero-trees, Culik's method).",

We have demonstrated this by analyzing the\neffect of concentrated noise on a typical decision making process of a\nsimplified two candidate voting model where our theorem establishes the lower\nbounds to a critical breakdown point of election (or decision) result by the\nbottom-up matching process are greater than the exact bound of the global\nmatching process implying that the former regional process is capable of\naccommodating a higher level of noise than the latter global process before the\nresult of decision overturns. We present a convincing experimental verification\nsupporting not only the theory by a white-black flag recognition problem in the\npresence of localized noise but also the validity of the conjecture by a facial\nrecognition problem that the theorem remains valid for other decision making\nprocesses involving an important dimension-reducing transform such as principal\ncomponent analysis or a Gabor transform.",

This paper presents an\nalgorithm for comparing trees that are labeled in an arbitrary manner. In\naddition to this generality, this algorithm is faster than the previous\nalgorithms.\n  Another contribution of this paper is on maximum weight bipartite matchings.\nWe show how to speed up the best known matching algorithms when the input\ngraphs are node-unbalanced or weight-unbalanced.

In this paper,\nwe propose a structured approach for studying patterns of multimodal language\nin the context of a 2D-display control. We consider systematic analysis of\ngestures from observable kinematical primitives to their semantics as pertinent\nto a linguistic structure. Proposed semantic classification of co-verbal\ngestures distinguishes six categories based on their spatio-temporal deixis. We\ndiscuss evolution of a computational framework for gesture and speech\nintegration which was used to develop an interactive testbed (iMAP). The\ntestbed enabled elicitation of adequate, non-sequential, multimodal patterns in\na narrative mode of HCI. Conducted user studies illustrate significance of\naccounting for the temporal alignment of gesture and speech parts in semantic\nmapping. Furthermore, co-occurrence analysis of gesture/speech production\nsuggests syntactic organization of gestures at the lexical level.",

It is assumed that the\nexamples are described by attribute-value pairs, where the values are symbolic.\nCross-validation requires a set of training examples and a set of testing\nexamples. The value of the attribute that is to be predicted is known to the\nlearner in the training set, but unknown in the testing set. The theory\ndemonstrates that cross-validation error has two components: error on the\ntraining set (inaccuracy) and sensitivity to noise (instability). This general\ntheory is then applied to voting in instance-based learning. Given an example\nin the testing set, a typical instance-based learning algorithm predicts the\ndesignated attribute by voting among the k nearest neighbors (the k most\nsimilar examples) to the testing example in the training set. Voting is\nintended to increase the stability (resistance to noise) of instance-based\nlearning, but a theoretical analysis shows that there are circumstances in\nwhich voting can be destabilizing. The theory suggests ways to minimize\ncross-validation error, by insuring that voting is stable and does not\nadversely affect accuracy.",

    "summary": "Diagnosing faults in aircraft gas turbine engines is a complex problem. It\ninvolves several tasks, including rapid and accurate interpretation of patterns\nin engine sensor data. We have investigated contextual normalization for the\ndevelopment of a software tool to help engine repair technicians with\ninterpretation of sensor data. Contextual normalization is a new strategy for\nemploying machine learning. It handles variation in data that is due to\ncontextual factors, rather than the health of the engine. It does this by\nnormalizing the data in a context-sensitive manner. This learning strategy was\ndeveloped and tested using 242 observations of an aircraft gas turbine engine\nin a test cell, where each observation consists of roughly 12,000 numbers,\ngathered over a 12 second interval. There were eight classes of observations:\nseven deliberately implanted classes of faults and a healthy class. We compared\ntwo approaches to implementing our learning strategy: linear regression and\ninstance-based learning. We have three main results. (1) For the given problem,\ninstance-based learning works better than linear regression. (2) For this\nproblem, contextual normalization works better than other common forms of\nnormalization. (3) The algorithms described here can be the basis for a useful\nsoftware tool for assisting technicians with the interpretation of sensor data.",

A few papers have investigated the cost of misclassification\nerrors. Very few papers have examined the many other types of cost. In this\npaper, we attempt to create a taxonomy of the different types of cost that are\ninvolved in inductive concept learning.

    "summary": "A large body of research in machine learning is concerned with supervised\nlearning from examples. The examples are typically represented as vectors in a\nmulti-dimensional feature space (also known as attribute-value descriptions). A\nteacher partitions a set of training examples into a finite number of classes.\nThe task of the learning algorithm is to induce a concept from the training\nexamples. In this paper, we formally distinguish three types of features:\nprimary, contextual, and irrelevant features. We also formally define what it\nmeans for one feature to be context-sensitive to another feature.\nContext-sensitive features complicate the task of the learner and potentially\nimpair the learner's performance. Our formal definitions make it possible for a\nlearner to automatically identify context-sensitive features. After\ncontext-sensitive features have been identified, there are several strategies\nthat the learner can employ for managing the features; however, a discussion of\nthese strategies is outside of the scope of this paper. The formal definitions\npresented here correct a flaw in previously proposed definitions. We discuss\nthe relationship between our work and a formal definition of relevance.",

    "title": "An Analytical Piecewise Radial Distortion Model for Precision Camera\n  Calibration",
    "summary": "The common approach to radial distortion is by the means of polynomial\napproximation, which introduces distortion-specific parameters into the camera\nmodel and requires estimation of these distortion parameters. The task of\nestimating radial distortion is to find a radial distortion model that allows\neasy undistortion as well as satisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new\npiecewise radial distortion model with easy analytical undistortion formula.\nThe motivation for seeking a piecewise radial distortion model is that, when a\ncamera is resulted in a low quality during manufacturing, the nonlinear radial\ndistortion can be complex. Using low order polynomials to approximate the\nradial distortion might not be precise enough. On the other hand, higher order\npolynomials suffer from the inverse problem. With the new piecewise radial\ndistortion function, more flexibility is obtained and the radial undistortion\ncan be performed analytically. Experimental results are presented to show that\nwith this new piecewise radial distortion model, better performance is achieved\nthan that using the single function. Furthermore, a comparable performance with\nthe conventional polynomial model using 2 coefficients can also be\naccomplished.",

    "summary": "The commonly used radial distortion model for camera calibration is in fact\nan assumption or a restriction. In practice, camera distortion could happen in\na general geometrical manner that is not limited to the radial sense. This\npaper proposes a simplified geometrical distortion modeling method by using two\ndifferent radial distortion functions in the two image axes. A family of\nsimplified geometric distortion models is proposed, which are either simple\npolynomials or the rational functions of polynomials. Analytical geometric\nundistortion is possible using two of the distortion functions discussed in\nthis paper and their performance can be improved by applying a piecewise\nfitting idea. Our experimental results show that the geometrical distortion\nmodels always perform better than their radial distortion counterparts.\nFurthermore, the proposed geometric modeling method is more appropriate for\ncameras whose distortion is not perfectly radially symmetric around the center\nof distortion.",

No initial assumptions about the topology or orientability of the\ninput surface are made. The theorem is derived from a refinement and\ngeneralization of Van Heijenoort's theorem on locally convex manifolds to\nspherical spaces.

    "summary": "We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method\ndoesn't use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as\nfollows: First, we determine a universal similarity distance, the normalized\ncompression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files\n(singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical\nclustering method. The NCD is universal in that it is not restricted to a\nspecific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A\ntheoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one\nof the authors, is provably optimal but uses the non-computable notion of\nKolmogorov complexity. We propose precise notions of similarity metric, normal\ncompressor, and show that the NCD based on a normal compressor is a similarity\nmetric that approximates universality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from\nthe distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (binary tree) by a new quartet\nmethod and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and\navailable as public software, and is robust under choice of different\ncompressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we\nreport evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics,\nvirology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and\ncombinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical,\ndictionary, and block sorting compressors.

    "summary": "This paper shows how a machine, which observes stimuli through an\nuncharacterized, uncalibrated channel and sensor, can glean machine-independent\ninformation (i.e., channel- and sensor-independent information) about the\nstimuli. First, we demonstrate that a machine defines a specific coordinate\nsystem on the stimulus state space, with the nature of that coordinate system\ndepending on the device's channel and sensor. Thus, machines with different\nchannels and sensors \"see\" the same stimulus trajectory through state space,\nbut in different machine-specific coordinate systems. For a large variety of\nphysical stimuli, statistical properties of that trajectory endow the stimulus\nconfiguration space with differential geometric structure (a metric and\nparallel transfer procedure), which can then be used to represent relative\nstimulus configurations in a coordinate-system-independent manner (and,\ntherefore, in a channel- and sensor-independent manner). The resulting\ndescription is an \"inner\" property of the stimulus time series in the sense\nthat it does not depend on extrinsic factors like the observer's choice of a\ncoordinate system in which the stimulus is viewed (i.e., the observer's choice\nof channel and sensor). This methodology is illustrated with analytic examples\nand with a numerically simulated experiment. In an intelligent sensory device,\nthis kind of representation \"engine\" could function as a \"front-end\" that\npasses channel/sensor-independent stimulus representations to a pattern\nrecognition module. After a pattern recognizer has been trained in one of these\ndevices, it could be used without change in other devices having different\nchannels and sensors.",

    "summary": "The collection of wild larvae seed as a source of raw material is a major sub\nindustry of shellfish aquaculture. To predict when, where and in what\nquantities wild seed will be available, it is necessary to track the appearance\nand growth of planktonic larvae. One of the most difficult groups to identify,\nparticularly at the species level are the Bivalvia. This difficulty arises from\nthe fact that fundamentally all bivalve larvae have a similar shape and colour.\nIdentification based on gross morphological appearance is limited by the\ntime-consuming nature of the microscopic examination and by the limited\navailability of expertise in this field. Molecular and immunological methods\nare also being studied. We describe the application of computational pattern\nrecognition methods to the automated identification and size analysis of\nscallop larvae. For identification, the shape features used are binary\ninvariant moments; that is, the features are invariant to shift (position\nwithin the image), scale (induced either by growth or differential image\nmagnification) and rotation. Images of a sample of scallop and non-scallop\nlarvae covering a range of maturities have been analysed. In order to overcome\nthe automatic identification, as well as to allow the system to receive new\nunknown samples at any moment, a self-organized and unsupervised ant-like\nclustering algorithm based on Swarm Intelligence is proposed, followed by\nsimple k-NNR nearest neighbour classification on the final map. Results achieve\na full recognition rate of 100% under several situations (k =1 or 3).",

In this work, a method is\ndescribed for evolving adaptive procedures for these problems. In many real\nworld applications data clustering constitutes a fundamental issue whenever\nbehavioural or feature domains can be mapped into topological domains.

    "summary": "In the absence of a pure noise-free image it is hard to define what noise is,\nin any original noisy image, and as a consequence also where it is, and in what\namount. In fact, the definition of noise depends largely on our own aim in the\nwhole image analysis process, and (perhaps more important) in our\nself-perception of noise. For instance, when we perceive noise as disconnected\nand small it is normal to use MM-ASF filters to treat it. There is two\nevidences of this. First, in many instances there is no ideal and pure\nnoise-free image to compare our filtering process (nothing but our\nself-perception of its pure image); second, and related with this first point,\nMM transformations that we chose are only based on our self - and perhaps -\nfuzzy notion. The present proposal combines the results of two MM filtering\ntransformations (FT1, FT2) and makes use of some measures and quantitative\nrelations on their Size/Intensity Diagrams to find the most appropriate noise\nremoval process. Results can also be used for finding the most appropriate stop\ncriteria, and the right sequence of MM operators combination on Alternating\nSequential Filters (ASF), if these measures are applied, for instance, on a\nGenetic Algorithm's target function.",

This paper posits a new image information content definition.\nFollowing the theory of Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin's complexity, we define\nimage information content as a set of descriptions of imafe data structures.\nThree levels of such description can be generally distinguished: 1)the global\nlevel, where the coarse structure of the entire scene is initially outlined; 2)\nthe intermediate level, where structures of separate, non-overlapping image\nregions usually associated with individual scene objects are deliniated; and 3)\nthe low-level description, where local image structures observed in a limited\nand restricted field of view are resolved. A technique for creating such image\ninformation content descriptors is developed. Its algorithm is presented and\nelucidated with some examples, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.",

    "summary": "The `Cyborg Astrobiologist' (CA) has undergone a second geological field\ntrial, at a red sandstone site in northern Guadalajara, Spain, near Riba de\nSantiuste. The Cyborg Astrobiologist is a wearable computer and video camera\nsystem that has demonstrated a capability to find uncommon interest points in\ngeological imagery in real-time in the field. The first (of three) geological\nstructures that we studied was an outcrop of nearly homogeneous sandstone,\nwhich exhibits oxidized-iron impurities in red and and an absence of these iron\nimpurities in white. The white areas in these ``red beds'' have turned white\nbecause the iron has been removed by chemical reduction, perhaps by a\nbiological agent. The computer vision system found in one instance several\n(iron-free) white spots to be uncommon and therefore interesting, as well as\nseveral small and dark nodules. The second geological structure contained\nwhite, textured mineral deposits on the surface of the sandstone, which were\nfound by the CA to be interesting. The third geological structure was a 50 cm\nthick paleosol layer, with fossilized root structures of some plants, which\nwere found by the CA to be interesting. A quasi-blind comparison of the Cyborg\nAstrobiologist's interest points for these images with the interest points\ndetermined afterwards by a human geologist shows that the Cyborg Astrobiologist\nconcurred with the human geologist 68% of the time (true positive rate), with a\n32% false positive rate and a 32% false negative rate.\n  (abstract has been abridged).",

In this paper,\nwe study one of the more general problems, known as LCP (largest common point\nset problem): Let $\\PP$ and $\\QQ$ be two point sets in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and let\n$\\epsilon \\geq 0$ be a tolerance parameter, the problem is to find a rigid\nmotion $\\mu$ that maximizes the cardinality of subset $\\II$ of $Q$, such that\nthe Hausdorff distance $\\distance(\\PP,\\mu(\\II)) \\leq \\epsilon$. We denote the\nsize of the optimal solution to the above problem by $\\LCP(P,Q)$. The problem\nis called exact-LCP for $\\epsilon=0$, and \\tolerant-LCP when $\\epsilon>0$ and\nthe minimum interpoint distance is greater than $2\\epsilon$. A\n$\\beta$-distance-approximation algorithm for tolerant-LCP finds a subset $I\n\\subseteq \\QQ$ such that $|I|\\geq \\LCP(P,Q)$ and $\\distance(\\PP,\\mu(\\II)) \\leq\n\\beta \\epsilon$ for some $\\beta \\ge 1$.\n  This paper has three main contributions. (1) We introduce a new algorithm,\ncalled {\\DA}, which gives the fastest known deterministic\n4-distance-approximation algorithm for \\tolerant-LCP. (2) For the exact-LCP,\nwhen the matched set is required to be large, we give a simple sampling\nstrategy that improves the running times of all known deterministic algorithms,\nyielding the fastest known deterministic algorithm for this problem. (3) We use\nexpander graphs to speed-up the \\DA algorithm for \\tolerant-LCP when the size\nof the matched set is required to be large, at the expense of approximation in\nthe matched set size.

The Cyborg\nAstrobiologist platform has thus far been used for testing and development of\nthese algorithms and systems: robotic acquisition of quasi-mosaics of images,\nreal-time image segmentation, and real-time determination of interesting points\nin the image mosaics. This work is more of a test of the whole system, rather\nthan of any one part of the system. However, beyond the concept of the system\nitself, the uncommon map (despite its simplicity) is the main innovative part\nof the system. The uncommon map helps to determine interest-points in a\ncontext-free manner. Overall, the hardware and software systems function\nreliably, and the computer-vision algorithms are adequate for the first field\ntests. In addition to the proof-of-concept aspect of these field tests, the\nmain result of these field tests is the enumeration of those issues that we can\nimprove in the future, including: dealing with structural shadow and\nmicrotexture, and also, controlling the camera's zoom lens in an intelligent\nmanner. Nonetheless, despite these and other technical inadequacies, this\nCyborg Astrobiologist system, consisting of a camera-equipped wearable-computer\nand its computer-vision algorithms, has demonstrated its ability of finding\ngenuinely interesting points in real-time in the geological scenery, and then\ngathering more information about these interest points in an automated manner.\nWe use these capabilities for autonomous guidance towards geological\npoints-of-interest.",

In this paper, a more flexible nonparametric\nmodel for distributed regression is considered that is applicable in a variety\nof WSN applications including field estimation. Here, starting with the\nstandard regularized kernel least-squares estimator, a message-passing\nalgorithm for distributed estimation in WSNs is derived.

We consider the case of deterministically defined labels.\nTraditionally, this task is studied under the assumption that examples are\nindependent and identically distributed.

Generally image understanding assumes interplay of two\nsub-processes: image information content discovery and image information\ncontent interpretation. Despite of its widespread use, the notion of \"image\ninformation content\" is still ill defined, intuitive, and ambiguous. Most\noften, it is used in the Shannon's sense, which means information content\nassessment averaged over the whole signal ensemble. Humans, however,rarely\nresort to such estimates. They are very effective in decomposing images into\ntheir meaningful constituents and focusing attention to the perceptually\nrelevant image parts. We posit that following the latest findings in human\nattention vision studies and the concepts of Kolmogorov's complexity theory an\nunorthodox segmentation approach can be proposed that provides effective image\ndecomposition to information preserving image fragments well suited for\nsubsequent image interpretation. We provide some illustrative examples,\ndemonstrating effectiveness of this approach.",

Polar frequency descriptors are extracted from face\nimages by Fourier-Bessel transform (FBT). Next, the Euclidean distance between\nall images is computed and each image is now represented by its dissimilarity\nto the other images. A Pseudo-Fisher Linear Discriminant was built on this\ndissimilarity space. The performance of Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)\ndescriptors, and a combination of both feature types was also evaluated. The\nalgorithms were tested on a 40- and 1196-subjects face database (ORL and FERET,\nrespectively). With 5 images per subject in the training and test datasets,\nerror rate on the ORL database was 3.8, 1.25 and 0.2% for the FBT, DFT, and the\ncombined classifier, respectively, as compared to 2.6% achieved by the best\nprevious algorithm. The most informative polar frequency features were\nconcentrated at low-to-medium angular frequencies coupled to low radial\nfrequencies. On the FERET database, where an affine normalization\npre-processing was applied, the FBT algorithm outperformed only the PCA in a\nrank recognition test.

The Morlet wavelet is capable of\ntuning to specific frequencies, thus allowing noise filtering and vessel\nenhancement in a single step. We use a Bayesian classifier with\nclass-conditional probability density functions (likelihoods) described as\nGaussian mixtures, yielding a fast classification, while being able to model\ncomplex decision surfaces and compare its performance with the linear minimum\nsquared error classifier. The probability distributions are estimated based on\na training set of labeled pixels obtained from manual segmentations. The\nmethod's performance is evaluated on publicly available DRIVE and STARE\ndatabases of manually labeled non-mydriatic images. On the DRIVE database, it\nachieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of\n0.9598, being slightly superior than that presented by the method of Staal et\nal.",

    "summary": "Image superresolution involves the processing of an image sequence to\ngenerate a still image with higher resolution. Classical approaches, such as\nbayesian MAP methods, require iterative minimization procedures, with high\ncomputational costs. Recently, the authors proposed a method to tackle this\nproblem, based on the use of a hybrid MLP-PNN architecture. In this paper, we\npresent a novel superresolution method, based on an evolution of this concept,\nto incorporate the use of local image models. A neural processing stage\nreceives as input the value of model coefficients on local windows. The data\ndimensionality is firstly reduced by application of PCA. An MLP, trained on\nsynthetic sequences with various amounts of noise, estimates the\nhigh-resolution image data. The effect of varying the dimension of the network\ninput space is examined, showing a complex, structured behavior.

The system receives as input a silhouette of the vessel to be\nidentified, previously extracted from a side view of the object. This view\ncould have been acquired with imaging sensors operating at different spectral\nranges (CCD, FLIR, image intensifier). The input silhouette is preprocessed and\ncompared to those stored in a database, retrieving a small number of potential\nmatches ranked by their similarity to the target silhouette. This set of\npotential matches is presented to the system operator, who makes the final ship\nidentification. This system makes use of an evolved version of the Curvature\nScale Space (CSS) representation. In the proposed approach, it is curvature\nextrema, instead of zero crossings, that are tracked during silhouette\nevolution, hence improving robustness and enabling to cope successfully with\ncases where the standard CCS representation is found to be unstable. Also, the\nuse of local curvature was replaced with the more robust concept of lobe\nconcavity, with significant additional gains in performance. Experimental\nresults on actual operational imagery prove the excellent performance and\nrobustness of the developed method.",

    "summary": "We present a novel approach to semi-supervised learning which is based on\nstatistical physics. Most of the former work in the field of semi-supervised\nlearning classifies the points by minimizing a certain energy function, which\ncorresponds to a minimal k-way cut solution. In contrast to these methods, we\nestimate the distribution of classifications, instead of the sole minimal k-way\ncut, which yields more accurate and robust results. Our approach may be applied\nto all energy functions used for semi-supervised learning. The method is based\non sampling using a Multicanonical Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm, and has\na straightforward probabilistic interpretation, which allows for soft\nassignments of points to classes, and also to cope with yet unseen class types.\nThe suggested approach is demonstrated on a toy data set and on two real-life\ndata sets of gene expression.",

Segmentation\norganizes time series into few intervals having uniform characteristics\n(flatness, linearity, modality, monotonicity and so on). For scalability, we\nrequire fast linear time algorithms. The popular piecewise linear model can\ndetermine where the data goes up or down and at what rate. Unfortunately, when\nthe data does not follow a linear model, the computation of the local slope\ncreates overfitting. We propose an adaptive time series model where the\npolynomial degree of each interval vary (constant, linear and so on). Given a\nnumber of regressors, the cost of each interval is its polynomial degree:\nconstant intervals cost 1 regressor, linear intervals cost 2 regressors, and so\non. Our goal is to minimize the Euclidean (l_2) error for a given model\ncomplexity. Experimentally, we investigate the model where intervals can be\neither constant or linear. Over synthetic random walks, historical stock market\nprices, and electrocardiograms, the adaptive model provides a more accurate\nsegmentation than the piecewise linear model without increasing the\ncross-validation error or the running time, while providing a richer vocabulary\nto applications.

Based on recent works and in\nparticular the one of Darbon and Sigelle, we justify the equivalence of the\nshape optimization problem and a weighted total variation regularization. For\nsolving this problem, we adapt the projection algorithm proposed recently for\nsolving the basic TV regularization problem. Another solution to the shape\noptimization investigated here is the graph cut technique. Both methods have\nthe advantage to lead to a global minimum. Since we can distinguish moving\nobjects from static elements of a scene by analyzing norm of the optical flow\nvectors, we choose the optical flow norm as initial data. In order to have the\ncontour as close as possible to an edge in the image, we use a classical edge\ndetector function as the weight of the weighted total variation. This model has\nbeen used in one of our former works. We also apply the same methods to a video\nsegmentation model used by Jehan-Besson, Barlaud and Aubert. In this case, only\nstandard perimeter is incorporated in the shape functional.

These kernels elaborate\non the well known Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) family of distances by considering\nthe same set of elementary operations, namely substitutions and repetitions of\ntokens, to map a sequence onto another. Associating to each of these operations\na given score, DTW algorithms use dynamic programming techniques to compute an\noptimal sequence of operations with high overall score. In this paper we\nconsider instead the score spanned by all possible alignments, take a smoothed\nversion of their maximum and derive a kernel out of this formulation. We prove\nthat this kernel is positive definite under favorable conditions and show how\nit can be tuned effectively for practical applications as we report encouraging\nresults on a speech recognition task.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a global method for estimating the motion of a\ncamera which films a static scene. Our approach is direct, fast and robust, and\ndeals with adjacent frames of a sequence. It is based on a quadratic\napproximation of the deformation between two images, in the case of a scene\nwith constant depth in the camera coordinate system. This condition is very\nrestrictive but we show that provided translation and depth inverse variations\nare small enough, the error on optical flow involved by the approximation of\ndepths by a constant is small. In this context, we propose a new model of\ncamera motion, that allows to separate the image deformation in a similarity\nand a ``purely'' projective application, due to change of optical axis\ndirection. This model leads to a quadratic approximation of image deformation\nthat we estimate with an M-estimator; we can immediatly deduce camera motion\nparameters.",

    "summary": "Many image processing problems involve identifying the region in the image\ndomain occupied by a given entity in the scene. Automatic solution of these\nproblems requires models that incorporate significant prior knowledge about the\nshape of the region. Many methods for including such knowledge run into\ndifficulties when the topology of the region is unknown a priori, for example\nwhen the entity is composed of an unknown number of similar objects.\nHigher-order active contours (HOACs) represent one method for the modelling of\nnon-trivial prior knowledge about shape without necessarily constraining region\ntopology, via the inclusion of non-local interactions between region boundary\npoints in the energy defining the model. The case of an unknown number of\ncircular objects arises in a number of domains, e.g. medical, biological,\nnanotechnological, and remote sensing imagery. Regions composed of an a priori\nunknown number of circles may be referred to as a `gas of circles'. In this\nreport, we present a HOAC model of a `gas of circles'. In order to guarantee\nstable circles, we conduct a stability analysis via a functional Taylor\nexpansion of the HOAC energy around a circular shape. This analysis fixes one\nof the model parameters in terms of the others and constrains the rest. In\nconjunction with a suitable likelihood energy, we apply the model to the\nextraction of tree crowns from aerial imagery, and show that the new model\noutperforms other techniques.",

How to reconstruct such functions from a small number of measurements?\n  The stress is on a comparison of linear and non-linear approaches. As a model\ncase we use piecewise-constant functions on [0,1], in particular, the Heaviside\njump function. Considered as a curve in the Hilbert space, it is completely\ncharacterized by the fact that any two its disjoint chords are orthogonal. We\nreinterpret this fact in a context of step-functions in one or two variables.\n  Next we study the limitations on representability and reconstruction of\npiecewise-constant functions by linear and semi-linear methods. Our main tools\nin this problem are Kolmogorov's n-width and entropy, as well as Temlyakov's\n(N,m)-width.\n  On the positive side, we show that a very accurate non-linear reconstruction\nis possible. It goes through a solution of certain specific non-linear systems\nof algebraic equations. We discuss the form of these systems and methods of\ntheir solution, stressing their relation to Moment Theory and Complex Analysis.\n  Finally, we informally discuss two problems in Computer Imaging which are\nparallel to the problems 1 and 2 above: compression of still images and\nvideo-sequences on one side, and image reconstruction from indirect measurement\n(for example, in Computer Tomography), on the other.",

    "summary": "This paper explores a comparative study of both the linear and kernel\nimplementations of three of the most popular Appearance-based Face Recognition\nprojection classes, these being the methodologies of Principal Component\nAnalysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Independent Component Analysis. The\nexperimental procedure provides a platform of equal working conditions and\nexamines the ten algorithms in the categories of expression, illumination,\nocclusion and temporal delay. The results are then evaluated based on a\nsequential combination of assessment tools that facilitate both intuitive and\nstatistical decisiveness among the intra and interclass comparisons. The best\ncategorical algorithms are then incorporated into a hybrid methodology, where\nthe advantageous effects of fusion strategies are considered.",

An error function is created to measure\nthe correspondence of the template to the image. The problem presented here is\nto optimise the horizontal, vertical and scaling parameters that register the\ntemplate with the scene. The Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing and\nParticle Swarm Optimisations are compared to a Nelder-Mead Simplex optimisation\nwith starting points chosen in a pre-processing stage. The paper investigates\nthe precision and accuracy of each method and shows that all four methods\nperform favourably for image registration. SA is the most precise, GA is the\nmost accurate. PSO is a good mix of both and the Simplex method returns local\nminima the most. A pre-processing stage should be investigated for the\nevolutionary methods in order to improve performance. Discrete versions of the\noptimisation methods should be investigated to further improve computational\nperformance.",

    "summary": "We consider the problem of sequential decision making on random fields\ncorrupted by noise. In this scenario, the decision maker observes a noisy\nversion of the data, yet judged with respect to the clean data. In particular,\nwe first consider the problem of sequentially scanning and filtering noisy\nrandom fields. In this case, the sequential filter is given the freedom to\nchoose the path over which it traverses the random field (e.g., noisy image or\nvideo sequence), thus it is natural to ask what is the best achievable\nperformance and how sensitive this performance is to the choice of the scan. We\nformally define the problem of scanning and filtering, derive a bound on the\nbest achievable performance and quantify the excess loss occurring when\nnon-optimal scanners are used, compared to optimal scanning and filtering.\n  We then discuss the problem of sequential scanning and prediction of noisy\nrandom fields. This setting is a natural model for applications such as\nrestoration and coding of noisy images. We formally define the problem of\nscanning and prediction of a noisy multidimensional array and relate the\noptimal performance to the clean scandictability defined by Merhav and\nWeissman. Moreover, bounds on the excess loss due to sub-optimal scans are\nderived, and a universal prediction algorithm is suggested.\n  This paper is the second part of a two-part paper. The first paper dealt with\nsequential decision making on noiseless data arrays, namely, when the decision\nmaker is judged with respect to the same data array it observes.",

Fault classification was accomplished by implementing a series of\nvirtual sensor models which used data from real sensors (Lam Station sensors,\nOptical Emission Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring) to predict recipe setpoints\nand wafer state characteristics. Fault detection and classification were\nperformed by comparing predicted recipe and wafer state values with expected\nvalues. Models utilized include linear PLS, Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network\nPLS. Prediction of recipe setpoints based upon sensor data provides a\ncapability for cross-checking that the machine is maintaining the desired\nsetpoints. Wafer state characteristics such as Line Width Reduction and\nRemaining Oxide were estimated on-line using these same process sensors (Lam,\nOES, RFM). Wafer-to-wafer measurement of these characteristics in a production\nsetting (where typically this information may be only sparsely available, if at\nall, after batch processing runs with numerous wafers have been completed)\nwould provide important information to the operator that the process is or is\nnot producing wafers within acceptable bounds of product quality.

Based on such a representation, this\npaper further presents a supervised learning methodology of semantics\nassociated to spatio-temporal patterns occurring in satellite image sequences.\nIt enables the recognition and the probabilistic retrieval of similar events.\nIndeed, graphs are attached to statistical models for spatio-temporal\nprocesses, which at their turn describe physical changes in the observed scene.\nTherefore, we adjust a parametric model evaluating similarity types between\ngraph patterns in order to represent user-specific semantics attached to\nspatio-temporal phenomena. The learning step is performed by the incremental\ndefinition of similarity types via user-provided spatio-temporal pattern\nexamples attached to positive or/and negative semantics. From these examples,\nprobabilities are inferred using a Bayesian network and a Dirichlet model. This\nenables to links user interest to a specific similarity model between graph\npatterns. According to the current state of learning, semantic posterior\nprobabilities are updated for all possible graph patterns so that similar\nspatio-temporal phenomena can be recognized and retrieved from the image\nsequence. Few experiments performed on a multi-spectral SPOT image sequence\nillustrate the proposed spatio-temporal recognition method.",

    "summary": "A recent paper \\cite{CaeCaeSchBar06} proposed a provably optimal, polynomial\ntime method for performing near-isometric point pattern matching by means of\nexact probabilistic inference in a chordal graphical model. Their fundamental\nresult is that the chordal graph in question is shown to be globally rigid,\nimplying that exact inference provides the same matching solution as exact\ninference in a complete graphical model. This implies that the algorithm is\noptimal when there is no noise in the point patterns. In this paper, we present\na new graph which is also globally rigid but has an advantage over the graph\nproposed in \\cite{CaeCaeSchBar06}: its maximal clique size is smaller,\nrendering inference significantly more efficient. However, our graph is not\nchordal and thus standard Junction Tree algorithms cannot be directly applied.\nNevertheless, we show that loopy belief propagation in such a graph converges\nto the optimal solution. This allows us to retain the optimality guarantee in\nthe noiseless case, while substantially reducing both memory requirements and\nprocessing time. Our experimental results show that the accuracy of the\nproposed solution is indistinguishable from that of \\cite{CaeCaeSchBar06} when\nthere is noise in the point patterns.",

It is conclusive that\nflies could contribute a certain amount of neuromatrices indicating an imagery\nfunction of a visual-computational system into computer graphics and storage\nsystems. The visual system involves the time aspect, whereas flies possess\nfaster pulses compared to humans' visual ability due to the E-field state on an\nactive fly's eye surface. This behaviour can be tested on a dissected fly\nspecimen at its ommatidia. Electro-optical contacts and electrodes are wired\nthrough the flesh forming organic emitter layer to stimulate light emission,\nthereby to a computer circuit. The next step is applying a threshold voltage\nwith secondary voltages to the circuit denoting an array of essential\nelectrodes for bit switch. As a result, circuit's dormant pulses versus active\npulses at the specimen's area are recorded. The outcome matrix possesses a\nconstruction of RGB and time radicals expressing the time problem in\nconsumption, allocating time into computational algorithms, enhancing the\ntechnology far beyond. The obtained formulation generates consumed distance\ncons(x), denoting circuital travel between data source/sink for pixel data and\nbendable wavelengths.

Bit strings\nderived from speckle can be used for a variety of security purposes such as\nidentification, authentication, anti-counterfeiting, secure key storage, random\nnumber generation and tamper protection. The choice of laser speckle as a\nsource of random keys is quite natural, given the chaotic properties of\nspeckle. However, this same chaotic behaviour also causes reproducibility\nproblems. Cryptographic protocols require either zero noise or very low noise\nin their inputs; hence the issue of error rates is critical to applications of\nlaser speckle in cryptography. Most of the literature uses an error reduction\nmethod based on Gabor filtering. Though the method is successful, it has not\nbeen thoroughly analysed.\n  In this paper we present a statistical analysis of Gabor-filtered speckle\npatterns. We introduce a model in which perturbations are described as random\nphase changes in the source plane. Using this model we compute the second and\nfourth order statistics of Gabor coefficients.

The general aim of this addendum is to present a\nrefined text of Sections 1-3 of that proposal and highlighting the contents of\nits Appendix in form of a `Mechanisms' Section. We then briefly remind in an\narticle aimed for December 2007, by appending two more equations into Section\n3, a theoretical II-time scenario as a time model well-proposed for the\nphenomenon. The time model within the core of the proposal, plays a significant\nrole in emphasizing the principle points on Objectives no. 1-8, Sub-hypothesis\n3.1.2, mentioned in Article [arXiv:0710.0410].

Samples of\nthe plenoptic function (POF) are seen in video and in general visual content,\nand represent large amounts of information. In this paper we propose a\nstochastic model to study the compression limits of the plenoptic function. In\nthe proposed framework, we isolate the two fundamental sources of information\nin the POF: the one representing the camera motion and the other representing\nthe information complexity of the \"reality\" being acquired and transmitted. The\nsources of information are combined, generating a stochastic process that we\nstudy in detail. We first propose a model for ensembles of realities that do\nnot change over time. The proposed model is simple in that it enables us to\nderive precise coding bounds in the information-theoretic sense that are sharp\nin a number of cases of practical interest. For this simple case of static\nrealities and camera motion, our results indicate that coding practice is in\naccordance with optimal coding from an information-theoretic standpoint. The\nmodel is further extended to account for visual realities that change over\ntime. We derive bounds on the lossless and lossy information rates for this\ndynamic reality model, stating conditions under which the bounds are tight.\nExamples with synthetic sources suggest that in the presence of scene dynamics,\nsimple hybrid coding using motion/displacement estimation with DPCM performs\nconsiderably suboptimally relative to the true rate-distortion bound.",

It allows a representation of a\ngeneral class of objects including geometric patterns and images in a sparse,\nmodular, hierarchical, and recursive manner. The representation can exploit any\ncomputable regularity in objects to compactly describe them, while also being\ncapable of representing random objects as raw data. A set of rules uniformly\ndictates the interpretation of the representation into raw signal, which makes\nit possible to ask what pattern a given raw signal contains. Also, it allows\nsimple separation of the information that we wish to ignore from that which we\nmeasure, by using a set of maps to delineate the a priori parts of the objects,\nleaving only the information in the structure.\n  Using the representation, we introduce a measure of information in general\nobjects relative to structures defined by the set of maps. We point out that\nthe common prescription of encoding objects by strings to use Kolmogorov\ncomplexity is meaningless when, as often is the case, the encoding is not\nspecified in any way other than that it exists. Noting this, we define the\nmeasure directly in terms of the structures of the spaces in which the objects\nreside. As a result, the measure is defined relative to a set of maps that\ncharacterize the structures.

    "summary": "In this paper, we present a Mirroring Neural Network architecture to perform\nnon-linear dimensionality reduction and Object Recognition using a reduced\nlowdimensional characteristic vector. In addition to dimensionality reduction,\nthe network also reconstructs (mirrors) the original high-dimensional input\nvector from the reduced low-dimensional data. The Mirroring Neural Network\narchitecture has more number of processing elements (adalines) in the outer\nlayers and the least number of elements in the central layer to form a\nconverging-diverging shape in its configuration. Since this network is able to\nreconstruct the original image from the output of the innermost layer (which\ncontains all the information about the input pattern), these outputs can be\nused as object signature to classify patterns. The network is trained to\nminimize the discrepancy between actual output and the input by back\npropagating the mean squared error from the output layer to the input layer.\nAfter successfully training the network, it can reduce the dimension of input\nvectors and mirror the patterns fed to it. The Mirroring Neural Network\narchitecture gave very good results on various test patterns.",

    "summary": "Segmentation algorithms based on an energy minimisation framework often\ndepend on a scale parameter which balances a fit to data and a regularising\nterm. Irregular pyramids are defined as a stack of graphs successively reduced.\nWithin this framework, the scale is often defined implicitly as the height in\nthe pyramid. However, each level of an irregular pyramid can not usually be\nreadily associated to the global optimum of an energy or a global criterion on\nthe base level graph. This last drawback is addressed by the scale set\nframework designed by Guigues. The methods designed by this author allow to\nbuild a hierarchy and to design cuts within this hierarchy which globally\nminimise an energy. This paper studies the influence of the construction scheme\nof the initial hierarchy on the resulting optimal cuts. We propose one\nsequential and one parallel method with two variations within both. Our\nsequential methods provide partitions near the global optima while parallel\nmethods require less execution times than the sequential method of Guigues even\non sequential machines.",

Using the type-covering lemma, this new\nrate-distortion function is determined to be the maximum of the IID\nrate-distortion function over a set of source distributions attainable by the\nadversary. We then extend the results to allow for partial or noisy\nobservations of subsource realizations.

The bound is used to give\na sufficient number of distributions that need to be sampled to compute the\nrate-distortion function of an AVS to within a certain accuracy.

We therefore construct an\napproximation of the concave problem solution by following a solution path of a\nconvex-concave problem obtained by linear interpolation of the convex and\nconcave formulations, starting from the convex relaxation. This method allows\nto easily integrate the information on graph label similarities into the\noptimization problem, and therefore to perform labeled weighted graph matching.\nThe algorithm is compared with some of the best performing graph matching\nmethods on four datasets: simulated graphs, QAPLib, retina vessel images and\nhandwritten chinese characters.

In the end, we extend the above method to more general case in\norder to compare it with the famous Mumford-Shah method that uses variational\nprinciple and geometric measure.",

The approach considers each\ndata item as an ant, which moves inside a grid changing the cells it goes\nthrough, in a fashion similar to Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps. The resulting\nalgorithm is conceptually more simple, takes less free parameters than other\nant-based clustering algorithms, and, after some parameter tuning, yields very\ngood results on some benchmark problems.",

    "summary": "This work describes a novel methodology for automatic contour extraction from\n2D images of 3D neurons (e.g. camera lucida images and other types of 2D\nmicroscopy). Most contour-based shape analysis methods can not be used to\ncharacterize such cells because of overlaps between neuronal processes. The\nproposed framework is specifically aimed at the problem of contour following\neven in presence of multiple overlaps. First, the input image is preprocessed\nin order to obtain an 8-connected skeleton with one-pixel-wide branches, as\nwell as a set of critical regions (i.e., bifurcations and crossings). Next, for\neach subtree, the tracking stage iteratively labels all valid pixel of\nbranches, up to a critical region, where it determines the suitable direction\nto proceed. Finally, the labeled skeleton segments are followed in order to\nyield the parametric contour of the neuronal shape under analysis. The reported\nsystem was successfully tested with respect to several images and the results\nfrom a set of three neuron images are presented here, each pertaining to a\ndifferent class, i.e. alpha, delta and epsilon ganglion cells, containing a\ntotal of 34 crossings. The algorithms successfully got across all these\noverlaps. The method has also been found to exhibit robustness even for images\nwith close parallel segments. The proposed method is robust and may be\nimplemented in an efficient manner. The introduction of this approach should\npave the way for more systematic application of contour-based shape analysis\nmethods in neuronal morphology.",

    "summary": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders that greatly impair\npatient' daily lives. Traditional epileptic diagnosis relies on tedious visual\nscreening by neurologists from lengthy EEG recording that requires the presence\nof seizure (ictal) activities. Nowadays, there are many systems helping the\nneurologists to quickly find interesting segments of the lengthy signal by\nautomatic seizure detection. However, we notice that it is very difficult, if\nnot impossible, to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure activities for\nepilepsy patients in areas lack of medical resources and trained neurologists.\nTherefore, we propose to study automated epileptic diagnosis using interictal\nEEG data that is much easier to collect than ictal data. The authors are not\naware of any report on automated EEG diagnostic system that can accurately\ndistinguish patients' interictal EEG from the EEG of normal people. The\nresearch presented in this paper, therefore, aims to develop an automated\ndiagnostic system that can use interictal EEG data to diagnose whether the\nperson is epileptic. Such a system should also detect seizure activities for\nfurther investigation by doctors and potential patient monitoring. To develop\nsuch a system, we extract four classes of features from the EEG data and build\na Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) fed with these features. Leave-one-out\ncross-validation (LOO-CV) on a widely used epileptic-normal data set reflects\nan impressive 99.5% accuracy of our system on distinguishing normal people's\nEEG from patient's interictal EEG. We also find our system can be used in\npatient monitoring (seizure detection) and seizure focus localization, with\n96.7% and 77.5% accuracy respectively on the data set.",

The natural pseudo-distance is a dissimilarity measure between\nshapes, where a shape is viewed as a topological space endowed with a\nreal-valued continuous function. Measuring dissimilarity amounts to minimizing\nthe change in the functions due to the application of homeomorphisms between\ntopological spaces, with respect to the $L_\\infty$-norm. In order to obtain the\nlower bound, a suitable metric between size functions, called matching\ndistance, is introduced. It compares size functions by solving an optimal\nmatching problem between countable point sets. The matching distance is shown\nto be resistant to perturbations, implying that it is always smaller than the\nnatural pseudo-distance. We also prove that the lower bound so obtained is\nsharp and cannot be improved by any other distance between size functions.",

Appearance features are taken\ninto account as object attributes and structural properties are expressed as\nrelational attributes. To cope with possible topological differences between\nboth graphs, a new structure called the deformation graph is introduced. The\nsegmentation process corresponds to finding a labelling of the input graph that\nminimizes the deformations introduced in the model when it is updated with\ninput information. This approach has shown to be faster than other segmentation\nmethods, with competitive output quality. Therefore, the method solves the\nproblem of multiple label segmentation in an efficient way.

The search pattern should be designed to fit the motion\nvector probability (MVP) distribution characteristics of the real-world\nsequences. In this paper, we build a directional model of MVP distribution to\ndescribe the directional-center-biased characteristic of the MVP distribution\nand the directional characteristics of the conditional MVP distribution more\nexactly based on the detailed statistical data of motion vectors of eighteen\npopular sequences. Three directional search patterns are firstly designed by\nutilizing the directional characteristics and they are the smallest search\npatterns among the popular ones.

    "summary": "Each year, numerous segmentation and classification algorithms are invented\nor reused to solve problems where machine vision is needed. Generally, the\nefficiency of these algorithms is compared against the results given by one or\nmany human experts. However, in many situations, the location of the real\nboundaries of the objects as well as their classes are not known with certainty\nby the human experts. Furthermore, only one aspect of the segmentation and\nclassification problem is generally evaluated. In this paper we present a new\nevaluation method for classification and segmentation of image, where we take\ninto account both the classification and segmentation results as well as the\nlevel of certainty given by the experts. As a concrete example of our method,\nwe evaluate an automatic seabed characterization algorithm based on sonar\nimages.",

    "summary": "We propose a robust classification algorithm for curves in 2D and 3D, under\nthe special and full groups of affine transformations. To each plane or spatial\ncurve we assign a plane signature curve. Curves, equivalent under an affine\ntransformation, have the same signature. The signatures introduced in this\npaper are based on integral invariants, which behave much better on noisy\nimages than classically known differential invariants. The comparison with\nother types of invariants is given in the introduction. Though the integral\ninvariants for planar curves were known before, the affine integral invariants\nfor spatial curves are proposed here for the first time. Using the inductive\nvariation of the moving frame method we compute affine invariants in terms of\nEuclidean invariants. We present two types of signatures, the global signature\nand the local signature. Both signatures are independent of parameterization\n(curve sampling). The global signature depends on the choice of the initial\npoint and does not allow us to compare fragments of curves, and is therefore\nsensitive to occlusions. The local signature, although is slightly more\nsensitive to noise, is independent of the choice of the initial point and is\nnot sensitive to occlusions in an image. It helps establish local equivalence\nof curves. The robustness of these invariants and signatures in their\napplication to the problem of classification of noisy spatial curves extracted\nfrom a 3D object is analyzed.",

In graph matching, patterns are modeled as graphs and pattern\nrecognition amounts to finding a correspondence between the nodes of different\ngraphs. Many formulations of this problem can be cast in general as a quadratic\nassignment problem, where a linear term in the objective function encodes node\ncompatibility and a quadratic term encodes edge compatibility. The main\nresearch focus in this theme is about designing efficient algorithms for\napproximately solving the quadratic assignment problem, since it is NP-hard. In\nthis paper we turn our attention to a different question: how to estimate\ncompatibility functions such that the solution of the resulting graph matching\nproblem best matches the expected solution that a human would manually provide.\nWe present a method for learning graph matching: the training examples are\npairs of graphs and the `labels' are matches between them. Our experimental\nresults reveal that learning can substantially improve the performance of\nstandard graph matching algorithms. In particular, we find that simple linear\nassignment with such a learning scheme outperforms Graduated Assignment with\nbistochastic normalisation, a state-of-the-art quadratic assignment relaxation\nalgorithm.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a simple, generic and robust method to extract the grains\nfrom experimental tridimensionnal images of granular materials obtained by\nX-ray tomography. This extraction has two steps: segmentation and splitting.\nFor the segmentation step, if there is a sufficient contrast between the\ndifferent components, a classical threshold procedure followed by a succession\nof morphological filters can be applied. If not, and if the boundary needs to\nbe localized precisely, a watershed transformation controlled by labels is\napplied. The basement of this transformation is to localize a label included in\nthe component and another label in the component complementary. A \"soft\"\nthreshold following by an opening is applied on the initial image to localize a\nlabel in a component. For any segmentation procedure, the visualisation shows a\nproblem: some groups of two grains, close one to each other, become connected.\nSo if a classical cluster procedure is applied on the segmented binary image,\nthese numerical connected grains are considered as a single grain. To overcome\nthis problem, we applied a procedure introduced by L. Vincent in 1993. This\ngrains extraction is tested for various complexes porous media and granular\nmaterial, to predict various properties (diffusion, electrical conductivity,\ndeformation field) in a good agreement with experiment data.",

If we can extract data from these images automatically and\nstore them in a database, an end-user can query and combine data from multiple\ndigital documents simultaneously and efficiently. We propose a framework based\non image analysis and machine learning to extract information from 2-D plot\nimages and store them in a database. The proposed algorithm identifies a 2-D\nplot and extracts the axis labels, legend and the data points from the 2-D\nplot. We also segregate overlapping shapes that correspond to different data\npoints. We demonstrate performance of individual algorithms, using a\ncombination of generated and real-life images.",

The repeatability is importand\nbecause the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features\nwhich correspond to the same real-world 3D locations [Schmid et al 2000]. The\nefficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined\nwith further processing can operate at frame rate.\n  Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic\nfor feature detection, and using machine learning we derive a feature detector\nfrom this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5% of the\navailable processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even\noperate at frame rate (Harris detector 115%, SIFT 195%). Second, we generalize\nthe detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss\nof efficiency. Third, we carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors\nbased on the above repeatability criterion applied to 3D scenes. We show that\ndespite being principally constructed for speed, on these stringent tests, our\nheuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors.\nFinally, the comparison demonstrates that using machine learning produces\nsignificant improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both\nvery fast and very high quality.",

The method is based on transforming the\nedgels of the distorted image to a 1-D angular Hough space, and optimizing the\ndistortion correction parameters which minimize the entropy of the\ncorresponding normalized histogram. Properly corrected imagery will have fewer\ncurved lines, and therefore less spread in Hough space.

We use this to build an\nargument for a data driven approach which merely searches for a good linear\nseparator in the feature space, without further assumptions on the domain or a\nspecific problem.\n  We present such an approach - a sparse network of linear separators,\nutilizing the Winnow learning algorithm - and show how to use it in a variety\nof ambiguity resolution problems. The learning approach presented is\nattribute-efficient and, therefore, appropriate for domains having very large\nnumber of attributes.\n  In particular, we present an extensive experimental comparison of our\napproach with other methods on several well studied lexical disambiguation\ntasks such as context-sensitive spelling correction, prepositional phrase\nattachment and part of speech tagging. In all cases we show that our approach\neither outperforms other methods tried for these tasks or performs comparably\nto the best.",

    "summary": "We show that in language learning, contrary to received wisdom, keeping\nexceptional training instances in memory can be beneficial for generalization\naccuracy. We investigate this phenomenon empirically on a selection of\nbenchmark natural language processing tasks: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion,\npart-of-speech tagging, prepositional-phrase attachment, and base noun phrase\nchunking. In a first series of experiments we combine memory-based learning\nwith training set editing techniques, in which instances are edited based on\ntheir typicality and class prediction strength. Results show that editing\nexceptional instances (with low typicality or low class prediction strength)\ntends to harm generalization accuracy. In a second series of experiments we\ncompare memory-based learning and decision-tree learning methods on the same\nselection of tasks, and find that decision-tree learning often performs worse\nthan memory-based learning. Moreover, the decrease in performance can be linked\nto the degree of abstraction from exceptions (i.e., pruning or eagerness). We\nprovide explanations for both results in terms of the properties of the natural\nlanguage processing tasks and the learning algorithms.",

The model is unusual in\nthat it treats the generation of a complete corpus, regardless of length, as a\nsingle event in the probability space.

This chapter provides an\nanalytical framework to quantify the improvements in classification results due\nto combining. The results apply to both linear combiners and order statistics\ncombiners. We first show that to a first order approximation, the error rate\nobtained over and above the Bayes error rate, is directly proportional to the\nvariance of the actual decision boundaries around the Bayes optimum boundary.\nCombining classifiers in output space reduces this variance, and hence reduces\nthe \"added\" error. If N unbiased classifiers are combined by simple averaging,\nthe added error rate can be reduced by a factor of N if the individual errors\nin approximating the decision boundaries are uncorrelated. Expressions are then\nderived for linear combiners which are biased or correlated, and the effect of\noutput correlations on ensemble performance is quantified. For order statistics\nbased non-linear combiners, we derive expressions that indicate how much the\nmedian, the maximum and in general the ith order statistic can improve\nclassifier performance. The analysis presented here facilitates the\nunderstanding of the relationships among error rates, classifier boundary\ndistributions, and combining in output space. Experimental results on several\npublic domain data sets are provided to illustrate the benefits of combining\nand to support the analytical results.",

The paper\ndefines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representational\npower, and establishes five conditions for the safe use of state abstractions.\nThe paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves\nthat it converges wih probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known\nas a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of\nstate abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and MAXQ-Q\nthrough a series of experiments in three domains and shows experimentally that\nMAXQ-Q (with state abstractions) converges to a recursively optimal policy much\nfaster than flat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ learns a representation of the\nvalue function has an important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and\nexecute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the\npolicy improvement step of policy iteration.

    "summary": "When comparing inductive logic programming (ILP) and attribute-value learning\ntechniques, there is a trade-off between expressive power and efficiency.\nInductive logic programming techniques are typically more expressive but also\nless efficient. Therefore, the data sets handled by current inductive logic\nprogramming systems are small according to general standards within the data\nmining community. The main source of inefficiency lies in the assumption that\nseveral examples may be related to each other, so they cannot be handled\nindependently.\n  Within the learning from interpretations framework for inductive logic\nprogramming this assumption is unnecessary, which allows to scale up existing\nILP algorithms. In this paper we explain this learning setting in the context\nof relational databases. We relate the setting to propositional data mining and\nto the classical ILP setting, and show that learning from interpretations\ncorresponds to learning from multiple relations and thus extends the\nexpressiveness of propositional learning, while maintaining its efficiency to a\nlarge extent (which is not the case in the classical ILP setting).\n  As a case study, we present two alternative implementations of the ILP system\nTilde (Top-down Induction of Logical DEcision trees): Tilde-classic, which\nloads all data in main memory, and Tilde-LDS, which loads the examples one by\none. We experimentally compare the implementations, showing Tilde-LDS can\nhandle large data sets (in the order of 100,000 examples or 100 MB) and indeed\nscales up linearly in the number of examples.",

    "summary": "In order to solve complex configuration tasks in technical domains, various\nknowledge based methods have been developed. However their applicability is\noften unsuccessful due to their low efficiency. One of the reasons for this is\nthat (parts of the) problems have to be solved again and again, instead of\nbeing \"learnt\" from preceding processes. However, learning processes bring with\nthem the problem of conservatism, for in technical domains innovation is a\ndeciding factor in competition. On the other hand a certain amount of\nconservatism is often desired since uncontrolled innovation as a rule is also\ndetrimental. This paper proposes the heuristic RKF (Relevant Knowledge First)\nfor making decisions in configuration processes based on the so-called\nrelevance of objects in a knowledge base. The underlying relevance-function has\ntwo components, one based on reinforcement learning and the other based on\nforgetting (fading). Relevance of an object increases with its successful use\nand decreases with age when it is not used. RKF has been developed to speed up\nthe configuration process and to improve the quality of the solutions relative\nto the reward value that is given by users.",

In cycle $t$ action $y_t$ results in perception $x_t$\nand reward $r_t$, where all quantities in general may depend on the complete\nhistory. The perception $x_t$ and reward $r_t$ are sampled from the (reactive)\nenvironmental probability distribution $\\mu$. This very general setting\nincludes, but is not limited to, (partial observable, k-th order) Markov\ndecision processes. Sequential decision theory tells us how to act in order to\nmaximize the total expected reward, called value, if $\\mu$ is known.\nReinforcement learning is usually used if $\\mu$ is unknown.

    "summary": "Searching the space of policies directly for the optimal policy has been one\npopular method for solving partially observable reinforcement learning\nproblems. Typically, with each change of the target policy, its value is\nestimated from the results of following that very policy. This requires a large\nnumber of interactions with the environment as different polices are\nconsidered. We present a family of algorithms based on likelihood ratio\nestimation that use data gathered when executing one policy (or collection of\npolicies) to estimate the value of a different policy. The algorithms combine\nestimation and optimization stages. The former utilizes experience to build a\nnon-parametric representation of an optimized function. The latter performs\noptimization on this estimate. We show positive empirical results and provide\nthe sample complexity bound.",

    "summary": "This thesis introduces a new unsupervised learning framework, called\nAlignment-Based Learning, which is based on the alignment of sentences and\nHarris's (1951) notion of substitutability. Instances of the framework can be\napplied to an untagged, unstructured corpus of natural language sentences,\nresulting in a labelled, bracketed version of that corpus.\n  Firstly, the framework aligns all sentences in the corpus in pairs, resulting\nin a partition of the sentences consisting of parts of the sentences that are\nequal in both sentences and parts that are unequal. Unequal parts of sentences\ncan be seen as being substitutable for each other, since substituting one\nunequal part for the other results in another valid sentence. The unequal parts\nof the sentences are thus considered to be possible (possibly overlapping)\nconstituents, called hypotheses.\n  Secondly, the selection learning phase considers all hypotheses found by the\nalignment learning phase and selects the best of these. The hypotheses are\nselected based on the order in which they were found, or based on a\nprobabilistic function.\n  The framework can be extended with a grammar extraction phase. This extended\nframework is called parseABL. Instead of returning a structured version of the\nunstructured input corpus, like the ABL system, this system also returns a\nstochastic context-free or tree substitution grammar.\n  Different instances of the framework have been tested on the English ATIS\ncorpus, the Dutch OVIS corpus and the Wall Street Journal corpus. One of the\ninteresting results, apart from the encouraging numerical results, is that all\ninstances can (and do) learn recursive structures.",

    "summary": "Keyphrases are useful for a variety of purposes, including summarizing,\nindexing, labeling, categorizing, clustering, highlighting, browsing, and\nsearching. The task of automatic keyphrase extraction is to select keyphrases\nfrom within the text of a given document. Automatic keyphrase extraction makes\nit feasible to generate keyphrases for the huge number of documents that do not\nhave manually assigned keyphrases. Good performance on this task has been\nobtained by approaching it as a supervised learning problem. An input document\nis treated as a set of candidate phrases that must be classified as either\nkeyphrases or non-keyphrases. To classify a candidate phrase as a keyphrase,\nthe most important features (attributes) appear to be the frequency and\nlocation of the candidate phrase in the document. Recent work has demonstrated\nthat it is also useful to know the frequency of the candidate phrase as a\nmanually assigned keyphrase for other documents in the same domain as the given\ndocument (e.g., the domain of computer science). Unfortunately, this\nkeyphrase-frequency feature is domain-specific (the learning process must be\nrepeated for each new domain) and training-intensive (good performance requires\na relatively large number of training documents in the given domain, with\nmanually assigned keyphrases). The aim of the work described here is to remove\nthese limitations. In this paper, I introduce new features that are derived by\nmining lexical knowledge from a very large collection of unlabeled data,\nconsisting of approximately 350 million Web pages without manually assigned\nkeyphrases. I present experiments that show that the new features result in\nimproved keyphrase extraction, although they are neither domain-specific nor\ntraining-intensive.",

    "title": "How to Shift Bias: Lessons from the Baldwin Effect",
    "summary": "An inductive learning algorithm takes a set of data as input and generates a\nhypothesis as output. A set of data is typically consistent with an infinite\nnumber of hypotheses; therefore, there must be factors other than the data that\ndetermine the output of the learning algorithm. In machine learning, these\nother factors are called the bias of the learner. Classical learning algorithms\nhave a fixed bias, implicit in their design. Recently developed learning\nalgorithms dynamically adjust their bias as they search for a hypothesis.\nAlgorithms that shift bias in this manner are not as well understood as\nclassical algorithms. In this paper, we show that the Baldwin effect has\nimplications for the design and analysis of bias shifting algorithms. The\nBaldwin effect was proposed in 1896, to explain how phenomena that might appear\nto require Lamarckian evolution (inheritance of acquired characteristics) can\narise from purely Darwinian evolution. Hinton and Nowlan presented a\ncomputational model of the Baldwin effect in 1987. We explore a variation on\ntheir model, which we constructed explicitly to illustrate the lessons that the\nBaldwin effect has for research in bias shifting algorithms. The main lesson is\nthat it appears that a good strategy for shift of bias in a learning algorithm\nis to begin with a weak bias and gradually shift to a strong bias.",

I present three novel\nalgorithms for learning various parts of natural languages: first, an algorithm\nfor the induction of syntactic categories from unlabelled text using\ndistributional information, that can deal with ambiguous and rare words;\nsecondly, a set of algorithms for learning morphological processes in a variety\nof languages, including languages such as Arabic with non-concatenative\nmorphology; thirdly an algorithm for the unsupervised induction of a\ncontext-free grammar from tagged text.

The\nclassification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of\nthe phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a\npositive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., \"subtle\nnuances\") and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations\n(e.g., \"very cavalier\"). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is\ncalculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word\n\"excellent\" minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word\n\"poor\". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic\norientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average\naccuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four\ndifferent domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel\ndestinations). The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for\nmovie reviews.",

    "summary": "This position paper argues that the Baldwin effect is widely misunderstood by\nthe evolutionary computation community. The misunderstandings appear to fall\ninto two general categories. Firstly, it is commonly believed that the Baldwin\neffect is concerned with the synergy that results when there is an evolving\npopulation of learning individuals. This is only half of the story. The full\nstory is more complicated and more interesting. The Baldwin effect is concerned\nwith the costs and benefits of lifetime learning by individuals in an evolving\npopulation. Several researchers have focussed exclusively on the benefits, but\nthere is much to be gained from attention to the costs. This paper explains the\ntwo sides of the story and enumerates ten of the costs and benefits of lifetime\nlearning by individuals in an evolving population. Secondly, there is a cluster\nof misunderstandings about the relationship between the Baldwin effect and\nLamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics. The Baldwin effect is not\nLamarckian. A Lamarckian algorithm is not better for most evolutionary\ncomputing problems than a Baldwinian algorithm. Finally, Lamarckian inheritance\nis not a better model of memetic (cultural) evolution than the Baldwin effect.",

    "summary": "We present BL-WoLF, a framework for learnability in repeated zero-sum games\nwhere the cost of learning is measured by the losses the learning agent accrues\n(rather than the number of rounds). The game is adversarially chosen from some\nfamily that the learner knows. The opponent knows the game and the learner's\nlearning strategy. The learner tries to either not accrue losses, or to quickly\nlearn about the game so as to avoid future losses (this is consistent with the\nWin or Learn Fast (WoLF) principle; BL stands for ``bounded loss''). Our\nframework allows for both probabilistic and approximate learning. The resultant\nnotion of {\\em BL-WoLF}-learnability can be applied to any class of games, and\nallows us to measure the inherent disadvantage to a player that does not know\nwhich game in the class it is in. We present {\\em guaranteed\nBL-WoLF-learnability} results for families of games with deterministic payoffs\nand families of games with stochastic payoffs. We demonstrate that these\nfamilies are {\\em guaranteed approximately BL-WoLF-learnable} with lower cost.\nWe then demonstrate families of games (both stochastic and deterministic) that\nare not guaranteed BL-WoLF-learnable. We show that those families,\nnevertheless, are {\\em BL-WoLF-learnable}. To prove these results, we use a key\nlemma which we derive.",

    "summary": "We present an algorithm for learning from unlabeled text, based on the Vector\nSpace Model (VSM) of information retrieval, that can solve verbal analogy\nquestions of the kind found in the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). A verbal\nanalogy has the form A:B::C:D, meaning \"A is to B as C is to D\"; for example,\nmason:stone::carpenter:wood. SAT analogy questions provide a word pair, A:B,\nand the problem is to select the most analogous word pair, C:D, from a set of\nfive choices. The VSM algorithm correctly answers 47% of a collection of 374\ncollege-level analogy questions (random guessing would yield 20% correct). We\nmotivate this research by relating it to work in cognitive science and\nlinguistics, and by applying it to a difficult problem in natural language\nprocessing, determining semantic relations in noun-modifier pairs. The problem\nis to classify a noun-modifier pair, such as \"laser printer\", according to the\nsemantic relation between the noun (printer) and the modifier (laser). We use a\nsupervised nearest-neighbour algorithm that assigns a class to a given\nnoun-modifier pair by finding the most analogous noun-modifier pair in the\ntraining data. With 30 classes of semantic relations, on a collection of 600\nlabeled noun-modifier pairs, the learning algorithm attains an F value of 26.5%\n(random guessing: 3.3%). With 5 classes of semantic relations, the F value is\n43.2% (random: 20%). The performance is state-of-the-art for these challenging\nproblems.",

    "summary": "Keyphrases are useful for a variety of purposes, including summarizing,\nindexing, labeling, categorizing, clustering, highlighting, browsing, and\nsearching. The task of automatic keyphrase extraction is to select keyphrases\nfrom within the text of a given document. Automatic keyphrase extraction makes\nit feasible to generate keyphrases for the huge number of documents that do not\nhave manually assigned keyphrases. A limitation of previous keyphrase\nextraction algorithms is that the selected keyphrases are occasionally\nincoherent. That is, the majority of the output keyphrases may fit together\nwell, but there may be a minority that appear to be outliers, with no clear\nsemantic relation to the majority or to each other. This paper presents\nenhancements to the Kea keyphrase extraction algorithm that are designed to\nincrease the coherence of the extracted keyphrases. The approach is to use the\ndegree of statistical association among candidate keyphrases as evidence that\nthey may be semantically related. The statistical association is measured using\nweb mining. Experiments demonstrate that the enhancements improve the quality\nof the extracted keyphrases. Furthermore, the enhancements are not\ndomain-specific: the algorithm generalizes well when it is trained on one\ndomain (computer science documents) and tested on another (physics documents).",

Semantic orientation varies in both direction (positive or\nnegative) and degree (mild to strong). An automated system for measuring\nsemantic orientation would have application in text classification, text\nfiltering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey\nresponses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). This paper introduces a\nmethod for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical\nassociation with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. Two instances\nof this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of\nword association: pointwise mutual information (PMI) and latent semantic\nanalysis (LSA). The method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including\nadjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive\n(1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words). The method attains an accuracy of\n82.8% on the full test set, but the accuracy rises above 95% when the algorithm\nis allowed to abstain from classifying mild words.",

    "summary": "One of the major successes in computational biology has been the unification,\nusing the graphical model formalism, of a multitude of algorithms for\nannotating and comparing biological sequences. Graphical models that have been\napplied towards these problems include hidden Markov models for annotation,\ntree models for phylogenetics, and pair hidden Markov models for alignment. A\nsingle algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, solves many of the inference\nproblems associated with different statistical models. This paper introduces\nthe \\emph{polytope propagation algorithm} for computing the Newton polytope of\nan observation from a graphical model. This algorithm is a geometric version of\nthe sum-product algorithm and is used to analyze the parametric behavior of\nmaximum a posteriori inference calculations for graphical models.",

    "summary": "This paper describes how fitness inheritance can be used to estimate fitness\nfor a proportion of newly sampled candidate solutions in the Bayesian\noptimization algorithm (BOA). The goal of estimating fitness for some candidate\nsolutions is to reduce the number of fitness evaluations for problems where\nfitness evaluation is expensive. Bayesian networks used in BOA to model\npromising solutions and generate the new ones are extended to allow not only\nfor modeling and sampling candidate solutions, but also for estimating their\nfitness. The results indicate that fitness inheritance is a promising concept\nin BOA, because population-sizing requirements for building appropriate models\nof promising solutions lead to good fitness estimates even if only a small\nproportion of candidate solutions is evaluated using the actual fitness\nfunction. This can lead to a reduction of the number of actual fitness\nevaluations by a factor of 30 or more.",

In order to address\nquestions such as the reliability of the descriptive value, one must consider\nsample-to-population inferential approaches. This paper deals with the\nposterior distribution of mutual information, as obtained in a Bayesian\nframework by a second-order Dirichlet prior distribution. The exact analytical\nexpression for the mean, and analytical approximations for the variance,\nskewness and kurtosis are derived. These approximations have a guaranteed\naccuracy level of the order O(1/n^3), where n is the sample size. Leading order\napproximations for the mean and the variance are derived in the case of\nincomplete samples. The derived analytical expressions allow the distribution\nof mutual information to be approximated reliably and quickly. In fact, the\nderived expressions can be computed with the same order of complexity needed\nfor descriptive mutual information. This makes the distribution of mutual\ninformation become a concrete alternative to descriptive mutual information in\nmany applications which would benefit from moving to the inductive side. Some\nof these prospective applications are discussed, and one of them, namely\nfeature selection, is shown to perform significantly better when inductive\nmutual information is used.",

Learning real-time search agents improve their\nperformance over time by acquiring and refining a value function guiding the\napplication of their actions.

Most\nstudies of learning in real-time search (and reinforcement learning) assume\nthat a simple value-function-greedy policy is used to select actions. This is\nin contrast to practice, where high-performance is usually attained by\ninterleaving planning and acting via a lookahead search of a non-trivial depth.\nIn this paper, we take a step toward bridging this gap and propose a novel\nalgorithm that (i) learns a heuristic function to be used specifically with a\nlookahead-based policy, (ii) selects the lookahead depth adaptively in each\nstate, (iii) gives the user control over the trade-off between exploration and\nexploitation.

    "summary": "While eLearning systems become more and more popular in daily education,\navailable applications lack opportunities to structure, annotate and manage\ntheir contents in a high-level fashion. General efforts to improve these\ndeficits are taken by initiatives to define rich meta data sets and a\nsemanticWeb layer. In the present paper we introduce Hylos, an online learning\nsystem. Hylos is based on a cellular eLearning Object (ELO) information model\nencapsulating meta data conforming to the LOM standard. Content management is\nprovisioned on this semantic meta data level and allows for variable,\ndynamically adaptable access structures. Context aware multifunctional links\npermit a systematic navigation depending on the learners and didactic needs,\nthereby exploring the capabilities of the semantic web. Hylos is built upon the\nmore general Multimedia Information Repository (MIR) and the MIR adaptive\ncontext linking environment (MIRaCLE), its linking extension. MIR is an open\nsystem supporting the standards XML, Corba and JNDI. Hylos benefits from\nmanageable information structures, sophisticated access logic and high-level\nauthoring tools like the ELO editor responsible for the semi-manual creation of\nmeta data and WYSIWYG like content editing.",

Each\nperiod, we must choose a signle point (from some feasible set) and pay a cost\nequal to the value of the next function on our chosen point. Zinkevich shows\nthat, if the each function is revealed after the choice is made, then one can\nachieve vanishingly small regret relative the best single decision chosen in\nhindsight.\n  We extend this to the bandit setting where we do not find out the entire\nfunctions but rather just their value at our chosen point. We show how to get\nvanishingly small regret in this setting.\n  Our approach uses a simple approximation of the gradient that is computed\nfrom evaluating a function at a single (random) point. We show that this\nestimate is sufficient to mimic Zinkevich's gradient descent online analysis,\nwith access to the gradient (only being able to evaluate the function at a\nsingle point).",

    "summary": "This paper introduces Latent Relational Analysis (LRA), a method for\nmeasuring relational similarity. LRA has potential applications in many areas,\nincluding information extraction, word sense disambiguation, machine\ntranslation, and information retrieval. Relational similarity is correspondence\nbetween relations, in contrast with attributional similarity, which is\ncorrespondence between attributes. When two words have a high degree of\nattributional similarity, we call them synonyms. When two pairs of words have a\nhigh degree of relational similarity, we say that their relations are\nanalogous. For example, the word pair mason/stone is analogous to the pair\ncarpenter/wood. Past work on semantic similarity measures has mainly been\nconcerned with attributional similarity. Recently the Vector Space Model (VSM)\nof information retrieval has been adapted to the task of measuring relational\nsimilarity, achieving a score of 47% on a collection of 374 college-level\nmultiple-choice word analogy questions. In the VSM approach, the relation\nbetween a pair of words is characterized by a vector of frequencies of\npredefined patterns in a large corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three\nways: (1) the patterns are derived automatically from the corpus (they are not\npredefined), (2) the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to smooth the\nfrequency data (it is also used this way in Latent Semantic Analysis), and (3)\nautomatically generated synonyms are used to explore reformulations of the word\npairs. LRA achieves 56% on the 374 analogy questions, statistically equivalent\nto the average human score of 57%. On the related problem of classifying\nnoun-modifier relations, LRA achieves similar gains over the VSM, while using a\nsmaller corpus.",

If data are i.i.d. according to\nan (essentially) arbitrary P, then the redundancy grows at rate c/2 ln n. We\nshow that c=v1/v2, where v1 is the variance of P, and v2 is the variance of the\ndistribution m* in M that is closest to P in KL divergence.

The algorithms we consider are for regression, and they involve the\nminimization of regularized risk functionals, such as L(f) := 1/N sum_i\n(f(x_i)-y_i)^2+ lambda ||f||_H^2. We shall call the algorithm `stable' if, when\ny_i is a noisy version of f*(x_i) for some function f* in H, the output of the\nalgorithm converges to f* as the regularization term and noise simultaneously\nvanish. We consider two flavors of this problem, one where a data set of N\npoints remains fixed, and the other where N -> infinity. For the case where N\n-> infinity, we give conditions for convergence to f_E (the function which is\nthe expectation of y(x) for each x), as lambda -> 0. For the fixed N case, we\ndescribe the limiting 'non-noisy', 'non-regularized' function f*, and give\nconditions for convergence. In the process, we develop a set of tools for\ndealing with functionals such as L(f), which are applicable to many other\nproblems in learning theory.",

Moreover, the\nhuman speech code is discrete and compositional, shared by all the individuals\nof a community but different across communities, and phoneme inventories are\ncharacterized by statistical regularities.

In\nsuch applications the uncertainty of classification can be reliably estimated\nwithin a Bayesian model averaging technique that allows the use of prior\ninformation. Decision Tree (DT) classification models used within such a\ntechnique gives experts additional information by making this classification\nscheme observable. The use of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology\nof stochastic sampling makes the Bayesian DT technique feasible to perform.\nHowever, in practice, the MCMC technique may become stuck in a particular DT\nwhich is far away from a region with a maximal posterior. Sampling such DTs\ncauses bias in the posterior estimates, and as a result the evaluation of\nclassification uncertainty may be incorrect. In a particular case, the negative\neffect of such sampling may be reduced by giving additional prior information\non the shape of DTs. In this paper we describe a new approach based on sweeping\nthe DTs without additional priors on the favorite shape of DTs. The\nperformances of Bayesian DT techniques with the standard and sweeping\nstrategies are compared on a synthetic data as well as on real datasets.\nQuantitatively evaluating the uncertainty in terms of entropy of class\nposterior probabilities, we found that the sweeping strategy is superior to the\nstandard strategy.",

For a hidden Markov model with M states, T free transition and E free\nemission parameters, and an input sequence of length L, our new algorithm\nrequires O(M) memory and O(L M T_max (T + E)) time for one Baum-Welch\niteration, where T_max is the maximum number of states that any state is\nconnected to. The most memory efficient algorithm until now was the\ncheckpointing algorithm with O(log(L) M) memory and O(log(L) L M T_max) time\nrequirement. Our novel algorithm thus renders the memory requirement completely\nindependent of the length of the training sequences. More generally, for an\nn-hidden Markov model and n input sequences of length L, the memory requirement\nof O(log(L) L^(n-1) M) is reduced to O(L^(n-1) M) memory while the running time\nis changed from O(log(L) L^n M T_max + L^n (T + E)) to O(L^n M T_max (T + E)).\n  Conclusions: For the large class of hidden Markov models used for example in\ngene prediction, whose number of states does not scale with the length of the\ninput sequence, our novel algorithm can thus be both faster and more\nmemory-efficient than any of the existing algorithms.",

Therefore, in existing\nPLP approaches logic programs with recursive loops are considered to be\nproblematic and thus are excluded. In this paper, we propose an approach that\nmakes use of recursive loops to build a stationary dynamic Bayesian network.\nOur work stems from an observation that recursive loops in a logic program\nimply a time sequence and thus can be used to model a stationary dynamic\nBayesian network without using explicit time parameters.

We then use the well-founded model of a logic\nprogram to define the direct influence relation and apply SLG-resolution to\ncompute the space of random variables together with their parental connections.\nWe introduce a novel notion of influence clauses, based on which a declarative\nsemantics for a Bayesian knowledge base is established and algorithms for\nbuilding a two-slice dynamic Bayesian network from a logic program are\ndeveloped.",

When two pairs have a high degree of\nrelational similarity, they are analogous. For example, the pair cat:meow is\nanalogous to the pair dog:bark. There is evidence from cognitive science that\nrelational similarity is fundamental to many cognitive and linguistic tasks\n(e.g., analogical reasoning). In the Vector Space Model (VSM) approach to\nmeasuring relational similarity, the similarity between two pairs is calculated\nby the cosine of the angle between the vectors that represent the two pairs.\nThe elements in the vectors are based on the frequencies of manually\nconstructed patterns in a large corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three\nways: (1) patterns are derived automatically from the corpus, (2) Singular\nValue Decomposition is used to smooth the frequency data, and (3) synonyms are\nused to reformulate word pairs.

The\nproblem is to classify a noun-modifier pair, such as \"laser printer\", according\nto the semantic relation between the noun (printer) and the modifier (laser).\nWe use a supervised nearest-neighbour algorithm that assigns a class to a given\nnoun-modifier pair by finding the most analogous noun-modifier pair in the\ntraining data. With 30 classes of semantic relations, on a collection of 600\nlabeled noun-modifier pairs, the learning algorithm attains an F value of 26.5%\n(random guessing: 3.3%).

    "summary": "Awerbuch et al.'s approach to distributed recommender systems (DRSs) is to\nhave agents sample products at random while randomly querying one another for\nthe best item they have found; we improve upon this by adding a communication\nnetwork. Agents can only communicate with their immediate neighbors in the\nnetwork, but neighboring agents may or may not represent users with common\ninterests. We define two network structures: in the ``mailing-list model,''\nagents representing similar users form cliques, while in the ``word-of-mouth\nmodel'' the agents are distributed randomly in a scale-free network (SFN). In\nboth models, agents tell their neighbors about satisfactory products as they\nare found. In the word-of-mouth model, knowledge of items propagates only\nthrough interested agents, and the SFN parameters affect the system's\nperformance. We include a summary of our new results on the character and\nparameters of random subgraphs of SFNs, in particular SFNs with power-law\ndegree distributions down to minimum degree 1. These networks are not as\nresilient as Cohen et al. originally suggested. In the case of the widely-cited\n``Internet resilience'' result, high failure rates actually lead to the\norphaning of half of the surviving nodes after 60% of the network has failed\nand the complete disintegration of the network at 90%. We show that given an\nappropriate network, the communication network reduces the number of sampled\nitems, the number of messages sent, and the amount of ``spam.''

Reliable inference about the actual tree is achieved by focusing\non the substructure common to all the plausible trees. We develop an exact\nalgorithm that infers the substructure in time O(m^4), m being the number of\nrandom variables. The new algorithm is applied to a set of data sampled from a\nknown distribution.

    "summary": "The multi-armed bandit is a concise model for the problem of iterated\ndecision-making under uncertainty. In each round, a gambler must pull one of\n$K$ arms of a slot machine, without any foreknowledge of their payouts, except\nthat they are uniformly bounded. A standard objective is to minimize the\ngambler's regret, defined as the gambler's total payout minus the largest\npayout which would have been achieved by any fixed arm, in hindsight. Note that\nthe gambler is only told the payout for the arm actually chosen, not for the\nunchosen arms.\n  Almost all previous work on this problem assumed the payouts to be\nnon-adaptive, in the sense that the distribution of the payout of arm $j$ in\nround $i$ is completely independent of the choices made by the gambler on\nrounds $1, \\dots, i-1$. In the more general model of adaptive payouts, the\npayouts in round $i$ may depend arbitrarily on the history of past choices made\nby the algorithm.\n  We present a new algorithm for this problem, and prove nearly optimal\nguarantees for the regret against both non-adaptive and adaptive adversaries.\nAfter $T$ rounds, our algorithm has regret $O(\\sqrt{T})$ with high probability\n(the tail probability decays exponentially). This dependence on $T$ is best\npossible, and matches that of the full-information version of the problem, in\nwhich the gambler is told the payouts for all $K$ arms after each round.\n  Previously, even for non-adaptive payouts, the best high-probability bounds\nknown were $O(T^{2/3})$, due to Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, Freund and Schapire. The\nexpected regret of their algorithm is $O(T^{1/2}) for non-adaptive payouts, but\nas we show, $\\Omega(T^{2/3})$ for adaptive payouts.",

    "summary": "The adaptation rule for Vector Quantization algorithms, and consequently the\nconvergence of the generated sequence, depends on the existence and properties\nof a function called the energy function, defined on a topological manifold.\nOur aim is to investigate the conditions of existence of such a function for a\nclass of algorithms examplified by the initial ''K-means'' and Kohonen\nalgorithms. The results presented here supplement previous studies and show\nthat the energy function is not always a potential but at least the uniform\nlimit of a series of potential functions which we call a pseudo-potential. Our\nwork also shows that a large number of existing vector quantization algorithms\ndevelopped by the Artificial Neural Networks community fall into this category.\nThe framework we define opens the way to study the convergence of all the\ncorresponding adaptation rules at once, and a theorem gives promising insights\nin that direction. We also demonstrate that the ''K-means'' energy function is\na pseudo-potential but not a potential in general. Consequently, the energy\nfunction associated to the ''Neural-Gas'' is not a potential in general.",

The main problem complicating multicast video transport is\nvariation in network bandwidth constraints. An attractive solution to this\nproblem is to use an adaptive, multi-layered video encoding mechanism. In this\npaper, we consider two such mechanisms for the support of video multicast; one\nis a rate-based mechanism that relies on explicit rate congestion feedback from\nthe network, and the other is a credit-based mechanism that relies on\nhop-by-hop congestion feedback. The responsiveness, bandwidth utilization,\nscalability and fairness of the two mechanisms are evaluated through\nsimulations. Results suggest that while the two mechanisms exhibit performance\ntrade-offs, both are capable of providing a high quality video service in the\npresence of varying bandwidth constraints.",

Web-based CBIR\nimplies the use of heteroge-neous image sets, imposing certain constraints on\nhow the images are organized and the type of performance metrics applicable.\nBIRDS-I only requires controlled human intervention for the compilation of the\nimage collection and none for the generation of ground truth in the measurement\nof retrieval accuracy.

During the typical life\ncycle of multimedia content, events occur at many different levels - from the\nevents which happen during content creation (directing, acting, camera panning\nand zooming) to the events which happen to the physical form (acquisition,\nrelocation, damage of film or video) to the digital conversion, reformatting,\nediting and repackaging events, to the events which are depicted in the actual\ncontent (political, news, sporting) to the usage, ownership and copyright\nagreement events and even the metadata attribution events. Support is required\nwithin both MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 for the clear and unambiguous description of all\nof these event types which may occur at widely different levels of nesting and\ngranularity. In this paper we first describe an event-aware model (the ABC\nmodel) which is capable of modeling and yet clearly differentiating between all\nof these, often recursive and overlapping events. We then illustrate how this\nmodel can be used as the foundation to facilitate semantic interoperability\nbetween MPEG-7 and MPEG-21. By expressing the semantics of both MPEG-7 and\nMPEG-21 metadata terms in RDF Schema (and some DAML+OIL extensions) and\nattaching the MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 class and property hierarchies to the\nappropriate top-level classes and properties of the ABC model, we are\nessentially able to define a single distributed machine-understandable\nontology, which will enable interoperability of data and services across the\nentire multimedia content delivery chain.",

    "title": "Analysis and Visualization of Index Words from Audio Transcripts of\n  Instructional Videos",
    "summary": "We introduce new techniques for extracting, analyzing, and visualizing\ntextual contents from instructional videos of low production quality. Using\nAutomatic Speech Recognition, approximate transcripts (H75% Word Error Rate)\nare obtained from the originally highly compressed videos of university\ncourses, each comprising between 10 to 30 lectures. Text material in the form\nof books or papers that accompany the course are then used to filter meaningful\nphrases from the seemingly incoherent transcripts. The resulting index into the\ntranscripts is tied together and visualized in 3 experimental graphs that help\nin understanding the overall course structure and provide a tool for localizing\ncertain topics for indexing. We specifically discuss a Transcript Index Map,\nwhich graphically lays out key phrases for a course, a Textbook Chapter to\nTranscript Match, and finally a Lecture Transcript Similarity graph, which\nclusters semantically similar lectures. We test our methods and tools on 7 full\ncourses with 230 hours of video and 273 transcripts. We are able to extract up\nto 98 unique key terms for a given transcript and up to 347 unique key terms\nfor an entire course. The accuracy of the Textbook Chapter to Transcript Match\nexceeds 70% on average. The methods used can be applied to genres of video in\nwhich there are recurrent thematic words (news, sports, meetings,...)",

    "summary": "Synergy (from the Greek word synergos), broadly defined, refers to combined\nor co-operative effects produced by two or more elements (parts or\nindividuals). The definition is often associated with the holistic conviction\nquote that \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\" (Aristotle, in\nMetaphysics), or the whole cannot exceed the sum of the energies invested in\neach of its parts (e.g. first law of thermodynamics) even if it is more\naccurate to say that the functional effects produced by wholes are different\nfrom what the parts can produce alone. Synergy is a ubiquitous phenomena in\nnature and human societies alike. One well know example is provided by the\nemergence of self-organization in social insects, via direct or indirect\ninteractions. The latter types are more subtle and defined as stigmergy to\nexplain task coordination and regulation in the context of nest reconstruction\nin termites. An example, could be provided by two individuals, who interact\nindirectly when one of them modifies the environment and the other responds to\nthe new environment at a later time. In other words, stigmergy could be defined\nas a particular case of environmental or spatial synergy. The system is purely\nholistic, and their properties are intrinsically emergent and autocatalytic. On\nthe present work we present a \"machine\" where there is no precommitment to any\nparticular representational scheme: the desired behaviour is distributed and\nroughly specified simultaneously among many parts, but there is minimal\nspecification of the mechanism required to generate that behaviour, i.e. the\nglobal behaviour evolves from the many relations of multiple simple behaviours.",

The\nfirst step is to design the best embedding function for a given detection\nfunction, and the best detection function for a given embedding function.

The accuracy of the similarity measure strongly degrades with the\nlength of the shorter of the two speech segments. These effects of length can\nbe attributed to the measure of covariance used in KL2. We demonstrate an\nempirical correction of this sample-size effect that increases clustering\naccuracy.

Thus in this work, we discuss\nhow to design a better embedder and detector (or decoder). I first give a\nsummary of the prospective applications of watermarking technology and major\nwatermarking schemes in the literature. My review on the literature closely\ncenters upon how the side information is exploited at both embedders and\ndetectors. In Chapter 3, I explore the optimum detector or decoder according to\na particular probability distribution of the host signals. We found that the\nperformance of both multiplicative and additive spread spectrum schemes depends\non the shape parameter of the host signals. For spread spectrum schemes, the\nperformance of the detector or the decoder is reduced by the host interference.\nThus I present a new host-interference rejection technique for the\nmultiplicative spread spectrum schemes. Its embedding rule is tailored to the\noptimum detection or decoding rule. Though the host interference rejection\nschemes enjoy a big performance gain over the traditional spread spectrum\nschemes, their drawbacks that it is difficult for them to be implemented with\nthe perceptual analysis to achieve the maximum allowable embedding level\ndiscourage their use in real scenarios. Thus, in the last chapters of this\nwork, I introduce a double-sided technique to tackle this drawback. It differs\nfrom the host interference rejection schemes in that it utilizes but does not\nreject the host interference at its embedder. The perceptual analysis can be\neasily implemented in our scheme to achieve the maximum allowable level of\nembedding strength.",

    "title": "Robust Audio Watermarking Against the D/A and A/D conversions",
    "summary": "Audio watermarking has played an important role in multimedia security. In\nmany applications using audio watermarking, D/A and A/D conversions (denoted by\nDA/AD in this paper) are often involved. In previous works, however, the\nrobustness issue of audio watermarking against the DA/AD conversions has not\ndrawn sufficient attention yet. In our extensive investigation, it has been\nfound that the degradation of a watermarked audio signal caused by the DA/AD\nconversions manifests itself mainly in terms of wave magnitude distortion and\nlinear temporal scaling, making the watermark extraction failed. Accordingly, a\nDWT-based audio watermarking algorithm robust against the DA/AD conversions is\nproposed in this paper. To resist the magnitude distortion, the relative energy\nrelationships among different groups of the DWT coefficients in the\nlow-frequency sub-band are utilized in watermark embedding by adaptively\ncontrolling the embedding strength. Furthermore, the resynchronization is\ndesigned to cope with the linear temporal scaling. The time-frequency\nlocalization characteristics of DWT are exploited to save the computational\nload in the resynchronization. Consequently, the proposed audio watermarking\nalgorithm is robust against the DA/AD conversions, other common audio\nprocessing manipulations, and the attacks in StirMark Benchmark for Audio,\nwhich has been verified by experiments.",

    "summary": "We first propose a simple mathematical analysis framework for the Enhanced\nDistributed Channel Access (EDCA) function of the recently ratified IEEE\n802.11e standard. Our analysis considers the fact that the distributed random\naccess systems exhibit cyclic behavior. The proposed model is valid for\narbitrary assignments of AC-specific Arbitration Interframe Space (AIFS) values\nand Contention Window (CW) sizes and is the first that considers an arbitrary\ndistribution of active Access Categories (ACs) at the stations. Validating the\ntheoretical results via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed\nanalysis accurately captures the EDCA saturation performance. Next, we propose\na framework for multimedia capacity analysis of the EDCA function. We calculate\nan accurate station- and AC-specific queue utilization ratio by appropriately\nweighing the service time predictions of the cycle time model for different\nnumber of active stations. Based on the calculated queue utilization ratio, we\ndesign a simple model-based admission control scheme. We show that the proposed\ncall admission control algorithm maintains satisfactory user-perceived quality\nfor coexisting voice and video connections in an infrastructure BSS and does\nnot present over- or under-admission problems of previously proposed models in\nthe literature.",

    "summary": "Established in 2005, YouTube has become the most successful Internet site\nproviding a new generation of short video sharing service. Today, YouTube alone\ncomprises approximately 20% of all HTTP traffic, or nearly 10% of all traffic\non the Internet. Understanding the features of YouTube and similar video\nsharing sites is thus crucial to their sustainable development and to network\ntraffic engineering. In this paper, using traces crawled in a 3-month period,\nwe present an in-depth and systematic measurement study on the characteristics\nof YouTube videos. We find that YouTube videos have noticeably different\nstatistics compared to traditional streaming videos, ranging from length and\naccess pattern, to their active life span, ratings, and comments. The series of\ndatasets also allows us to identify the growth trend of this fast evolving\nInternet site in various aspects, which has seldom been explored before. We\nalso look closely at the social networking aspect of YouTube, as this is a key\ndriving force toward its success. In particular, we find that the links to\nrelated videos generated by uploaders' choices form a small-world network. This\nsuggests that the videos have strong correlations with each other, and creates\nopportunities for developing novel caching or peer-to-peer distribution schemes\nto efficiently deliver videos to end users.",

This capacity gain can often be leveraged by\nutilizing channel state information at the transmitter and the receiver. Users\nmake use of this channel state information for transmit signal adaptation. In\nthis correspondence, we derive the capacity region for the MIMO multiple access\nchannel (MIMO MAC) when partial channel state information is available at the\ntransmitters, where we assume a synchronous MIMO multiuser uplink. The partial\nchannel state information feedback has a cardinality constraint and is fed back\nfrom the basestation to the users using a limited rate feedback channel. Using\nthis feedback information, we propose a finite codebook design method to\nmaximize sum-rate. In this correspondence, the codebook is a set of transmit\nsignal covariance matrices. We also derive the capacity region and codebook\ndesign methods in the case that the covariance matrix is rank-one (i.e.,\nbeamforming). This is motivated by the fact that beamforming is optimal in\ncertain conditions. The simulation results show that when the number of\nfeedback bits increases, the capacity also increases. Even with a small number\nof feedback bits, the performance of the proposed system is close to an optimal\nsolution with the full feedback.",

This also applies to\nPeer-to-Peer (P2P) systems and merging these two have already proven to be\nsuccessful (e.g. Skype). Even the existing standards of VoIP provide an\nassurance of security and Quality of Service (QoS), however, these features are\nusually optional and supported by limited number of implementations. As a\nresult, the lack of mandatory and widely applicable QoS and security guaranties\nmakes the contemporary VoIP systems vulnerable to attacks and network\ndisturbances. In this paper we are facing these issues and propose the SecMon\nsystem, which simultaneously provides a lightweight security mechanism and\nimproves quality parameters of the call. SecMon is intended specially for VoIP\nservice over P2P networks and its main advantage is that it provides\nauthentication, data integrity services, adaptive QoS and (D)DoS attack\ndetection. Moreover, the SecMon approach represents a low-bandwidth consumption\nsolution that is transparent to the users and possesses a self-organizing\ncapability. The above-mentioned features are accomplished mainly by utilizing\ntwo information hiding techniques: digital audio watermarking and network\nsteganography.

Some recent\nwatermarking algorithms deal with host interference using side informed\nmethods, but inter-symbols interference problem is still open.

    "summary": "In many emerging applications, data streams are monitored in a network\nenvironment. Due to limited communication bandwidth and other resource\nconstraints, a critical and practical demand is to online compress data streams\ncontinuously with quality guarantee. Although many data compression and digital\nsignal processing methods have been developed to reduce data volume, their\nsuper-linear time and more-than-constant space complexity prevents them from\nbeing applied directly on data streams, particularly over resource-constrained\nsensor networks. In this paper, we tackle the problem of online quality\nguaranteed compression of data streams using fast linear approximation (i.e.,\nusing line segments to approximate a time series). Technically, we address two\nversions of the problem which explore quality guarantees in different forms. We\ndevelop online algorithms with linear time complexity and constant cost in\nspace. Our algorithms are optimal in the sense they generate the minimum number\nof segments that approximate a time series with the required quality guarantee.\nTo meet the resource constraints in sensor networks, we also develop a fast\nalgorithm which creates connecting segments with very simple computation. The\nlow cost nature of our methods leads to a unique edge on the applications of\nmassive and fast streaming environment, low bandwidth networks, and heavily\nconstrained nodes in computational power.

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a general cross-layer optimization framework in\nwhich we explicitly consider both the heterogeneous and dynamically changing\ncharacteristics of delay-sensitive applications and the underlying time-varying\nnetwork conditions. We consider both the independently decodable data units\n(DUs, e.g. packets) and the interdependent DUs whose dependencies are captured\nby a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We first formulate the cross-layer design as\na non-linear constrained optimization problem by assuming complete knowledge of\nthe application characteristics and the underlying network conditions. The\nconstrained cross-layer optimization is decomposed into several cross-layer\noptimization subproblems for each DU and two master problems. The proposed\ndecomposition method determines the necessary message exchanges between layers\nfor achieving the optimal cross-layer solution. However, the attributes (e.g.\ndistortion impact, delay deadline etc) of future DUs as well as the network\nconditions are often unknown in the considered real-time applications. The\nimpact of current cross-layer actions on the future DUs can be characterized by\na state-value function in the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. Based on\nthe dynamic programming solution to the MDP, we develop a low-complexity\ncross-layer optimization algorithm using online learning for each DU\ntransmission. This online algorithm can be implemented in real-time in order to\ncope with unknown source characteristics, network dynamics and resource\nconstraints. Our numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\nonline algorithm.",

To circumvent the complexity emerging when directly dealing with\ndelay, we express performance in term of a convenient metric, called \"stream\ndiffusion metric\". We show that it is directly related to the end-to-end\nminimum delay achievable in a P2P streaming network. In a homogeneous scenario,\nwe derive a performance bound for such metric, and we show how this bound\nrelates to two fundamental parameters: the upload bandwidth available at each\nnode, and the number of neighbors a node may deliver chunks to. In this bound,\nk-step Fibonacci sequences do emerge, and appear to set the fundamental laws\nthat characterize the optimal operation of chunk-based systems.",

These environment dynamics are often ignored in existing\nmulti-user video transmission solutions. To comply with the decentralized\nnature of wireless networks, we propose to decompose the MUMDP into local MDPs\nusing Lagrangian relaxation. Unlike in conventional multi-user video\ntransmission solutions stemming from the network utility maximization\nframework, the proposed decomposition enables each wireless user to\nindividually solve its own dynamic cross-layer optimization (i.e. the local\nMDP) and the network coordinator to update the Lagrangian multipliers (i.e.\nresource prices) based on not only current, but also future resource needs of\nall users, such that the long-term video quality of all users is maximized.\nHowever, solving the MUMDP requires statistical knowledge of the experienced\nenvironment dynamics, which is often unavailable before transmission time. To\novercome this obstacle, we then propose a novel online learning algorithm,\nwhich allows the wireless users to update their policies in multiple states\nduring one time slot. This is different from conventional learning solutions,\nwhich often update one state per time slot. The proposed learning algorithm can\nsignificantly improve the learning performance, thereby dramatically improving\nthe video quality experienced by the wireless users over time. Our simulation\nresults demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MUMDP framework as compared\nto conventional multi-user video transmission solutions.",

    "summary": "We propose a new approach for image compression in digital cameras, where the\ngoal is to achieve better quality at a given rate by using the characteristics\nof a Bayer color filter array. Most digital cameras produce color images by\nusing a single CCD plate, so that each pixel in an image has only one color\ncomponent and therefore an interpolation method is needed to produce a full\ncolor image. After the image processing stage, in order to reduce the memory\nrequirements of the camera, a lossless or lossy compression stage often\nfollows. But in this scheme, before decreasing redundancy through compression,\nredundancy is increased in an interpolation stage. In order to avoid increasing\nthe redundancy before compression, we propose algorithms for image compression\nin which the order of the compression and interpolation stages is reversed. We\nintroduce image transform algorithms, since non interpolated images cannot be\ndirectly compressed with general image coders. The simulation results show that\nour algorithm outperforms conventional methods with various color interpolation\nmethods in a wide range of compression ratios. Our proposed algorithm provides\nnot only better quality but also lower encoding complexity because the amount\nof luminance data used is only half of that in conventional methods.",

In\nparticular, we introduce Greedy Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis (GSLDA)\n\\cite{Moghaddam2007Fast} for its conceptual simplicity and computational\nefficiency; and slightly better detection performance is achieved compared with\n\\cite{Viola2004Robust}. Moreover, we propose a new technique, termed Boosted\nGreedy Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis (BGSLDA), to efficiently train a\ndetection cascade. BGSLDA exploits the sample re-weighting property of boosting\nand the class-separability criterion of GSLDA.",

In this method, in addition to considering the distance\nbetween the interpolated pixel and the neighboring valid pixel, the\ninterpolation coefficients take the local gradient of the original image into\naccount. The smaller the local gradient of a pixel is, the more influence it\nshould have on the interpolated pixel. And the interpolated high resolution\nimage is finally deblurred by the application of wiener filter. Experimental\nresults show that our proposed method not only substantially improves the\nsubjective and objective quality of restored images, especially enhances edges,\nbut also is robust to the registration error and has low computational\ncomplexity.",

    "summary": "Several overlay-based live multimedia streaming platforms have been proposed\nin the recent peer-to-peer streaming literature. In most of the cases, the\noverlay neighbors are chosen randomly for robustness of the overlay. However,\nthis causes nodes that are distant in terms of proximity in the underlying\nphysical network to become neighbors, and thus data travels unnecessary\ndistances before reaching the destination. For efficiency of bulk data\ntransmission like multimedia streaming, the overlay neighborhood should\nresemble the proximity in the underlying network. In this paper, we exploit the\nproximity and redundancy properties of a recently proposed clique-based\nclustered overlay network, named eQuus, to build efficient as well as robust\noverlays for multimedia stream dissemination. To combine the efficiency of\ncontent pushing over tree structured overlays and the robustness of data-driven\nmesh overlays, higher capacity stable nodes are organized in tree structure to\ncarry the long haul traffic and less stable nodes with intermittent presence\nare organized in localized meshes. The overlay construction and fault-recovery\nprocedures are explained in details. Simulation study demonstrates the good\nlocality properties of the platform. The outage time and control overhead\ninduced by the failure recovery mechanism are minimal as demonstrated by the\nanalysis.",

In contrast to building a template from a single\nframe, we train a robust object representation model from a large amount of\ndata. Tracking is viewed as a binary classification problem, and a\ndiscriminative classification rule is learned to distinguish between the object\nand background.

Specifically, we formulate this problem as a finite-horizon\nMarkov decision process (MDP) by explicitly considering the users'\nheterogeneous multimedia traffic characteristics (e.g. delay deadlines,\ndistortion impacts and dependencies etc.), time-varying network conditions as\nwell as, importantly, their ability to adapt their cross-layer transmission\nstrategies in response to these dynamics. Based on the heterogeneous\ncharacteristics of the media packets, we are able to express the transmission\npriorities between packets as a new type of directed acyclic graph (DAG). This\nDAG provides the necessary structure for determining the optimal cross-layer\nactions in each time slot: the root packet in the DAG will always be selected\nfor transmission since it has the highest positive marginal utility; and the\ncomplexity of the proposed cross-layer solution is demonstrated to linearly\nincrease w.r.t. the number of disconnected packet pairs in the DAG and\nexponentially increase w.r.t. the number of packets on which the current\npackets depend on. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nsolution significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art cross-layer\nsolutions. Moreover, we show that our solution provides the upper bound\nperformance for the cross-layer optimization solutions with delayed feedback\nsuch as the well-known RaDiO framework.",

    "title": "Online Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Multimedia Systems",
    "summary": "In our previous work, we proposed a systematic cross-layer framework for\ndynamic multimedia systems, which allows each layer to make autonomous and\nforesighted decisions that maximize the system's long-term performance, while\nmeeting the application's real-time delay constraints. The proposed solution\nsolved the cross-layer optimization offline, under the assumption that the\nmultimedia system's probabilistic dynamics were known a priori. In practice,\nhowever, these dynamics are unknown a priori and therefore must be learned\nonline. In this paper, we address this problem by allowing the multimedia\nsystem layers to learn, through repeated interactions with each other, to\nautonomously optimize the system's long-term performance at run-time. We\npropose two reinforcement learning algorithms for optimizing the system under\ndifferent design constraints: the first algorithm solves the cross-layer\noptimization in a centralized manner, and the second solves it in a\ndecentralized manner. We analyze both algorithms in terms of their required\ncomputation, memory, and inter-layer communication overheads. After noting that\nthe proposed reinforcement learning algorithms learn too slowly, we introduce a\ncomplementary accelerated learning algorithm that exploits partial knowledge\nabout the system's dynamics in order to dramatically improve the system's\nperformance. In our experiments, we demonstrate that decentralized learning can\nperform as well as centralized learning, while enabling the layers to act\nautonomously. Additionally, we show that existing application-independent\nreinforcement learning algorithms, and existing myopic learning algorithms\ndeployed in multimedia systems, perform significantly worse than our proposed\napplication-aware and foresighted learning methods.",

    "summary": "Nowadays, mobile users wish to use their multi-interface mobile devices to\naccess the Internet through network points of attachment (PoA) based on\nheterogeneous wireless technologies. They also wish to seamlessly change the\nPoAs during their ongoing sessions to improve service quality and/or reduce\nmonetary cost. If appropriately handled, multihomed mobile nodes offer a\npotential solution to this issue. In this sense, the management of multihomed\nmobile nodes in heterogeneous environment is a key research topic. In this\npaper, we present an improvement of SIP mobility (pre-call plus mid-call\nmobility) to support seamless mobility of multihomed mobile nodes in\nheterogeneous wireless networks. Pre-call mobility is extended to associate\nuser identifier (i.e. SIP URI) and interface identifiers (i.e. IP addresses).\nThe multiple addresses of a mobile device are weighted by the user to create a\npriority list in the SIP server so as to guarantee resilient reachability of\nmobile nodes and to avoid unnecessary signaling through wireless links, thus\nsaving radio resources. Then, three variations of mid-call mobility, called\nhard, hybrid and soft procedures, are also proposed. Their main aim is to\nminimize, or even avoid, packet losses during interface switching at the mobile\nnode. The proposed solutions have been implemented in a wireless heterogeneous\ntestbed composed of 802.11 WLAN plus 3.5 cellular network, which are fully\ncontrolled and configurable. The testbed has been used to study the performance\nand the robustness of the three proposed mid-call mobility procedures.",

However, the expressing power of these\n\"single-example\" queries fails when the user's delicate query intent is not\navailable as a single example. Recently, the well-known skyline operator was\nreused in metric similarity search as a \"multi-example\" query type. When\napplied on a multi-dimensional database (i.e., on a multi-attribute table), the\ntraditional skyline operator selects all database objects that are not\ndominated by other objects. The metric skyline query adopts the skyline\noperator such that the multiple attributes are represented by distances\n(similarities) to multiple query examples. Hence, we can view the metric\nskyline as a set of representative database objects which are as similar to all\nthe examples as possible and, simultaneously, are semantically distinct. In\nthis paper we propose a technique of processing the metric skyline query by use\nof PM-tree, while we show that our technique significantly outperforms the\noriginal M-tree based implementation in both time and space costs.

Unlike existing\ncongestion control schemes that adapt a user's sending rate merely to the\nnetwork condition, our solution adapts the sending rate to both the network\ncondition and the application characteristics by explicitly considering the\ndistortion impacts, delay deadlines, and interdependencies of different video\npacket classes. Hence, our media-aware solution is able to provide differential\nservices for transmitting various packet classes and thereby, further improves\nthe multimedia streaming quality. We model this problem using a Finite-Horizon\nMarkov Decision Process (FHMDP) and determine the optimal congestion control\npolicy that maximizes the long-term multimedia quality, while adhering to the\nhorizon- TCP-friendliness constraint, which ensures long-term fairness with\nexisting TCP applications. We show that the FHMDP problem can be decomposed\ninto multiple optimal stopping problems, which admit a low-complexity\nthreshold-based solution. Moreover, unlike existing congestion control\napproaches, which focus on maintaining throughput-based fairness among users,\nthe proposed media-TCP aims to achieve quality-based fairness among multimedia\nusers. We also derive sufficient conditions for multiple multimedia users to\nachieve quality-based fairness using media-TCP congestion control. Our\nsimulation results show that the proposed media-TCP achieves more than 3dB\nimprovement in terms of PSNR over the conventional TCP congestion control\napproaches, with the largest improvements observed for real-time streaming\napplications requiring stringent playback delays.",

Several\nresearchers have presented approaches for fingerprint image compression. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel and efficient scheme for fingerprint image\ncompression. The presented scheme utilizes the Bezier curve representations for\neffective compression of fingerprint images. Initially, the ridges present in\nthe fingerprint image are extracted along with their coordinate values using\nthe approach presented. Subsequently, the control points are determined for all\nthe ridges by visualizing each ridge as a Bezier curve. The control points of\nall the ridges determined are stored and are used to represent the fingerprint\nimage. When needed, the fingerprint image is reconstructed from the stored\ncontrol points using Bezier curves. The quality of the reconstructed\nfingerprint is determined by a formal evaluation.

    "summary": "In this paper we have investigated on the reliability of streams for a VoD\nsystem. The objective of the paper is to maximize the availability of streams\nfor the peers in the VoD system. We have achieved this by using data\nreplication technique in the peers. Hence, we proposed a new data replication\ntechnique to optimally store the videos in the peers. The new data replication\ntechnique generates more number of replicas than the existing techniques such\nas random, minimum request and maximize hit. We have also investigated by\napplying the CTMC model for the reliability of replications during the peer\nfailures. Our result shows that the mean lifetime of replicas are more under\nvarious circumstances. We have addressed the practical issues of efficient\nutilization of overall bandwidth and buffer in the VoD system. We achieved\ngreater success playback probability of videos than the existing techniques.",

We develop and evaluate\nan analytical framework for optimal rate allocation based on observed available\nbit rate (ABR) and round-trip time (RTT) over each access network and video\ndistortion-rate (DR) characteristics. The rate allocation is formulated as a\nconvex optimization problem that minimizes the total expected distortion of all\nvideo streams.

The various rate allocation schemes are evaluated in simulations of\nmultiple high-definition (HD) video streams sharing multiple access networks.\nOur results demonstrate that, in comparison with heuristic AIMD-based schemes,\nboth media-aware allocation and H-infinity optimal control benefit from\nproactive congestion avoidance and reduce the average packet loss rate from 45%\nto below 2%. Improvement in average received video quality ranges between 1.5\nto 10.7 dB in PSNR for various background traffic loads and video playout\ndeadlines. Media-aware allocation further exploits its knowledge of the video\nDR characteristics to achieve a more balanced video quality among all streams.",

Network coding allows us to model the receiver's buffer as a queue\nwith Poisson arrivals and deterministic departures. We consider the probability\nof interruption in video playback as well as the number of initially buffered\npackets (initial waiting time) as the QoE metrics. We characterize the optimal\ntrade-off between these metrics by providing upper and lower bounds on the\nminimum initial buffer size, required to achieve certain level of interruption\nprobability for different regimes of the system parameters.

    "summary": "In a video on demand system, the main video repository may be far away from\nthe user and generally has limited streaming capacities. Since a high quality\nvideo's size is huge, it requires high bandwidth for streaming over the\ninternet. In order to achieve a higher video hit ratio, reduced client waiting\ntime, distributed server's architecture can be used, in which multiple local\nservers are placed close to clients and, based on their regional demands video\ncontents are cached dynamically from the main server. As the cost of proxy\nserver is decreasing and demand for reduced waiting time is increasing day by\nday, newer architectures are explored, innovative schemes are arrived at. In\nthis paper we present novel 3 layer architecture, includes main multimedia\nserver, a Tracker and Proxy servers. This architecture targets to optimize the\nclient waiting time. We also propose an efficient prefix caching and load\nsharing algorithm at the proxy server to allocate the cache according to\nregional popularity of the video. The simulation results demonstrate that it\nachieves significantly lower client's waiting time, when compared to the other\nexisting algorithms.",

The non linear sequence alignment known as Dynamic Time\nWarping (DTW) introduced by Sakoe Chiba has been used as features matching\ntechniques. Since it's obvious that the voice signal tends to have different\ntemporal rate, the alignment is important to produce the better\nperformance.This paper present the viability of MFCC to extract features and\nDTW to compare the test patterns.",

    "summary": "Tag recommendation is a common way to enrich the textual annotation of\nmultimedia contents. However, state-of-the-art recommendation methods are built\nupon the pair-wised tag relevance, which hardly capture the context of the web\nvideo, i.e., when who are doing what at where. In this paper we propose the\ncontext-oriented tag recommendation (CtextR) approach, which expands tags for\nweb videos under the context-consistent constraint. Given a web video, CtextR\nfirst collects the multi-form WWW resources describing the same event with the\nvideo, which produce an informative and consistent context; and then, the tag\nrecommendation is conducted based on the obtained context. Experiments on an\n80,031 web video collection show CtextR recommends various relevant tags to web\nvideos. Moreover, the enriched tags improve the performance of web video\ncategorization.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a new compression technique and image watermarking\nalgorithm based on Contourlet Transform (CT). For image compression, an energy\nbased quantization is used. Scalar quantization is explored for image\nwatermarking. Double filter bank structure is used in CT. The Laplacian Pyramid\n(LP) is used to capture the point discontinuities, and then followed by a\nDirectional Filter Bank (DFB) to link point discontinuities. The coefficients\nof down sampled low pass version of LP decomposed image are re-ordered in a\npre-determined manner and prediction algorithm is used to reduce entropy\n(bits/pixel). In addition, the coefficients of CT are quantized based on the\nenergy in the particular band. The superiority of proposed algorithm to JPEG is\nobserved in terms of reduced blocking artifacts. The results are also compared\nwith wavelet transform (WT). Superiority of CT to WT is observed when the image\ncontains more contours. The watermark image is embedded in the low pass image\nof contourlet decomposition. The watermark can be extracted with minimum error.\nIn terms of PSNR, the visual quality of the watermarked image is exceptional.\nThe proposed algorithm is robust to many image attacks and suitable for\ncopyright protection applications.",

The proposed model is composed of a\ndynamic Bayesian network with 4 layers. Our model provides a framework that\nsimulates and combines the visual saliency response and the cognitive state of\na person to estimate the most probable attended regions. Sample-based inference\nwith Markov chain Monte-Carlo based particle filter and stream processing with\nmulti-core processors enable us to estimate human visual attention in near real\ntime. Experimental results have demonstrated that our model performs\nsignificantly better in predicting human visual attention compared to the\nprevious deterministic models.",

This paper builds upon and extends prior work in an area for\nwhich we would like to coin the term \"affective ludology.\" The area is\nconcerned with the affective measurement of player-game interaction. The\nexperimental study reported here investigated different traits of gameplay\nexperience using subjective (i.e., questionnaires) and objective (i.e.,\npsychophysiological) measures. Participants played three Half-Life 2 game level\ndesign modifications while measures such as electromyography (EMG),\nelectrodermal activity (EDA) were taken and questionnaire responses were\ncollected. A level designed for combat-oriented flow experience demonstrated\nsignificant high-arousal positive affect emotions. This method shows that\nemotional patterns emerge from different level designs, which has great\npotential for providing real-time emotional profiles of gameplay that may be\ngenerated together with self- reported subjective player experience\ndescriptions.",

Retrieval of\nimages become difficult when the database is very large. This paper addresses\nsuch problems and presents a novel indexing technique, Feature Based Adaptive\nTolerance Tree (FATT), which is designed to bring an effective solution\nespecially for indexing large databases. The proposed indexing scheme is then\nused along with a query by image content, in order to achieve the ultimate goal\nfrom the user point of view that is retrieval of all relevant images. FATT\nindexing technique, features of the image is extracted using 2-dimensional\ndiscrete wavelet transform (2DDWT) and index code is generated from the\ndeterminant value of the features. Multiresolution analysis technique using\n2D-DWT can decompose the image into components at different scales, so that the\ncoarest scale components carry the global approximation information while the\nfiner scale components contain the detailed information. Experimental results\nshow that the FATT outperforms M-tree upto 200%, Slim-tree up to 120% and HCT\nupto 89%. FATT indexing technique is adopted to increase the efficiently of\ndata storage and retrieval.",

The mounting interest with reference to digital watermarking\nthroughout the last decade is certainly due to the increase in the need of\ncopyright protection of digital content. This is also enhanced due to\ncommercial prospective. Applications of video watermarking in copy control,\nbroadcast monitoring, fingerprinting, video authentication, copyright\nprotection etc is immensely rising. The main aspects of information hiding are\ncapacity, security and robustness. Capacity deals with the amount of\ninformation that can be hidden. The skill of anyone detecting the information\nis security and robustness refers to the resistance to modification of the\ncover content before concealed information is destroyed. Video watermarking\nalgorithms normally prefers robustness. In a robust algorithm it is not\npossible to eliminate the watermark without rigorous degradation of the cover\ncontent. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Video Watermarking and the\nfeatures required to design a robust watermarked video for a valuable\napplication. We review several algorithms, and introduce frequently used key\ntechniques. The aim of this paper is to focus on the various domains of video\nwatermarking techniques.

The\navailability of a system, enhancing human ability to perceive the observed\nscenario, is crucial to improve the performance of a surveillance system. The\ninfrared (IR) camera captures thermal image of object in night-time\nenvironment, when only limited visual information can be captured by RGB\ncamera. The fusion of data recorded by an IR sensor and a visible RGB camera\ncan produce information otherwise not obtainable by viewing the sensor outputs\nseparately. In this paper we consider the problem of fusing two video streams\nacquired by an RGB camera and an IR sensor. The pedestrians, distinctly\ncaptured by IR video, are separated and fused with the RGB video. The\nalgorithms implemented involve estimation of the background, followed by\ndetection of object from the IR Video, after necessary denoising. Finally a\nsuitable fusion algorithm is employed to combine the extracted pedestrians with\nthe visual output. The obtained results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed video fusion scheme, for night vision.",

In this paper we describe the movie data\nstructure and we discuss a proto- type implementation of the camera and\nproviola based on the ProofWeb system. ProofWeb uncouples the interaction with\na PA via a web- interface (the client) from the actual PA that resides on the\nserver. Our camera films a movie by \"listening\" to the ProofWeb communication.\nThe first reason for developing movies is to uncouple the reviewing of a formal\nproof from the PA used to develop it: the movie concept enables users to\ndiscuss small code fragments without the need to install the PA or to load a\nwhole library into it. Other advantages include the possibility to develop a\nseparate com- mentary track to discuss or explain the PA interaction. We assert\nthat a combined camera+proviola provides a generic layer between a client\n(user) and a server (PA). Finally we claim that movies are the right type of\ndata to be stored in an encyclopedia of formalized mathematics, based on our\nexperience in filming the Coq standard library.",

For the\npast 20 years, various formats have been proposed for encoding movement,\nespecially gestures. Though, these formats, at different degrees, were designed\nin the context of quite specific applications (character animation, motion\ncapture, musical gesture, biomechanical concerns...). The article introduce a\nnew file format, called GMS (for 'Gesture and Motion Signal'), with the aim of\nbeing more low-level and generic, by defining the minimal features a format\ncarrying movement/gesture information needs, rather than by gathering all the\ninformation generally given by the existing formats.

The proposed\nformat features the inner properties of such signals: dimensionality,\nstructural features, types of variables, and spatial and temporal properties.\nThe article first reviews the various situations with multisensory virtual\nobjects in which gesture controls intervene. The proposed format is then\ndeduced, as a mean to encode such versatile and variable \"gestural and animated\nscene\".",

The proposed\napproaches allow us to embed adaptive casting degree of watermarks for\ntransparency and robustness to the general image-processing attacks such as\nsmoothing, sharpening, and JPEG compression. The approach has no need the\noriginal host image to extract watermarks. Our schemes have been shown to\nprovide very good results in both image transparency and robustness.",

    "summary": "Automatic video segmentation plays an important role in a wide range of\ncomputer vision and image processing applications. Recently, various methods\nhave been proposed for this purpose. The problem is that most of these methods\nare far from real-time processing even for low-resolution videos due to the\ncomplex procedures. To this end, we propose a new and quite fast method for\nautomatic video segmentation with the help of 1) efficient optimization of\nMarkov random fields with polynomial time of number of pixels by introducing\ngraph cuts, 2) automatic, computationally efficient but stable derivation of\nsegmentation priors using visual saliency and sequential update mechanism, and\n3) an implementation strategy in the principle of stream processing with\ngraphics processor units (GPUs). Test results indicates that our method\nextracts appropriate regions from videos as precisely as and much faster than\nprevious semi-automatic methods even though any supervisions have not been\nincorporated.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel approach for web video categorization by\nleveraging Wikipedia categories (WikiCs) and open resources describing the same\ncontent as the video, i.e., content-duplicated open resources (CDORs). Note\nthat current approaches only col-lect CDORs within one or a few media forms and\nignore CDORs of other forms. We explore all these resources by utilizing WikiCs\nand commercial search engines. Given a web video, its discrimin-ative Wikipedia\nconcepts are first identified and classified. Then a textual query is\nconstructed and from which CDORs are collected. Based on these CDORs, we\npropose to categorize web videos in the space spanned by WikiCs rather than\nthat spanned by raw tags. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nboth the proposed CDOR collection method and the WikiC voting catego-rization\nalgorithm. In addition, the categorization model built based on both WikiCs and\nCDORs achieves better performance compared with the models built based on only\none of them as well as state-of-the-art approach.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a systematic solution to the problem of scheduling\ndelay-sensitive media data for transmission over time-varying wireless\nchannels. We first formulate the dynamic scheduling problem as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) that explicitly considers the users' heterogeneous\nmultimedia data characteristics (e.g. delay deadlines, distortion impacts and\ndependencies etc.) and time-varying channel conditions, which are not\nsimultaneously considered in state-of-the-art packet scheduling algorithms.\nThis formulation allows us to perform foresighted decisions to schedule\nmultiple data units for transmission at each time in order to optimize the\nlong-term utilities of the multimedia applications. The heterogeneity of the\nmedia data enables us to express the transmission priorities between the\ndifferent data units as a priority graph, which is a directed acyclic graph\n(DAG). This priority graph provides us with an elegant structure to decompose\nthe multi-data unit foresighted decision at each time into multiple single-data\nunit foresighted decisions which can be performed sequentially, from the high\npriority data units to the low priority data units, thereby significantly\nreducing the computation complexity. When the statistical knowledge of the\nmultimedia data characteristics and channel conditions is unknown a priori, we\ndevelop a low-complexity online learning algorithm to update the value\nfunctions which capture the impact of the current decision on the future\nutility. The simulation results show that the proposed solution significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art scheduling solutions.",

These resources are often aggravated by many factors like the\ntemporal constraints for availability or node flooding by the requested\nreplicated file chunks. Thus replicated file chunks should be efficiently\ndisseminated in order to enable resource availability on-demand by the mobile\nusers. This work considers a cross layered middleware support system for\nefficient delay-sensitive streaming by using each device's connectivity and\nsocial interactions in a cross layered manner. The collaborative streaming is\nachieved through the epidemically replicated file chunk policy which uses a\ntransition-based approach of a chained model of an infectious disease with\nsusceptible, infected, recovered and death states. The Gossip-based stateful\nmodel enforces the mobile nodes whether to host a file chunk or not or, when no\nlonger a chunk is needed, to purge it. The proposed model is thoroughly\nevaluated through experimental simulation taking measures for the effective\nthroughput Eff as a function of the packet loss parameter in contrast with the\neffectiveness of the replication Gossip-based policy.",

The professed methodology employs a\ncomplete random scheme for pixel selection and embedding of data. Of the three\ncolour channels (Red, Green, Blue) in a given colour image, the least two\nsignificant bits of any one of the channels of the color image is used to\nchannelize the embedding capacity of the remaining two channels. We have\ndevised three approaches to achieve various levels of our desired targets.

In the\nsecond approach, user gets the liberty to select the guiding channel (Red,\nGreen or Blue) to guide the remaining two channels. It will increase the\nrobustness and imperceptibility of the embedded image however the MSE factor\nwill still remain as a drawback. The third approach improves the performance\nfactor as a cyclic methodology is employed and the guiding channel is selected\nin a cyclic fashion.

While\ntraditional Internet-centric approaches such as the MBONE have been used over\nthe past decades, current trends for web-based conference systems make\nexclusive use of application-layer multicast. To allow for network dimensioning\nand QoS provisioning, an understanding of the underlying traffic\ncharacteristics is required. We find in our exemplary evaluations that the host\nof a web conference session produces a large amount of Ethernet traffic,\nlargely due to the required control of the conference session, that is\nheavily-tailed distributed and exhibits additionally long-range dependence. For\ndifferent groups of activities within a web conference session, we find\ndistinctive characteristics of the generated traffic.",

We add a\nredundancy to the original image by mapping the transform coefficients with\nsmall amplitudes to zero and the resultant sparsity pattern is used as the side\ninformation in the recovery stage. If the side information is not available,\nthe receiver has to estimate the sparsity pattern. At the end, the recovery is\ndone by consecutive projecting between two spatial and transform sets.\nExperimental results show that our method works well for both structural and\ntexture images and outperforms other techniques in objective and subjective\nperformance measures.",

The other area in the Image mining system is the\nContent-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) which performs retrieval based on the\nsimilarity defined in terms of extracted features with more objectiveness. The\ndrawback in CBIR is the features of the query image alone are considered.\nHence, a new technique called Image retrieval based on optimum clusters is\nproposed for improving user interaction with image retrieval systems by fully\nexploiting the similarity information.

    "summary": "As a powerful statistical image modeling technique, sparse representation has\nbeen successfully used in various image restoration applications. The success\nof sparse representation owes to the development of l1-norm optimization\ntechniques, and the fact that natural images are intrinsically sparse in some\ndomain. The image restoration quality largely depends on whether the employed\nsparse domain can represent well the underlying image. Considering that the\ncontents can vary significantly across different images or different patches in\na single image, we propose to learn various sets of bases from a pre-collected\ndataset of example image patches, and then for a given patch to be processed,\none set of bases are adaptively selected to characterize the local sparse\ndomain. We further introduce two adaptive regularization terms into the sparse\nrepresentation framework. First, a set of autoregressive (AR) models are\nlearned from the dataset of example image patches. The best fitted AR models to\na given patch are adaptively selected to regularize the image local structures.\nSecond, the image non-local self-similarity is introduced as another\nregularization term. In addition, the sparsity regularization parameter is\nadaptively estimated for better image restoration performance. Extensive\nexperiments on image deblurring and super-resolution validate that by using\nadaptive sparse domain selection and adaptive regularization, the proposed\nmethod achieves much better results than many state-of-the-art algorithms in\nterms of both PSNR and visual perception.",

    "summary": "In the last few years, the Internet throughput, usage and reliability have\nincreased almost exponentially. The introduction of broadband wireless mobile\nad hoc networks (MANETs) and cellular networks together with increased\ncomputational power have opened the door for a new breed of applications to be\ncreated, namely real-time multimedia applications. Delivering real-time\nmultimedia traffic over a complex network like the Internet is a particularly\nchallenging task since these applications have strict quality -of-service (QoS)\nrequirements on bandwidth, delay, and delay jitter. Traditional IP-based best\neffort service will not be able to meet these stringent requirements. The\ntime-varying nature of wireless channels and resource constrained wireless\ndevices make the problem even more difficult. To improve perceived media\nquality by end users over wireless Internet, QoS supports can be addressed in\ndifferent layers, including application layer, transport layer and link layer.\nCross layer design is a well-known approach to achieve this adaptation. In\ncross-layer design, the challenges from the physical wireless medium and the\nQoS-demands from the applications are taken into account so that the rate,\npower, and coding at the physical layer can adapted to meet the requirements of\nthe applications given the current channel and network conditions. A number of\npropositions for cross-layer designs exist in the literature. In this paper, an\nextensive review has been made on these cross-layer architectures that combine\nthe application-layer, transport layer and the link layer controls.\nParticularly the issues like channel estimation techniques, adaptive controls\nat the application and link layers for energy efficiency, priority based\nscheduling, transmission rate control at the transport layer, and adaptive\nautomatic repeat request (ARQ) are discussed in detail.",

However, with Hilbert transforms, the\ntransformed space is of order $2m$ by $2n$. This allows for more latitude in\nstoring the watermark in the host image. Based on this idea, we propose an\nalgorithm for embedding and extracting watermark in a host image and\nanalytically obtain a parameter related to this procedure. Using extensive\nsimulations, we show that the algorithm performs well even if the host image is\ncorrupted by various attacks.",

    "summary": "The problem of packet scheduling for traffic streams with target outflow\nprofiles traversing input queued switches is formulated in this paper. Target\noutflow profiles specify the desirable inter-departure times of packets leaving\nthe switch from each traffic stream. The goal of the switch scheduler is to\ndynamically select service configurations of the switch, so that actual outflow\nstreams (\"pulled\" through the switch) adhere to their desired target profiles\nas accurately as possible. Dynamic service controls (schedules) are developed\nto minimize deviation of actual outflow streams from their targets and suppress\nstream \"distortion\". Using appropriately selected subsets of service\nconfigurations of the switch, efficient schedules are designed, which deliver\nhigh performance at relatively low complexity. Some of these schedules are\nprovably shown to achieve 100% pull-throughput. Moreover, simulations\ndemonstrate that for even substantial contention of streams through the switch,\ndue to stringent/intense target outflow profiles, the proposed schedules\nachieve closely their target profiles and suppress stream distortion. The\nswitch model investigated here deviates from the classical switching paradigm.\nIn the latter, the goal of packet scheduling is primarily to \"push\" as much\ntraffic load through the switch as possible, while controlling delay to\ntraverse the switch and keeping congestion/backlogs from exploding. In the\nmodel presented here, however, the goal of packet scheduling is to \"pull\"\ntraffic streams through the switch, maintaining desirable (target) outflow\nprofiles.",

Most of\ncurrent CS recovery algorithms are originally designed for one-dimensional (1D)\nsignal, while many practical signals are two-dimensional (2D). By utilizing 2D\nseparable sampling, 2D signal recovery problem can be converted into 1D signal\nrecovery problem so that ordinary 1D recovery algorithms, e.g. orthogonal\nmatching pursuit (OMP), can be applied directly. However, even with 2D\nseparable sampling, the memory usage and complexity at the decoder is still\nhigh. This paper develops a novel recovery algorithm called 2D-OMP, which is an\nextension of 1D-OMP. In the 2D-OMP, each atom in the dictionary is a matrix. At\neach iteration, the decoder projects the sample matrix onto 2D atoms to select\nthe best matched atom, and then renews the weights for all the already selected\natoms via the least squares. We show that 2D-OMP is in fact equivalent to\n1D-OMP, but it reduces recovery complexity and memory usage significantly.\nWhat's more important, by utilizing the same methodology used in this paper,\none can even obtain higher dimensional OMP (say 3D-OMP, etc.) with ease.",

Most solutions for\nproviding incentives in P2P networks are based on direct reciprocity, which are\nnot appropriate for most P2P multimedia sharing networks due to the unique\nfeatures exhibited by such networks: large populations of anonymous agents\ninteracting infrequently, asymmetric interests of peers, network errors, and\nmultiple concurrent transactions. In this paper, we design and rigorously\nanalyze a new family of incentive protocols that utilizes indirect reciprocity\nwhich is based on the design of efficient social norms. In the proposed P2P\nprotocols, the social norms consist of a social strategy, which represents the\nrule prescribing to the peers when they should or should not provide content to\nother peers, and a reputation scheme, which rewards or punishes peers depending\non whether they comply or not with the social strategy. We first define the\nconcept of a sustainable social norm, under which no peer has an incentive to\ndeviate. We then formulate the problem of designing optimal social norms, which\nselects the social norm that maximizes the network performance among all\nsustainable social norms. Hence, we prove that it becomes in the self-interest\nof peers to contribute their content to the network rather than to free-ride.\nWe also investigate the impact of various punishment schemes on the social\nwelfare as well as how should the optimal social norms be designed if\naltruistic and malicious peers are active in the network. Our results show that\noptimal social norms are capable of providing significant improvements in the\nsharing efficiency of multimedia P2P networks.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses rate control for transmission of scalable video streams\nvia Network Utility Maximization (NUM) formulation. Due to stringent QoS\nrequirements of video streams and specific characterization of utility\nexperienced by end-users, one has to solve nonconvex and even nonsmooth NUM\nformulation for such streams, where dual methods often prove incompetent.\nConvexification plays an important role in this work as it permits the use of\nexisting dual methods to solve an approximate to the NUM problem iteratively\nand distributively. Hence, to tackle the nonsmoothness and nonconvexity, we aim\nat reformulating the NUM problem through approximation and transformation of\nthe ideal discretely adaptive utility function for scalable video streams. The\nreformulated problem is shown to be a D.C. (Difference of Convex) problem. We\nleveraged Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach to replace the nonconvex\nD.C. problem by a sequence of convex problems that aim to approximate the\noriginal D.C. problem. We then solve each convex problem produced by SCP\napproach using existing dual methods. This procedure is the essence of two\ndistributed iterative rate control algorithms proposed in this paper, for which\none can show the convergence to a locally optimal point of the nonconvex D.C.\nproblem and equivalently to a locally optimal point of an approximate to the\noriginal nonconvex problem. Our experimental results show that the proposed\nrate control algorithms converge with tractable convergence behavior.",

    "summary": "We investigate the impact of cooperative relaying on uplink and downlink\nmulti-user (MU) wireless video transmissions. The objective is to maximize the\nlong-term sum of utilities across the video terminals in a decentralized\nfashion, by jointly optimizing the packet scheduling, the resource allocation,\nand the cooperation decisions, under the assumption that some nodes are willing\nto act as cooperative relays. A pricing-based distributed resource allocation\nframework is adopted, where the price reflects the expected future congestion\nin the network. Specifically, we formulate the wireless video transmission\nproblem as an MU Markov decision process (MDP) that explicitly considers the\ncooperation at the physical layer and the medium access control sublayer, the\nvideo users' heterogeneous traffic characteristics, the dynamically varying\nnetwork conditions, and the coupling among the users' transmission strategies\nacross time due to the shared wireless resource. Although MDPs notoriously\nsuffer from the curse of dimensionality, our study shows that, with appropriate\nsimplications and approximations, the complexity of the MU-MDP can be\nsignificantly mitigated. Our simulation results demonstrate that integrating\ncooperative decisions into the MU-MDP optimization can increase the resource\nprice in networks that only support low transmission rates and can decrease the\nprice in networks that support high transmission rates. Additionally, our\nresults show that cooperation allows users with feeble direct signals to\nachieve improvements in video quality on the order of 5-10 dB peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), with less than 0.8 dB quality loss by users with\nstrong direct signals, and with a moderate increase in total network energy\nconsumption that is significantly less than the energy that a distant node\nwould require to achieve an equivalent PSNR without exploiting cooperative\ndiversity.",

We propose a novel dimension reduction tool, termed sparse\ntransfer learning (STL), to effectively and efficiently encode user's labeling\ninformation. STL is particularly designed for interactive video search\nreranking. Technically, it a) considers the pair-wise discriminative\ninformation to maximally separate labeled query relevant samples from labeled\nquery irrelevant ones, b) achieves a sparse representation for the subspace to\nencodes user's intention by applying the elastic net penalty, and c) propagates\nuser's labeling information from labeled samples to unlabeled samples by using\nthe data distribution knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on the\nTRECVID 2005, 2006 and 2007 benchmark datasets and compared STL with popular\ndimension reduction algorithms. We report superior performance by using the\nproposed STL based interactive video search reranking.",

    "summary": "Recently, the market size of online game has been increasing astonishingly\nfast, and so does the importance of good game design. In online games, usually\na human user competes with others, so the fairness of the game system to all\nusers is of great importance not to lose interests of users on the game.\nFurthermore, the emergence and success of electronic sports (e-sports) and\nprofessional gaming which specially talented gamers compete with others draws\nmore attention on whether they are competing in the fair environment. No matter\nhow fierce the debates are in the game-design community, it is rarely the case\nthat one employs statistical analysis to answer this question seriously. But\nconsidering the fact that we can easily gather large amount of user behavior\ndata on games, it seems potentially beneficial to make use of this data to aid\nmaking decisions on design problems of games. Actually, modern games do not aim\nto perfectly design the game at once: rather, they first release the game, and\nthen monitor users' behavior to better balance the game. In such a scenario,\nstatistical analysis can be particularly helpful. Specifically, we chose to\nanalyze the balance of StarCraft II, which is a very successful\nrecently-released real-time strategy (RTS) game. It is a central icon in\ncurrent e-Sports and professional gaming community: from April 1st to 15th,\nthere were 18 tournaments of StarCraft II. However, there is endless debate on\nwhether the winner of the tournament is actually superior to others, or it is\nlargely due to certain design flaws of the game. In this paper, we aim to\nanswer such a question using traditional statistical tool, logistic regression.",

Conventional schemes rely on digitizing images through\nquantization (which inevitably causes significant bandwidth expansion) and\ntransmitting binary bit-streams through digital error correction codes (which\ndo not automatically differentiate the different levels of significance among\nthe bits). To strike a better overall performance in terms of transmission\nefficiency and quality, we propose to use a single analog error correction code\nin lieu of digital quantization, digital code and digital modulation. The key\nis to get analog coding right. We show that this can be achieved by cleverly\nexploiting an elegant \"butterfly\" property of chaotic systems. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate a tail-biting triple-branch baker's map code and its\nmaximum-likelihood decoding algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed\nanalog code can actually outperform digital turbo code, one of the best codes\nknown to date. The results and findings discussed in this paper speak volume\nfor the promising potential of analog codes, in spite of their rather short\nhistory.",

    "summary": "Many tasks in music information retrieval, such as recommendation, and\nplaylist generation for online radio, fall naturally into the query-by-example\nsetting, wherein a user queries the system by providing a song, and the system\nresponds with a list of relevant or similar song recommendations. Such\napplications ultimately depend on the notion of similarity between items to\nproduce high-quality results. Current state-of-the-art systems employ\ncollaborative filter methods to represent musical items, effectively comparing\nitems in terms of their constituent users. While collaborative filter\ntechniques perform well when historical data is available for each item, their\nreliance on historical data impedes performance on novel or unpopular items. To\ncombat this problem, practitioners rely on content-based similarity, which\nnaturally extends to novel items, but is typically out-performed by\ncollaborative filter methods.\n  In this article, we propose a method for optimizing contentbased similarity\nby learning from a sample of collaborative filter data. The optimized\ncontent-based similarity metric can then be applied to answer queries on novel\nand unpopular items, while still maintaining high recommendation accuracy. The\nproposed system yields accurate and efficient representations of audio content,\nand experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy over\ncompeting content-based recommendation techniques.",

In addition to providing simple graphical\nobjects such as windows, geometric shapes, and bitmaps, EzWindows provides\nfacilities for introducing event-based programming using the mouse and timers.\nEzWindows has proven to be extremely popular; it is currently in use at over\n200 universities, colleges, and high schools. This paper describes the\nrationale for EzWindows and its high-level design.",

    "summary": "The compression of geometric structures is a relatively new field of data\ncompression. Since about 1995, several articles have dealt with the coding of\nmeshes, using for most of them the following approach: the vertices of the mesh\nare coded in an order such that it contains partially the topology of the mesh.\nIn the same time, some simple rules attempt to predict the position of the\ncurrent vertex from the positions of its neighbours that have been previously\ncoded. In this article, we describe a compression algorithm whose principle is\ncompletely different: the order of the vertices is used to compress their\ncoordinates, and then the topology of the mesh is reconstructed from the\nvertices. This algorithm, particularly suited for terrain models, achieves\ncompression factors that are slightly greater than those of the currently\navailable algorithms, and moreover, it allows progressive and interactive\ntransmission of the meshes.",

Our algorithm constructs the sampled visibility map of the\ntriangles with respect to the pixels, which is the subset of the trapezoids in\na trapezoidal decomposition of the analytic visibility map that contain at\nleast one pixel. The sampled visibility map adapts to local changes in image\ncomplexity, and its complexity is bounded both by the number of pixels and by\nthe complexity of the analytic visibility map. Our algorithm runs in time\nO(n^{1+e} + n^{2/3+e}t^{2/3} + p), where t is the output size and e is any\npositive constant. This is nearly optimal in the worst case and compares\nfavorably with the best output-sensitive algorithms for both ray casting and\nanalytic hidden surface removal. In the special case where the pixels form a\nregular grid, a sweepline variant of our algorithm runs in time O(n^{1+e} +\nn^{2/3+e}t^{2/3} + t log p), which is usually sublinear in the number of\npixels.",

Several compression methods are\navailable to address these limits for objects represented by triangle meshes.\nMany CAD and VRML models, however, are represented as quadrilateral meshes or\nmixed triangle/quadrilateral meshes, and these models may also require\ncompression. We present an algorithm for encoding the connectivity of such\nquadrilateral meshes, and we demonstrate that by preserving and exploiting the\noriginal quad structure, our approach achieves encodings 30 - 80% smaller than\nan approach based on randomly splitting quads into triangles.

    "summary": "We propose a fast methodology for encoding graphs with\ninformation-theoretically minimum numbers of bits. Specifically, a graph with\nproperty pi is called a pi-graph. If pi satisfies certain properties, then an\nn-node m-edge pi-graph G can be encoded by a binary string X such that (1) G\nand X can be obtained from each other in O(n log n) time, and (2) X has at most\nbeta(n)+o(beta(n)) bits for any continuous super-additive function beta(n) so\nthat there are at most 2^{beta(n)+o(beta(n))} distinct n-node pi-graphs. The\nmethodology is applicable to general classes of graphs; this paper focuses on\nplanar graphs. Examples of such pi include all conjunctions over the following\ngroups of properties: (1) G is a planar graph or a plane graph; (2) G is\ndirected or undirected; (3) G is triangulated, triconnected, biconnected,\nmerely connected, or not required to be connected; (4) the nodes of G are\nlabeled with labels from {1, ..., ell_1} for ell_1 <= n; (5) the edges of G are\nlabeled with labels from {1, ..., ell_2} for ell_2 <= m; and (6) each node\n(respectively, edge) of G has at most ell_3 = O(1) self-loops (respectively,\nell_4 = O(1) multiple edges). Moreover, ell_3 and ell_4 are not required to be\nO(1) for the cases of pi being a plane triangulation. These examples are novel\napplications of small cycle separators of planar graphs and are the only\nnontrivial classes of graphs, other than rooted trees, with known\npolynomial-time information-theoretically optimal coding schemes.",

It was developed for high energy physics event display applications\nand is especially suited to client/server or component frameworks. The GLAST\nexperiment, an international effort led by NASA for a gamma-ray telescope to\nlaunch in 2006, chose HepRep to provide a flexible, extensible and maintainable\nframework for their event display without tying their users to any one graphics\napplication. To support HepRep in their GUADI infrastructure, GLAST developed a\nHepRep filler and builder architecture. The architecture hides the details of\nXML and CORBA in a set of base and helper classes allowing physics experts to\nfocus on what data they want to represent. GLAST has two GAUDI services:\nHepRepSvc, which registers HepRep fillers in a global registry and allows the\nHepRep to be exported to XML, and CorbaSvc, which allows the HepRep to be\npublished through a CORBA interface and which allows the client application to\nfeed commands back to GAUDI (such as start next event, or run some GAUDI\nalgorithm). GLAST's HepRep solution gives users a choice of client\napplications, WIRED (written in Java) or FRED (written in C++ and Ruby), and\nleaves them free to move to any future HepRep-compliant event display.",

The most prominent example is that of the computations\nperformed by a graphics card. The operations themselves are very simple, and\nrequire very little memory, but require the ability to perform many\ncomputations extremely fast and in parallel to whatever degree possible. What\nhas resulted is a stream processor that is highly optimized for stream\ncomputations. An intriguing side effect of this is the growing use of a\ngraphics card as a general purpose stream processing engine. In an\never-increasing array of applications, researchers are discovering that\nperforming a computation on a graphics card is far faster than performing it on\na CPU, and so are using a GPU as a stream co-processor.",

It is\nNP-complete to test whether a given triangulated model can be represented as a\nsingle triangle strip, so many heuristics have been proposed to partition\nmodels into few long strips. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for\ncreating a single triangle loop or strip from a triangulated model. Our method\napplies a dual graph matching algorithm to partition the mesh into cycles, and\nthen merges pairs of cycles by splitting adjacent triangles when necessary. New\nvertices are introduced at midpoints of edges and the new triangles thus formed\nare coplanar with their parent triangles, hence the visual fidelity of the\ngeometry is not changed. We prove that the increase in the number of triangles\ndue to this splitting is 50% in the worst case, however for all models we\ntested the increase was less than 2%. We also prove tight bounds on the number\nof triangles needed for a single-strip representation of a model with holes on\nits boundary. Our strips can be used not only for efficient rendering, but also\nfor other applications including the generation of space filling curves on a\nmanifold of any arbitrary topology.",

    "summary": "Von Neuman's work on universal machines and the hardware development have\nallowed the simulation of dynamical systems through a large set of interacting\nagents. This is a bottom-up approach which tries to derive global properties of\na complex system through local interaction rules and agent behaviour.\nTraditionally, such systems are modeled and simulated through top-down methods\nbased on differential equations. Agent-Based Modeling has the advantage of\nsimplicity and low computational cost. However, unlike differential equations,\nthere is no standard way to express agent behaviour. Besides, it is not clear\nhow to analytically predict the results obtained by the simulation. In this\npaper we survey some of these methods. For expressing agent behaviour formal\nmethods, like Stochastic Process Algebras have been used. Such approach is\nuseful if the global properties of interest can be expressed as a function of\nstochastic time series. However, if space variables must be considered, we\nshall change the focus. In this case, multiscale techniques, based on\nChapman-Enskog expansion, was used to establish the connection between the\nmicroscopic dynamics and the macroscopic observables. Also, we use data mining\ntechniques,like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to study agent systems like\nCellular Automata. With the help of these tools we will discuss a simple\nsociety model, a Lattice Gas Automaton for fluid modeling, and knowledge\ndiscovery in CA databases. Besides, we show the capabilities of the NetLogo, a\nsoftware for agent simulation of complex system and show our experience about.",

However, to our knowledge the actual usefulness of space time\ncube representation in conveying complex spatiotemporal patterns to users has\nnot been empirically validated. To fill this gap we report on a\nbetween-subjects experiment comparing novice users error rates and response\ntimes when answering a set of questions using either space time cube or a\nbaseline 2D representation. For some simple questions the error rates were\nlower when using the baseline representation. For complex questions where the\nparticipants needed an overall understanding of the spatiotemporal structure of\nthe dataset, the space time cube representation resulted in on average twice as\nfast response times with no difference in error rates compared to the baseline.\nThese results provide an empirical foundation for the hypothesis that space\ntime cube representation benefits users when analyzing complex spatiotemporal\npatterns.",

    "summary": "I postulate that human or other intelligent agents function or should\nfunction as follows. They store all sensory observations as they come - the\ndata is holy. At any time, given some agent's current coding capabilities, part\nof the data is compressible by a short and hopefully fast program / description\n/ explanation / world model. In the agent's subjective eyes, such data is more\nregular and more \"beautiful\" than other data. It is well-known that knowledge\nof regularity and repeatability may improve the agent's ability to plan actions\nleading to external rewards. In absence of such rewards, however, known beauty\nis boring. Then \"interestingness\" becomes the first derivative of subjective\nbeauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly\napparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful.\nSuch progress in compressibility is measured and maximized by the curiosity\ndrive: create action sequences that extend the observation history and yield\npreviously unknown / unpredictable but quickly learnable algorithmic\nregularity. We discuss how all of the above can be naturally implemented on\ncomputers, through an extension of passive unsupervised learning to the case of\nactive data selection: we reward a general reinforcement learner (with access\nto the adaptive compressor) for actions that improve the subjective\ncompressibility of the growing data. An unusually large breakthrough in\ncompressibility deserves the name \"discovery\". The \"creativity\" of artists,\ndancers, musicians, pure mathematicians can be viewed as a by-product of this\nprinciple. Several qualitative examples support this hypothesis.",

    "summary": "A new computer haptics algorithm to be used in general interactive\nmanipulations of deformable virtual objects is presented. In multimodal\ninteractive simulations, haptic feedback computation often comes from contact\nforces. Subsequently, the fidelity of haptic rendering depends significantly on\ncontact space modeling. Contact and friction laws between deformable models are\noften simplified in up to date methods. They do not allow a \"realistic\"\nrendering of the subtleties of contact space physical phenomena (such as slip\nand stick effects due to friction or mechanical coupling between contacts). In\nthis paper, we use Signorini's contact law and Coulomb's friction law as a\ncomputer haptics basis. Real-time performance is made possible thanks to a\nlinearization of the behavior in the contact space, formulated as the so-called\nDelassus operator, and iteratively solved by a Gauss-Seidel type algorithm.\nDynamic deformation uses corotational global formulation to obtain the Delassus\noperator in which the mass and stiffness ratio are dissociated from the\nsimulation time step. This last point is crucial to keep stable haptic\nfeedback. This global approach has been packaged, implemented, and tested.\nStable and realistic 6D haptic feedback is demonstrated through a clipping task\nexperiment.",

    "summary": "The concept of metaphor, in particular graphical (or visual) metaphor, is\ncentral to the field of information visualization. Information graphics and\ninteractive information visualization systems employ a variety of metaphorical\ndevices to make abstract, complex, voluminous, or otherwise\ndifficult-to-comprehend information understandable in graphical terms. This\npaper explores the use of metaphor in information visualization, advancing the\ntheory previously argued by Johnson, Lakoff, Tversky et al. that many\ninformation graphics are metaphorically understood in terms of cognitively\nentrenched spatial patterns known as image schemas. These patterns serve to\nstructure and constrain abstract reasoning processes via metaphorical\nprojection operations that are grounded in everyday perceptual experiences with\nphenomena such as containment, movement, and force dynamics. Building on\nprevious research, I argue that information graphics promote comprehension of\ntheir target information through the use of graphical patterns that invoke\nthese preexisting schematic structures. I further theorize that the degree of\nstructural alignment of a particular graphic with one or more corresponding\nimage schemas accounts for its perceived degree of intuitiveness. Accordingly,\nimage schema theory can provide a powerful explanatory and predictive framework\nfor visualization research. I review relevant theories of analogy and metaphor,\nand discuss the image schematic properties of several common types of\ninformation graphic. I conclude with the proposal that the inventory of image\nschemas culled from linguistic studies can serve as the basis for an inventory\nof design elements suitable for developing intuitive and effective new\ninformation visualization techniques.",

The objectives of adopting this concept are to address the several\nmajor difficulties in the application of Active Contours. Primarily, a\ntechnique is developed to realize the topological changes of Parametric Active\nContours (Snakes). The key strategy is to imitate the process of a balloon\nexpanding and filling in a closed space with several objects. After removing\nthe touched balloon surfaces, the objects can be identified by surrounded\nremaining balloon surfaces. A burned region swept by Snakes is utilized to\ntrace the contour and to give a criterion for stopping the movement of Snake\ncurve. When the Snakes terminates evolution totally, through ignoring this\ncriterion, it can form a connected area by evolving the Snakes again and\ncontinuing the region burning. The contours extracted from the boundaries of\nthe burned area can represent the child snake of each object respectively.\nSecondly, a novel scheme is designed to solve the problems of leakage of the\ncontour from the large gaps, and the segmentation error in Geometric Active\nContours (GAC). It divides the segmentation procedure into two processing\nstages. By simulating the wave propagating in the isotropic substance at the\nfinal stage, it can significantly enhance the effect of image force in GAC\nbased on Level Set and give the satisfied solutions to the two problems.\nThirdly, to support the physical models for active contours above, we introduce\na general image force field created on a template plane over the image plane.\nThis force is more adaptable to noisy images with complicated geometric shapes.",

The two black holes are evolved using post-Newtonian\napproximations starting with initially randomly distributed spin vectors.

    "summary": "Researchers got success in mining the Web usage data effectively and\nefficiently. But representation of the mined patterns is often not in a form\nsuitable for direct human consumption. Hence mechanisms and tools that can\nrepresent mined patterns in easily understandable format are utilized.\nDifferent techniques are used for pattern analysis, one of them is\nvisualization. Visualization can provide valuable assistance for data analysis\nand decision making tasks. In the data visualization process, technical\nrepresentations of web pages are replaced by user attractive text\ninterpretations. Experiments with the real world problems showed that the\nvisualization can significantly increase the quality and usefulness of web log\nmining results. However, how decision makers perceive and interact with a\nvisual representation can strongly influence their understanding of the data as\nwell as the usefulness of the visual presentation. Human factors therefore\ncontribute significantly to the visualization process and should play an\nimportant role in the design and evaluation of visualization tools.

    "summary": "A set of n points in low dimensions takes Theta(n w) bits to store on a w-bit\nmachine. Surface reconstruction and mesh refinement impose a requirement on the\ndistribution of the points they process. I show how to use this assumption to\nlossily compress a set of n input points into a representation that takes only\nO(n) bits, independent of the word size. The loss can keep inter-point\ndistances to within 10% relative error while still achieving a factor of three\nspace savings. The representation allows standard quadtree operations, along\nwith computing the restricted Voronoi cell of a point, in time O(w^2 + log n),\nwhich can be improved to time O(log n) if w is in Theta(log n). Thus one can\nuse this compressed representation to perform mesh refinement or surface\nreconstruction in O(n) bits with only a logarithmic slowdown.",

However, the reliability\nof GPUs in error-intolerant applications is largely unproven. In particular, a\nlack of error checking and correcting (ECC) capability in the memory subsystems\nof graphics cards has been cited as a hindrance to the acceptance of GPUs as\nhigh-performance coprocessors, but the impact of this design has not been\npreviously quantified.\n  In this article we present MemtestG80, our software for assessing memory\nerror rates on NVIDIA G80 and GT200-architecture-based graphics cards.\nFurthermore, we present the results of a large-scale assessment of GPU error\nrate, conducted by running MemtestG80 on over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home\ndistributed computing network. Our control experiments on consumer-grade and\ndedicated-GPGPU hardware in a controlled environment found no errors. However,\nour survey over cards on Folding@home finds that, in their installed\nenvironments, two-thirds of tested GPUs exhibit a detectable, pattern-sensitive\nrate of memory soft errors. We demonstrate that these errors persist after\ncontrolling for overclocking and environmental proxies for temperature, but\ndepend strongly on board architecture.",

This paper proposes a watermarking scheme that can embed a watermark to an\narbitrarily shaped object in an image. Before embedding, the image owner\nspecifies an object of arbitrary shape that is of a concern to him. Then the\nobject is transformed into the wavelet domain using in place lifting shape\nadaptive DWT(SADWT) and a watermark is embedded by modifying the wavelet\ncoefficients. In order to make the watermark robust and transparent, the\nwatermark is embedded in the average of wavelet blocks using the visual model\nbased on the human visual system. Wavelet coefficients n least significant bits\n(LSBs) are adjusted in concert with the average. Simulation results shows that\nthe proposed watermarking scheme is perceptually invisible and robust against\nmany attacks such as lossy compression (e.g.JPEG, JPEG2000), scaling, adding\nnoise, filtering, etc.",

    "summary": "We present a novel approach to finding critical points in cell-wise\nbarycentrically or bilinearly interpolated vector fields on surfaces. The\nPoincar\\e index of the critical points is determined by investigating the\nqualitative behavior of 0-level sets of the interpolants of the vector field\ncomponents in parameter space using precomputed combinatorial results, thus\navoiding the computation of the Jacobian of the vector field at the critical\npoints in order to determine its index. The locations of the critical points\nwithin a cell are determined analytically to achieve accurate results. This\napproach leads to a correct treatment of cases with two first-order critical\npoints or one second-order critical point of bilinearly interpolated vector\nfields within one cell, which would be missed by examining the linearized field\nonly. We show that for the considered interpolation schemes determining the\nindex of a critical point can be seen as a coloring problem of cell edges. A\ncomplete classification of all possible colorings in terms of the types and\nnumber of critical points yielded by each coloring is given using computational\ngroup theory. We present an efficient algorithm that makes use of these\nprecomputed classifications in order to find and classify critical points in a\ncell-by-cell fashion. Issues of numerical stability, construction of the\ntopological skeleton, topological simplification, and the statistics of the\ndifferent types of critical points are also discussed.",

Some application areas of such kind of simulator like musical\nsynthesis, animation or more general, instrumental art have specific\nrequirements as for the \"haptic rendering\" of small movements that go beyond\nthe usual haptic interfaces allow. Object properties variability and different\nsituations of object combination represent important aspects of such type of\napplication which makes that the user can be interested as much in the\nrestitution of certain global properties of an entire object domain as in the\nrestitution of properties that are specific to an isolate object. In the\ntraditional approaches, the usual criteria are founded on the paradigm of\ntransparency and are related to the impedance error introduced by the technical\naspects of the system. As a general aim, rather than to minimize these effects,\nwe look to characterize them by physical metaphors conferring to haptic medium\nthe role of a tool. This positioning leads to firstly analyze the natural human\nobject interaction as a simplified evolutive system and then considers its\nsynthesis in the case of the interactive physical simulation. By means of a\nfrequential method, this approach is presented for some elementary\nconfigurations of the simulator",

    "summary": "This paper presents a modeling process in order to produce a realistic\nsimulation of crowds in the ancient Greek agora of Argos. This place was a\nsocial theater in which two kinds of collective phenomena took place:\ninterpersonal interactions (small group discussion and negotiation, etc.) and\nglobal collective phenomena, such as flowing and jamming. In this paper, we\nfocus on the second type of collective human phenomena, called non-deliberative\nemergent crowd phenomena. This is a typical case of collective emergent\nself-organization. When a great number of individuals move within a confined\nenvironment and under a common fate, collective structures appear\nspontaneously: jamming with inner collapses, organized flowing with queues,\ncurls, and vortices, propagation effects, etc. These are particularly relevant\nfeatures to enhance the realism - more precisely the \"truthfulness\" - of models\nof this kind of collective phenomena. We assume that this truthfulness is\nstrongly associated with the concept of emergence: evolutions are not\npredetermined by the individual characters, but emerge from the interaction of\nnumerous characters. The evolutions are not repetitive, and evolve on the basis\nof small changes. This paper demonstrates that the physically-based interacting\nparticles system is an adequate candidate to model emergent crowd effects: it\nassociates a large number of elementary dynamic actors via elementary\nnon-linear dynamic interactions. Our model of the scene is regulated as a\nlarge, dynamically coupled network of second order differential automata. We\ntake advantage of symbolic non-photorealistic and efficient visualization to\nrender the style of the person, rather than the person itself. As an artistic\nrepresentation, NPR reinforces the symbolic acceptance of the scene by the\nobserver, triggering an immediate and intuitive recognition of the scene as a\nplausible scene from ancient Greece.",

Using\nmulti-spin coding techniques, we are able to accelerate simulations on a single\nGPU by factors up to 35 compared to an optimized single Central Processor Unit\n(CPU) core implementation which employs multi-spin coding. By combining the\nCompute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) with the Message Parsing Interface\n(MPI) on the CPU level, a single Ising lattice can be updated by a cluster of\nGPUs in parallel. For large systems, the computation time scales nearly\nlinearly with the number of GPUs used. As proof of concept we reproduce the\ncritical temperature of the 2D Ising model using finite size scaling\ntechniques.",

According to the\nshape properties, the proposed minimal surface can be classified into four\ncategories with respect to $n=4k-1$ $n=4k+1$, $n=4k$ and $n=4k+2$. The explicit\nparametric form of corresponding conjugate minimal surfaces is given and the\nisometric deformation is also implemented.",

    "summary": "The basic objective of data visualization is to provide an efficient\ngraphical display for summarizing and reasoning about quantitative information.\nDuring the last decades, political science has accumulated a large corpus of\nvarious kinds of data such as comprehensive factbooks and atlases,\ncharacterizing all or most of existing states by multiple and objectively\nassessed numerical indicators within certain time lapse. As a consequence,\nthere exists a continuous trend for political science to gradually become a\nmore quantitative scientific field and to use quantitative information in the\nanalysis and reasoning. It is believed that any objective analysis in political\nscience must be multidimensional and combine various sources of quantitative\ninformation; however, human capabilities for perception of large massifs of\nnumerical information are limited. Hence, methods and approaches for\nvisualization of quantitative and qualitative data (and, especially\nmultivariate data) is an extremely important topic. Data visualization\napproaches can be classified into several groups, starting from creating\ninformative charts and diagrams (statistical graphics and infographics) and\nending with advanced statistical methods for visualizing multidimensional\ntables containing both quantitative and qualitative information. In this\narticle we provide a short review of existing methods of data visualization\nmethods with applications in political and social science.",

Recent advances in 3D animation and rendering software have not\nyet been exploited for the representation of proteins and other biological\nmolecules in an intuitive, animated form. Taking advantage of an open-source,\n3D animation and rendering software, Blender, we developed BioBlender, a\npackage dedicated to biological work: elaboration of proteins' motions with the\nsimultaneous visualization of chemical and physical features. EP and MLP are\ncalculated using physico-chemical programs and custom programs and scripts,\norganized and accessed within BioBlender interface. A new visual code is\nintroduced for MLP visualization: a range of optical features that permits a\nphotorealistic rendering of its spatial distribution on the surface of the\nprotein. EP is represented as animated line particles that flow along field\nlines proportional to the total charge of the protein. Our system permits EP\nand MLP visualization of molecules and, in the case of moving proteins, the\ncontinuous perception of these features, calculated for each intermediate\nconformation. Using real world tactile/sight feelings, the nanoscale world of\nproteins becomes more understandable, familiar to our everyday life, making it\neasier to introduce \"un-seen\" phenomena (concepts) such as hydropathy or\ncharges.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we consider rendering color videos using a non-photo-realistic\nart form technique commonly called stippling. Stippling is the art of rendering\nimages using point sets, possibly with various attributes like sizes,\nelementary shapes, and colors. Producing nice stippling is attractive not only\nfor the sake of image depiction but also because it yields a compact vectorial\nformat for storing the semantic information of media. Moreover, stippling is by\nconstruction easily tunable to various device resolutions without suffering\nfrom bitmap sampling artifacts when resizing. The underlying core technique for\nstippling images is to compute a centroidal Voronoi tessellation on a\nwell-designed underlying density. This density relates to the image content,\nand is used to compute a weighted Voronoi diagram. By considering videos as\nimage sequences and initializing properly the stippling of one image by the\nresult of its predecessor, one avoids undesirable point flickering artifacts\nand can produce stippled videos that nevertheless still exhibit noticeable\nartifacts. To overcome this, our method improves over the naive scheme by\nconsidering dynamic point creation and deletion according to the current scene\nsemantic complexity, and show how to effectively vectorize video while\nadjusting for both color and contrast characteristics. Furthermore, we explain\nhow to produce high quality stippled ``videos'' (eg., fully dynamic\nspatio-temporal point sets) for media containing various fading effects, like\nquick motions of objects or progressive shot changes. We report on practical\nperformances of our implementation, and present several stippled video results\nrendered on-the-fly using our viewer that allows both spatio-temporal dynamic\nrescaling (eg., upscale vectorially frame rate).",

Driven by\nthe findings from our motivational studies, Chameleon provides end users with\nimportant options, offloads tasks that are not absolutely needed in real-time,\nand accomplishes real-time tasks by carefully enhancing the codebase of a\nbrowser engine. According to measure-ments with OLED smartphones, Chameleon is\nable to re-duce average system power consumption for web browsing by 41% and\nreduce display power consumption by 64% without introducing any noticeable\ndelay.",

    "summary": "The very recent volume-enclosing surface extraction algorithm, VESTA, is\nrevisited. VESTA is used to determine implicit surfaces that are potentially\ncontained in 3D data sets, such as 3D image data and/or 3D simulation data.\nVESTA surfaces are non-degenerate, i.e., they always enclose a volume that is\nlarger than zero and they never self-intersect, prior to a further processing,\ne.g., towards isosurfaces. In addition to its ability to deal with local cell\nambiguities consistently - and thereby avoiding the accidental generation of\nholes in the final surfaces - the information of the interior and/or exterior\nof enclosed 3D volumes is propagated correctly to each of the final surface\ntiles. Particular emphasis is put here on the speed up of the original\nformulation of VESTA, while applying the algorithm to 2x2x2 voxel\nneighborhoods.",

    "summary": "In computer graphics, smooth data reconstruction on 2D or 3D manifolds\nusually refers to subdivision problems. Such a method is only valid based on\ndense sample points. The manifold usually needs to be triangulated into meshes\n(or patches) and each node on the mesh will have an initial value. While the\nmesh is refined the algorithm will provide a smooth function on the redefined\nmanifolds. However, when data points are not dense and the original mesh is not\nallowed to be changed, how is the \"continuous and/or smooth\" reconstruction\npossible? This paper will present a new method using harmonic functions to\nsolve the problem. Our method contains the following steps: (1) Partition the\nboundary surfaces of the 3D manifold based on sample points so that each sample\npoint is on the edge of the partition. (2) Use gradually varied interpolation\non the edges so that each point on edge will be assigned a value. In addition,\nall values on the edge are gradually varied. (3) Use discrete harmonic function\nto fit the unknown points, i.e. the points inside each partition patch.\n  The fitted function will be a harmonic or a local harmonic function in each\npartitioned area. The function on edge will be \"near\" continuous (or \"near\"\ngradually varied). If we need a smoothed surface on the manifold, we can apply\nsubdivision algorithms. This paper has also a philosophical advantage over\ntriangulation meshes. People usually use triangulation for data reconstruction.\nThis paper employs harmonic functions, a generalization of triangulation\nbecause linearity is a form of harmonic. Therefore, local harmonic\ninitialization is more sophisticated then triangulation. This paper is a\nconceptual and methodological paper. This paper does not focus on detailed\nmathematical analysis nor fine algorithm design.",

We propose to define\ntopology-based geometric objects as labelled graphs. The arc labelling defines\nthe topological structure of the object whose topological consistency is then\nensured by labelling constraints.

    "summary": "Given the ever increasing bandwidth of the visual information available to\nmany intelligent systems, it is becoming essential to endow them with a sense\nof what is worthwhile their attention and what can be safely disregarded. This\narticle presents a general mathematical framework to efficiently allocate the\navailable computational resources to process the parts of the input that are\nrelevant to solve a given perceptual problem. By this we mean to find the\nhypothesis H (i.e., the state of the world) that maximizes a function L(H),\nrepresenting how well each hypothesis \"explains\" the input. Given the large\nbandwidth of the sensory input, fully evaluating L(H) for each hypothesis H is\ncomputationally infeasible (e.g., because it would imply checking a large\nnumber of pixels). To address this problem we propose a mathematical framework\nwith two key ingredients. The first one is a Bounding Mechanism (BM) to compute\nlower and upper bounds of L(H), for a given computational budget. These bounds\nare much cheaper to compute than L(H) itself, can be refined at any time by\nincreasing the budget allocated to a hypothesis, and are frequently enough to\ndiscard a hypothesis. To compute these bounds, we develop a novel theory of\nshapes and shape priors. The second ingredient is a Focus of Attention\nMechanism (FoAM) to select which hypothesis' bounds should be refined next,\nwith the goal of discarding non-optimal hypotheses with the least amount of\ncomputation. The proposed framework: 1) is very efficient since most hypotheses\nare discarded with minimal computation; 2) is parallelizable; 3) is guaranteed\nto find the globally optimal hypothesis; and 4) its running time depends on the\nproblem at hand, not on the bandwidth of the input. We instantiate the proposed\nframework for the problem of simultaneously estimating the class, pose, and a\nnoiseless version of a 2D shape in a 2D image.",

This device can capture highly detailed facial\ngeometry (down to the level of skin pores detail) and Multispectral reflectance\nmap which can be used to estimate biophysical skin parameters such as the\ndistribution of pigmentation and blood beneath the surface of the skin. We\nextend the analysis of the original spherical gradient photometric stereo\nmethod to study the effects of deformed diffuse lobes on the quality of\nrecovered surface normals. Based on our modified radiance equations, we develop\na minimal image set method to recover high quality photometric normals using\nonly four, instead of six, spherical gradient images. Using the same radiance\nequations, we explore a Quadratic Programming (QP) based algorithm for\ncorrection of surface normals obtained using spherical gradient photometric\nstereo. Based on the proposed minimal image sets method, we present a\nperformance capture sequence that significantly reduces the data capture\nrequirement and post-processing computational cost of existing photometric\nstereo based performance geometry capture methods. Furthermore, we explore the\nuse of images captured in our Light Stage to generate stimuli images for a\npsychology experiment exploring the neural representation of 3D shape and\ntexture of a human face.",

Vector field topology is defined\nfor steady vector fields and aims at discriminating the domain of a vector\nfield into regions of qualitatively different behaviour. The presented approach\nrepresents a generalization for saddle-type critical points and their\nseparatrices to unsteady vector fields based on generalized streak lines, with\nthe classical vector field topology as its special case for steady vector\nfields. The concept is closely related to that of Lagrangian coherent\nstructures obtained as ridges in the finite-time Lyapunov exponent field.

    "summary": "Nowadays three dimension (3D) architectural visualisation has become a\npowerful tool in the conceptualisation, design and presentation of\narchitectural products in the construction industry, providing realistic\ninteraction and walkthrough on engineering products. Traditional ways of\nimplementing 3D models involves the use of specialised 3D authoring tools along\nwith skilled 3D designers with blueprints of the model and this is a slow and\nlaborious process. The aim of this paper is to automate this process by simply\nanalyzing the blueprint document and generating the 3D scene automatically. For\nthis purpose we have devised a 3-Phase recognition approach to pseudo 3D\nbuilding generation from 2D floor plan and developed a software accordingly.\nOur 3-phased 3D building system has been implemented using C, C++ and OpenCV\nlibrary [24] for the Image Processing module; The Save Module generated an XML\nfile for storing the processed floor plan objects attributes; while the\nIrrlitch [14] game engine was used to implement the Interactive 3D module.\nThough still at its infancy, our proposed system gave commendable results. We\ntested our system on 6 floor plans with complexities ranging from low to high\nand the results seems to be very promising with an average processing time of\naround 3s and a 3D generation in 4s.

These\nstatistical models represent prior knowledge of the human shape and enable us\nto solve shape reconstruction problems from partial information. Generating\nhuman shape from traditional anthropometric measurements is such a problem,\nsince these 1-D measurements encode 3-D shape information. Combined with a\nstatistical shape model, these easy-to-obtain measurements can be leveraged to\ncreate 3D human shapes. However, existing methods limit the creation of the\nshapes to the space spanned by the database and thus require a large amount of\ntraining data. In this paper, we introduce a technique that extrapolates the\nstatistically inferred shape to fit the measurement data using nonlinear\noptimization. This method ensures that the generated shape is both human-like\nand satisfies the measurement conditions.

As this\ntype of representation is often cumbersome for the user to interpret, tools\nlike ASPVIZ and IDPDraw were developed that allow for visualising answer sets.\nThe tool Kara, introduced in this paper, follows these approaches, using ASP\nitself as a language for defining visualisations of interpretations.

Moreover,\ngeneralising the functionality of previous tools, Kara provides modifiable\nvisualisations such that interpretations can be manipulated by graphically\nediting their visualisations.

This is motivated by the aspiration of students of natural\nscience to understand the continuity of form that unites the diversity of life.\nAt present, scientists using physical traits to study evolutionary\nrelationships among living and extinct animals analyze data extracted from\ncarefully defined anatomical correspondence points (landmarks). Identifying and\nrecording these landmarks is time consuming and can be done accurately only by\ntrained morphologists. This renders these studies inaccessible to\nnon-morphologists, and causes phenomics to lag behind genomics in elucidating\nevolutionary patterns. Unlike other algorithms presented for morphological\ncorrespondences our approach does not require any preliminary marking of\nspecial features or landmarks by the user.

From our results we define higher-level principles that are\nvalid for generic many-core processors, the most important of which is to limit\nthe number of atomic accesses required for a synchronization operation because\natomic accesses are slower than regular memory accesses. We use the results of\nthe benchmarks to critique existing synchronization algorithms and guide our\nnew implementations, and then define an abstraction of GPUs to classify any GPU\nbased on the behavior of the memory system. We use this abstraction to create\nsuitable implementations of the primitives specifically targeting the GPU, and\nanalyze the performance of these algorithms on Tesla and Fermi. We then predict\nperformance on future GPUs based on characteristics of the abstraction.

Notable examples in this family are the heat kernel signature (HKS) and\nthe wave kernel signature (WKS). Laplacian-based descriptors achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in numerous shape analysis tasks; they are\ncomputationally efficient, isometry-invariant by construction, and can\ngracefully cope with a variety of transformations. In this paper, we formulate\na generic family of parametric spectral descriptors. We argue that in order to\nbe optimal for a specific task, the descriptor should take into account the\nstatistics of the corpus of shapes to which it is applied (the \"signal\") and\nthose of the class of transformations to which it is made insensitive (the\n\"noise\"). While such statistics are hard to model axiomatically, they can be\nlearned from examples. Following the spirit of the Wiener filter in signal\nprocessing, we show a learning scheme for the construction of optimal spectral\ndescriptors and relate it to Mahalanobis metric learning. The superiority of\nthe proposed approach is demonstrated on the SHREC'10 benchmark.",

    "title": "Student's T Robust Bundle Adjustment Algorithm",
    "summary": "Bundle adjustment (BA) is the problem of refining a visual reconstruction to\nproduce better structure and viewing parameter estimates. This problem is often\nformulated as a nonlinear least squares problem, where data arises from\ninterest point matching. Mismatched interest points cause serious problems in\nthis approach, as a single mismatch will affect the entire reconstruction. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel robust Student's t BA algorithm (RST-BA). We\nmodel reprojection errors using the heavy tailed Student's t-distribution, and\nuse an implicit trust region method to compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nestimate of the camera and viewing parameters in this model. The resulting\nalgorithm exploits the sparse structure essential for reconstructing\nmulti-image scenarios, has the same time complexity as standard L2 bundle\nadjustment (L2-BA), and can be implemented with minimal changes to the standard\nleast squares framework. We show that the RST-BA is more accurate than either\nL2-BA or L2-BA with a sigma-edit rule for outlier removal for a range of\nsimulated error generation scenarios. The new method has also been used to\nreconstruct lunar topography using data from the NASA Apollo 15 orbiter, and we\npresent visual and quantitative comparisons of RST-BA and L2-BA methods for\nthis application. In particular, using the RST-BA algorithm we were able to\nreconstruct a DEM from unprocessed data with many outliers and no ground\ncontrol points, which was not possible with the L2-BA method.",

    "summary": "This work presents new methods and algorithms for tracking the shape and\ntrajectory of moving reflecting obstacles with broken rays, or rays reflecting\nat an obstacle. While in tomography the focus of the reconstruction method is\nto recover the velocity structure of the domain, the shape and trajectory\nreconstruction procedure directly finds the shape and trajectory of the\nobstacle. The physical signal carrier for this innovative method are ultrasonic\nbeams. When the speed of sound is constant, the rays are straight line segments\nand the shape and trajectory of moving objects will be reconstructed with\nmethods based on the travel time equation and ellipsoid geometry. For variable\nspeed of sound, we start with the eikonal equation and a system of differential\nequations that has its origins in acoustics and seismology. In this case, the\nrays are curves that are not necessarily straight line segments and we develop\nalgorithms for shape and trajectory tracking based on the numerical solution of\nthese equations. We present methods and algorithms for shape and trajectory\ntracking of moving obstacles with reflected rays when the location of the\nreceiver of the reflected ray is not known in advance. The shape and trajectory\ntracking method is very efficient because it is not necessary for the reflected\nsignal to traverse the whole domain or the same path back to the transmitter.\nIt could be received close to the point of reflection or far away from the\ntransmitter. This optimizes the energy spent by transmitters for tracking the\nobject, reduces signal attenuation and improves image resolution. It is a safe\nand secure method. We also present algorithms for tracking the shape and\ntrajectory of absorbing obstacles. The new methods and algorithms for shape and\ntrajectory tracking enable new applications and an application to one-hop\nInternet routing is presented.",

To solve the IK problem, classical methods that rely on\nnumerical solutions often suffer from the under-determination problem and can\nnot guarantee naturalness. Existing data-driven methods address this problem by\nlearning from motion capture data. When facing a large variety of poses\nhowever, these methods may not be able to capture the pose styles or be\napplicable in real-time environment. Inspired from the low-rank motion\nde-noising and completion model in \\cite{lai2011motion}, we propose a novel\nmodel for character posing based on sparse coding. Unlike conventional\napproaches, our model directly captures the pose styles in Euclidean space to\nprovide intuitive training error measurements and facilitate pose synthesis. A\npose dictionary is learned in training stage and based on it natural poses are\nsynthesized to satisfy users' constraints . We compare our model with existing\nmodels for tasks of pose de-noising and completion. Experiments show our model\nobtains lower de-noising and completion error.

Luckily, graphical user\ninterfaces has made a lot of tasks on computers easier to perform and out of\nthe belief that creating computer programs can also be one of them, visual\nprogramming languages (VPLs) have emerged.

Also, the methods for achieving basic\nprinciples of VPLs will be shown -- suitable visual presentation of information\nand guiding the programmer in the right direction using constraints.

    "summary": "Compared with full volume rendering, isosurface rendering has several well\nrecognized advantages in efficiency and accuracy. However, standard isosurface\nrendering has some limitations in effectiveness. First, it uses a monotone\ncolored approach and can only visualize the geometry features of an isosurface.\nThe lack of the capability to illustrate the material property and the internal\nstructures behind an isosurface has been a big limitation of this method in\napplications. Another limitation of isosurface rendering is the difficulty to\nreveal physically meaningful structures, which are hidden in one or multiple\nisosurfaces. As such, the application requirements of extract and recombine\nstructures of interest can not be implemented effectively with isosurface\nrendering. In this work, we develop an enhanced isosurface rendering technique\nto improve the effectiveness while maintaining the performance efficiency of\nthe standard isosurface rendering. First, an isosurface color enhancement\nmethod is proposed to illustrate the neighborhood density and to reveal some of\nthe internal structures. Second, we extend the structure extraction capability\nof isosurface rendering by enabling explicit scene exploration within a\n3D-view, using surface peeling, voxel-selecting, isosurface segmentation, and\nmulti-surface-structure visualization. Our experiments show that the color\nenhancement not only improves the visual fidelity of the rendering, but also\nreveals the internal structures without significant increase of the\ncomputational cost. Explicit scene exploration is also demonstrated as a\npowerful tool in some application scenarios, such as displaying multiple\nabdominal organs.",

    "summary": "Color intensity projections (CIP) have been shown to improve the\nvisualisation of greyscale angiography images by combining greyscale images\ninto a single color image. A key property of the combined CIP image is the\nencoding of the arrival time information from greyscale images into the hue of\nthe color in the CIP image. A few minor improvements to the calculation of the\nCIP image are introduced that substantially improve the quality of the\nvisualisation. One improvement is interpolating of the greyscale images in time\nbefore calculation of the CIP image. A second is the use of hue cycling - where\nthe hue of the color is cycled through more than once in an image. The hue\ncycling allows the variation of the hue to be concentrated in structures of\ninterest. If there is a zero time point hue cycling can be applied after zero\ntime and before zero time can be indicated by greyscale. If there is an end\ntime point hue cycling can be applied before the end time and pixels can be set\nto black after the end time. An angiogram of a brain is used to demonstrate the\nsubstantial improvements hue cycling brings to CIP images. A third improvement\nis the use of maximum intensity projection for 2D rendering of a 3D CIP image\nvolume. A fourth improvement allowing interpreters to interactively adjust the\nphase of the hue via standard contrast - brightness controls using lookup\ntables. Other potential applications of CIP are also mentioned.",

    "summary": "A new generalized Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) was proposed by Rosso\net al in 2010. It is a functional that captures the notions of order/disorder\nand of distance to an equilibrium distribution. The former is computed by a\nmeasure of entropy, while the latter depends on the definition of a stochastic\ndivergence. When the scene is illuminated by coherent radiation, image data is\ncorrupted by speckle noise, as is the case of ultrasound-B, sonar, laser and\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In the amplitude and intensity formats,\nthis noise is multiplicative and non-Gaussian requiring, thus, specialized\ntechniques for image processing and understanding. One of the most successful\nfamily of models for describing these images is the Multiplicative Model which\nleads, among other probability distributions, to the G0 law. This distribution\nhas been validated in the literature as an expressive and tractable model,\ndeserving the \"universal\" denomination for its ability to describe most types\nof targets. In order to compute the statistical complexity of a site in an\nimage corrupted by speckle noise, we assume that the equilibrium distribution\nis that of fully developed speckle, namely the Gamma law in intensity format,\nwhich appears in areas with little or no texture. We use the Shannon entropy\nalong with the Hellinger distance to measure the statistical complexity of\nintensity SAR images, and we show that it is an expressive feature capable of\nidentifying many types of targets.",

    "summary": "Images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of sonar,\nultrasound-B, laser and Synthetic Aperture Radar -- SAR, are affected by\nspeckle noise which reduces the ability to extract information from the data.\nSpecialized techniques are required to deal with such imagery, which has been\nmodeled by the G0 distribution and under which regions with different degrees\nof roughness and mean brightness can be characterized by two parameters; a\nthird parameter, the number of looks, is related to the overall signal-to-noise\nratio. Assessing distances between samples is an important step in image\nanalysis; they provide grounds of the separability and, therefore, of the\nperformance of classification procedures. This work derives and compares eight\nstochastic distances and assesses the performance of hypothesis tests that\nemploy them and maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that tests based on\nthe triangular distance have the closest empirical size to the theoretical one,\nwhile those based on the arithmetic-geometric distances have the best power.\nSince the power of tests based on the triangular distance is close to optimum,\nwe conclude that the safest choice is using this distance for hypothesis\ntesting, even when compared with classical distances as Kullback-Leibler and\nBhattacharyya.",

We propose to adapt haptic guides based on the\nmental activity measured by a BCI system. This novel approach is illustrated\nwithin a proof-of-concept system: haptic guides are toggled during a\npath-following task thanks to a mental workload index provided by a BCI. The\naim of this system is to provide haptic assistance only when the user's brain\nactivity reflects a high mental workload. A user study conducted with 8\nparticipants shows that our proof-of-concept is operational and exploitable.\nResults show that activation of haptic guides occurs in the most difficult part\nof the path-following task. Moreover it allows to increase task performance by\n53% by activating assistance only 59% of the time. Taken together, these\nresults suggest that BCI could be used to determine when the user needs\nassistance during haptic interaction and to enable haptic guides accordingly.",

However, JPEG compression schemes may exhibit unwanted image artifacts\nto appear - such as the 'blocky' artifact found in smooth/monotone areas of an\nimage, caused by the coarse quantization of DCT coefficients. A number of image\nfiltering approaches have been analyzed in literature incorporating\nvalue-averaging filters in order to smooth out the discontinuities that appear\nacross DCT block boundaries. Although some of these approaches are able to\ndecrease the severity of these unwanted artifacts to some extent, other\napproaches have certain limitations that cause excessive blurring to\nhigh-contrast edges in the image. The image deblocking algorithm presented in\nthis paper aims to filter the blocked boundaries. This is accomplished by\nemploying smoothening, detection of blocked edges and then filtering the\ndifference between the pixels containing the blocked edge. The deblocking\nalgorithm presented has been successful in reducing blocky artifacts in an\nimage and therefore increases the subjective as well as objective quality of\nthe reconstructed image.",

This\ncauses inconvenience in data transmission and data storage. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose an effective algorithm for compressing surface\nhomeomorphisms using Fourier approximation of the Beltrami representation. The\nBeltrami representation is a complex-valued function defined on triangular\nfaces of the surface mesh with supreme norm strictly less than 1. Under\nsuitable normalization, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of\nsurface homeomorphisms and the set of Beltrami representations. Hence, every\nbijective surface map is associated with a unique Beltrami representation.\nConversely, given a Beltrami representation, the corresponding bijective\nsurface map can be exactly reconstructed using the Linear Beltrami Solver\nintroduced in this paper. Using the Beltrami representation, the surface\nhomeomorphism can be easily compressed by Fourier approximation, without\ndistorting the bijectivity of the map. The storage memory can be effectively\nreduced, which is useful for many practical problems in computer graphics and\nimaging. In this paper, we proposed to apply the algorithm to texture map\ncompression and video compression. With our proposed algorithm, the storage\nrequirement for the texture properties of a textured surface can be\nsignificantly reduced. Our algorithm can further be applied to compressing\nmotion vector fields for video compression, which effectively improve the\ncompression ratio.",

    "summary": "Registration, which aims to find an optimal 1-1 correspondence between\nshapes, is an important process in different research areas. Conformal mappings\nhave been widely used to obtain a diffeomorphism between shapes that minimizes\nangular distortion. Conformal registrations are beneficial since it preserves\nthe local geometry well. However, when landmark constraints are enforced,\nconformal mappings generally do not exist. This motivates us to look for a\nunique landmark matching quasi-conformal registration, which minimizes the\nconformality distortion. Under suitable condition on the landmark constraints,\na unique diffeomporphism, called the Teichm\\\"uller extremal mapping between two\nsurfaces can be obtained, which minimizes the maximal conformality distortion.\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm, called the\nQuasi-conformal (QC) iterations, to compute the Teichm\\\"uller mapping. The\nbasic idea is to represent the set of diffeomorphisms using Beltrami\ncoefficients (BCs), and look for an optimal BC associated to the desired\nTeichm\\\"uller mapping. The associated diffeomorphism can be efficiently\nreconstructed from the optimal BC using the Linear Beltrami Solver(LBS). Using\nBCs to represent diffeomorphisms guarantees the diffeomorphic property of the\nregistration. Using our proposed method, the Teichm\\\"uller mapping can be\naccurately and efficiently computed within 10 seconds. The obtained\nregistration is guaranteed to be bijective. The proposed algorithm can also be\nextended to compute Teichm\\\"uller mapping with soft landmark constraints. We\napplied the proposed algorithm to real applications, such as brain landmark\nmatching registration, constrained texture mapping and human face registration.\nExperimental results shows that our method is both effective and efficient in\ncomputing a non-overlap landmark matching registration with least amount of\nconformality distortion.",

    "summary": "We address the problem of surface inpainting, which aims to fill in holes or\nmissing regions on a Riemann surface based on its surface geometry. In\npractical situation, surfaces obtained from range scanners often have holes\nwhere the 3D models are incomplete. In order to analyze the 3D shapes\neffectively, restoring the incomplete shape by filling in the surface holes is\nnecessary. In this paper, we propose a novel conformal approach to inpaint\nsurface holes on a Riemann surface based on its surface geometry. The basic\nidea is to represent the Riemann surface using its conformal factor and mean\ncurvature. According to Riemann surface theory, a Riemann surface can be\nuniquely determined by its conformal factor and mean curvature up to a rigid\nmotion. Given a Riemann surface $S$, its mean curvature $H$ and conformal\nfactor $\\lambda$ can be computed easily through its conformal parameterization.\nConversely, given $\\lambda$ and $H$, a Riemann surface can be uniquely\nreconstructed by solving the Gauss-Codazzi equation on the conformal parameter\ndomain. Hence, the conformal factor and the mean curvature are two geometric\nquantities fully describing the surface. With this $\\lambda$-$H$ representation\nof the surface, the problem of surface inpainting can be reduced to the problem\nof image inpainting of $\\lambda$ and $H$ on the conformal parameter domain.\nOnce $\\lambda$ and $H$ are inpainted, a Riemann surface can be reconstructed\nwhich effectively restores the 3D surface with missing holes. Since the\ninpainting model is based on the geometric quantities $\\lambda$ and $H$, the\nrestored surface follows the surface geometric pattern. We test the proposed\nalgorithm on synthetic data as well as real surface data. Experimental results\nshow that our proposed method is an effective surface inpainting algorithm to\nfill in surface holes on an incomplete 3D models based their surface geometry.",

    "summary": "Google Earth (GE) has become a powerful tool for geological, geophysical and\ngeographical modeling; yet GE can be accepted to acquire elevation data of\nterrain. In this paper, we present a real study case of building the discrete\nsurface model (DSM) at Haut-Barr Castle in France based on the elevation data\nof terrain points extracted from GE using the COM API. We first locate the\nposition of Haut-Barr Castle and determine the region of the study area, then\nextract elevation data of terrain at Haut-Barr, and thirdly create a planar\ntriangular mesh that covers the study area and finally generate the desired DSM\nby calculating the elevation of vertices in the planar mesh via interpolating\nwith Universal Kriging (UK) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). The generated\nDSM can reflect the features of the ground surface at Haut-Barr well, and can\nbe used for constructingthe Sealed Engineering Geological Model (SEGM) in\nfurther step.",

Minor components include advanced\nhuman-computer interaction environments, non-linear documentary storytelling,\nand theatre performance. The journey of this research has been unusual because\nit requires a researcher with solid knowledge and background in multiple\ndisciplines; who also has to be creative and sensitive in order to combine the\npossible areas into a new research direction. [...] It focuses on the advanced\ncomputer graphics and emerges from experimental cinematic works and theatrical\nartistic practices. Some development content and installations are completed to\nprove and evaluate the described concepts and to be convincing. [...] To\nsummarize, the resulting work involves not only artistic creativity, but\nsolving or combining technological hurdles in motion tracking, pattern\nrecognition, force feedback control, etc., with the available documentary\nfootage on film, video, or images, and text via a variety of devices [....] and\nprogramming, and installing all the needed interfaces such that it all works in\nreal-time. Thus, the contribution to the knowledge advancement is in solving\nthese interfacing problems and the real-time aspects of the interaction that\nhave uses in film industry, fashion industry, new age interactive theatre,\ncomputer games, and web-based technologies and services for entertainment and\neducation. It also includes building up on this experience to integrate Kinect-\nand haptic-based interaction, artistic scenery rendering, and other forms of\ncontrol.

This paper intends to take further steps towards this resolution,\nbuilding on the literature. For the broad class of hyperdense fractals, a\nverifiable condition guaranteeing intersection with any line passing through\nthe convex hull of a planar IFS fractal is shown, in general R^d for\nhyperplanes. The condition also implies a constructive algorithm for finding\nthe points of intersection.

Initial studies of MR-guidance in gynecologic\nbrachtherapy demonstrate the ability to optimize tumor coverage and reduce\nradiation dose to normal tissues, resulting in improved outcomes for patients.\nIn this article we describe a methodology to aid applicator placement and\ntreatment planning for 3 Tesla (3T) MR-guided brachytherapy that was developed\nspecifically for gynecologic cancers. This has been used in 18 cases to date in\nthe Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating suite at Brigham and Women's\nHospital. It is comprised of state of the art methods for MR imaging, image\nanalysis, and treatment planning. An MR sequence using 3D-balanced steady state\nfree precession in a 3T MR scan was identified as the best sequence for\ncatheter identification with ballooning artifact at the tip. 3D treatment\nplanning was performed using MR images. Item in development include a software\nmodule designed to support virtual needle trajectory planning that includes\nprobabilistic bias correction, graph based segmentation, and image registration\nalgorithms.

A key idea is\nto apply numerous (thousands to millions) in-situ visualizations\nsimultaneously. The viewer then analyzes the image database interactively\nduring postprocessing. If each movie can be compressed to 100 MB, one million\nmovies will only require 100 TB, which is smaller than the size of the raw\nnumerical data in exascale supercomputing. We performed a feasibility study\nusing the proposed method. Multiple movie files were produced by a simulation\nand they were analyzed using a specially designed movie player.

Each dart has d choose k flats, aligned with the coordinate axes for\nefficiency. We show that k-d darts are useful for exploring a function's\nproperties, such as estimating its integral, or finding an exemplar above a\nthreshold. We describe a recipe for converting an algorithm from point sampling\nto k-d dart sampling, assuming the function can be evaluated along a k-d flat.\n  We demonstrate that k-d darts are more efficient than point-wise samples in\nhigh dimensions, depending on the characteristics of the sampling domain: e.g.\nthe subregion of interest has small volume and evaluating the function along a\nflat is not too expensive. We present three concrete applications using line\ndarts (1-d darts): relaxed maximal Poisson-disk sampling, high-quality\nrasterization of depth-of-field blur, and estimation of the probability of\nfailure from a response surface for uncertainty quantification. In these\napplications, line darts achieve the same fidelity output as point darts in\nless time. We also demonstrate the accuracy of higher dimensional darts for a\nvolume estimation problem. For Poisson-disk sampling, we use significantly less\nmemory, enabling the generation of larger point clouds in higher dimensions.",

This paper demonstrates an algorithm which\nachieves this task by learning an internal representation of `normality' from\nsonar scans taken as a robot explores the environment. This model of the\nenvironment is used to evaluate the novelty of each sonar scan presented to it\nwith relation to the model. Stimuli which have not been seen before, and\ntherefore have more novelty, are highlighted by the filter. The filter has the\nability to forget about features which have been learned, so that stimuli which\nare seen only rarely recover their response over time.

    "summary": "Global mobile robot localization is the problem of determining a robot's pose\nin an environment, using sensor data, when the starting position is unknown. A\nfamily of probabilistic algorithms known as Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is\ncurrently among the most popular methods for solving this problem. MCL\nalgorithms represent a robot's belief by a set of weighted samples, which\napproximate the posterior probability of where the robot is located by using a\nBayesian formulation of the localization problem. This article presents an\nextension to the MCL algorithm, which addresses its problems when localizing in\nhighly symmetrical environments; a situation where MCL is often unable to\ncorrectly track equally probable poses for the robot. The problem arises from\nthe fact that sample sets in MCL often become impoverished, when samples are\ngenerated according to their posterior likelihood. Our approach incorporates\nthe idea of clusters of samples and modifies the proposal distribution\nconsidering the probability mass of those clusters. Experimental results are\npresented that show that this new extension to the MCL algorithm successfully\nlocalizes in symmetric environments where ordinary MCL often fails.",

In this\npaper we find a relation between the topological properties of a configuration\nspace (the structure of its cohomology algebra) and the character of\ninstabilities, which are unavoidable in any motion planning algorithm. More\nspecifically, let $X$ denote the space of all admissible configurations of a\nmechanical system. A {\\it motion planner} is given by a splitting $X\\times X =\nF_1\\cup F_2\\cup ... \\cup F_k$ (where $F_1, ..., F_k$ are pairwise disjoint\nENRs, see below) and by continuous maps $s_j: F_j \\to PX,$ such that $E\\circ\ns_j =1_{F_j}$. Here $PX$ denotes the space of all continuous paths in $X$\n(admissible motions of the system) and $E: PX\\to X\\times X$ denotes the map\nwhich assigns to a path the pair of its initial -- end points. Any motion\nplanner determines an algorithm of motion planning for the system. In this\npaper we apply methods of algebraic topology to study the minimal number of\nsets $F_j$ in any motion planner in $X$. We also introduce a new notion of {\\it\norder of instability} of a motion planner; it describes the number of\nessentially distinct motions which may occur as a result of small perturbations\nof the input data.

As fantastic as this idea may seem, recent\ndevelopments in electroactive polymers (EAP) may one day make such bionics\npossible. Polymers that exhibit large displacement in response to stimulation\nthat is other than electrical signal were known for many years. Initially, EAP\nreceived relatively little attention due to their limited actuation capability.\nHowever, in the recent years, the view of the EAP materials has changed due to\nthe introduction of effective new materials that significantly surpassed the\ncapability of the widely used piezoelectric polymer, PVDF. As this technology\ncontinues to evolve, novel mechanisms that are biologically inspired are\nexpected to emerge. EAP materials can potentially provide actuation with\nlifelike response and more flexible configurations. While further improvements\nin performance and robustness are still needed, there already have been several\nreported successes. In recognition of the need for cooperation in this\nmultidisciplinary field, the author initiated and organized a series of\ninternational forums that are leading to a growing number of research and\ndevelopment projects and to great advances in the field.

The research has been developed under the SocRob project, carried\nout by the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at the Institute for Systems and\nRobotics - Instituto Superior Tecnico (ISR/IST) in Lisbon. The acronym of the\nproject stands both for \"Society of Robots\" and \"Soccer Robots\", the case study\nwhere we are testing our population of robots. Designing soccer robots is a\nvery challenging problem, where the robots must act not only to shoot a ball\ntowards the goal, but also to detect and avoid static (walls, stopped robots)\nand dynamic (moving robots) obstacles. Furthermore, they must cooperate to\ndefeat an opposing team. Our past and current research in soccer robotics\nincludes cooperative sensor fusion for world modeling, object recognition and\ntracking, robot navigation, multi-robot distributed task planning and\ncoordination, including cooperative reinforcement learning in cooperative and\nadversarial environments, and behavior-based architectures for real time task\nexecution of cooperating robot teams.",

    "summary": "Mobile robots have received a great deal of research in recent years. A\nsignificant amount of research has been published in many aspects related to\nmobile robots. Most of the research is devoted to design and develop some\ncontrol techniques for robot motion and path planning. A large number of\nresearchers have used kinematic models to develop motion control strategy for\nmobile robots. Their argument and assumption that these models are valid if the\nrobot has low speed, low acceleration and light load. However, dynamic\nmodelling of mobile robots is very important as they are designed to travel at\nhigher speed and perform heavy duty work. This paper presents and discusses a\nnew approach to develop a dynamic model and control strategy for wheeled mobile\nrobot which I modelled as a rigid body that roles on two wheels and a castor.\nThe motion control strategy consists of two levels. The first level is dealing\nwith the dynamic of the system and denoted as Low level controller. The second\nlevel is developed to take care of path planning and trajectory generation.",

Samples are clustered into species, each of\nwhich represents a hypothesis of the robots pose. Since the coevolution between\nthe species ensures that the multiple distinct hypotheses can be tracked\nstably, the problem of premature convergence when using MCL in highly symmetric\nenvironments can be solved. And the sample size can be adjusted adaptively over\ntime according to the uncertainty of the robots pose by using the population\ngrowth model. In addition, by using the crossover and mutation operators in\nevolutionary computation, intra-species evolution can drive the samples move\ntowards the regions where the desired posterior density is large. So a small\nsize of samples can represent the desired density well enough to make precise\nlocalization. The new algorithm is termed coevolution based adaptive Monte\nCarlo localization (CEAMCL). Experiments have been carried out to prove the\nefficiency of the new localization algorithm.",

    "summary": "The approximate nonlinear receding-horizon control law is used to treat the\ntrajectory tracking control problem of rigid link robot manipulators. The\nderived nonlinear predictive law uses a quadratic performance index of the\npredicted tracking error and the predicted control effort. A key feature of\nthis control law is that, for their implementation, there is no need to perform\nan online optimization, and asymptotic tracking of smooth reference\ntrajectories is guaranteed. It is shown that this controller achieves the\npositions tracking objectives via link position measurements. The stability\nconvergence of the output tracking error to the origin is proved. To enhance\nthe robustness of the closed loop system with respect to payload uncertainties\nand viscous friction, an integral action is introduced in the loop. A nonlinear\nobserver is used to estimate velocity. Simulation results for a two-link rigid\nrobot are performed to validate the performance of the proposed controller.\n  Keywords: receding-horizon control, nonlinear observer, robot manipulators,\nintegral action, robustness.",

This dynamics coupling is unique characteristics of\nspace robot system. Such a disturbance will produce a serious impact between\nthe manipulator hand and the object. To ensure reliable and precise operation,\nwe propose to develop a space robot system consisting of two arms, with one arm\n(mission arm) for accomplishing the capture mission, and the other one (balance\narm) compensating for the disturbance of the base. We present the coordinated\ncontrol concept for balance of the attitude of the base using the balance arm.\nThe mission arm can move along the given trajectory to approach and capture the\ntarget with no considering the disturbance from the coupling of the base.

Goals can be programmed. That is\nwhy living organisms give us hope to achieve adaptability in robots. In this\npaper a method for the description of a goal-directed, or programmed,\nbehaviour, interacting with uncertainty of environment, is described. We\nsuggest reducing the structural (goals, intentions) and stochastic components\n(probability to realise the goal) of individual behaviour to random variables\nwith nominal values to apply probabilistic approach. This allowed us to use a\nNormalized Entropy Index to detect the system state by estimating the\ncontribution of each agent to the group behaviour. The number of possible group\nstates is 27. We argue that adaptation has a limited number of possible paths\nbetween these 27 states. Paths and states can be programmed so that after\nadjustment to any particular case of task and conditions, adaptability will\nnever involve chaos.

The net output speed is a combination of the two input\nspeeds and is governed by the transmission ratio of the planetary gear train.\nThis new approach eliminates the use of a torque converter which is otherwise\nan indispensable part of all available automatic transmissions, thereby\nreducing the power loss that occurs in the box during the fluid coupling.

The other advantages of the developed controller are pulling over and\nreversing the vehicle, implemented by intelligent mixing of the dc motor and\nengine speeds. This approach eliminates traditional braking system in entire\nvehicle design. The use of two power sources, IC engine and battery driven DC\nmotor, utilizes the modern idea of hybrid vehicles.

When a snowblower\npasses over each region along the tour, it displaces snow into a nearby region.\nThe constraint is that if the snow is piled too high, then the snowblower\ncannot clear the pile.\n  We give an algorithmic study of the SBP. We show that in general, the problem\nis NP-complete, and we present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for\nremoving snow under various assumptions about the operation of the snowblower.\nMost commercially-available snowblowers allow the user to control the direction\nin which the snow is thrown.

    "summary": "The biologically-inspired swarm paradigm is being used to design\nself-organizing systems of locally interacting artificial agents. A major\ndifficulty in designing swarms with desired characteristics is understanding\nthe causal relation between individual agent and collective behaviors.\nMathematical analysis of swarm dynamics can address this difficulty to gain\ninsight into system design. This paper proposes a framework for mathematical\nmodeling of swarms of microscopic robots that may one day be useful in medical\napplications. While such devices do not yet exist, the modeling approach can be\nhelpful in identifying various design trade-offs for the robots and be a useful\nguide for their eventual fabrication. Specifically, we examine microscopic\nrobots that reside in a fluid, for example, a bloodstream, and are able to\ndetect and respond to different chemicals. We present the general mathematical\nmodel of a scenario in which robots locate a chemical source. We solve the\nscenario in one-dimension and show how results can be used to evaluate certain\ndesign decisions.",

    "summary": "Dynamic task allocation is an essential requirement for multi-robot systems\noperating in unknown dynamic environments. It allows robots to change their\nbehavior in response to environmental changes or actions of other robots in\norder to improve overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms\nfor task allocation that use only local sensing and no direct communication\nbetween robots are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a\nlack of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms difficult\nto design. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a general dynamic\ntask allocation mechanism. Robots using this mechanism have to choose between\ntwo types of task, and the goal is to achieve a desired task division in the\nabsence of explicit communication and global knowledge. Robots estimate the\nstate of the environment from repeated local observations and decide which task\nto choose based on these observations. We model the robots and observations as\nstochastic processes and study the dynamics of the collective behavior.\nSpecifically, we analyze the effect that the number of observations and the\nchoice of the decision function have on the performance of the system. The\nmathematical models are validated in a multi-robot multi-foraging scenario. The\nmodel's predictions agree very closely with experimental results from\nsensor-based simulations.",

Simple distributed controls are then presented in the context of\nprototypical biomedical tasks, which require control decisions on millisecond\ntime scales.

A specific example is monitoring for patterns of\nchemicals in a flowing fluid released at chemically distinctive sites.\nInformation collected from a large number of such devices allows estimating\nproperties of cell-sized chemical sources in a macroscopic volume.

A searchlight is a ray emitted by an agent which cannot\npenetrate the boundary of the environment. A point is detected by a searchlight\nif and only if the point is on the ray at some instant. Targets are points\nwhich can move continuously with unbounded speed. The objective of the proposed\nalgorithms is for the agents to coordinate the slewing (rotation about a point)\nof their searchlights in a distributed manner, i.e., using only local sensing\nand limited communication, such that any target will necessarily be detected in\nfinite time. The first algorithm we develop, called the DOWSS (Distributed One\nWay Sweep Strategy), is a distributed version of a known algorithm described\noriginally in 1990 by Sugihara et al \\cite{KS-IS-MY:90}, but it can be very\nslow in clearing the entire environment because only one searchlight may slew\nat a time. In an effort to reduce the time to clear the environment, we develop\na second algorithm, called the PTSS (Parallel Tree Sweep Strategy), in which\nsearchlights sweep in parallel if guards are placed according to an environment\npartition belonging to a class we call PTSS partitions.

In opposite to serial\nmanipulators, parallel manipulators can admit not only multiple inverse\nkinematic solutions, but also multiple direct kinematic solutions. This\nproperty produces more complicated kinematic models but allows more flexibility\nin trajectory planning. To take into account this property, the notion of\naspects, i.e. the maximal singularity-free domains, was introduced, based on\nthe notion of working modes, which makes it possible to separate the inverse\nkinematic solutions.

This manipulator is obtained by\nadding in series to a five-bar planar mechanism (similar to the one studied by\nBajpai and Roth) a third revolute passing through the line of centers of the\ntwo actuated revolute joints of the above linkage. The resulting architecture\nis hybrid in that it has both serial and parallel links. Fully-parallel\nmanipulators are known for the existence of particularly undesirable\nsingularities (referred to as parallel singularities) where control is lost [4]\nand [6]. On the other hand, due to their cantilever type of kinematic\narrangement, fully serial manipulators suffer from a lack of stiffness and from\nrelatively large positioning errors. The hybrid manipulator studied is\nintrinsically stiffer and more accurate. Furthermore, since all actuators are\nlocated on the first axis, the inertial effects are considerably reduced. In\naddition, it is shown that the special kinematic structure of our manipulator\nhas the potential of avoiding parallel singularities by a suitable choice of\nthe \"working mode\", thus leading to larger workspaces. The influence of the\ndifferent structural dimensions (e.g. the link lengths) on the kinematic and\nmechanical properties are analysed in view of the optimal design of such hybrid\nmanipulators.",

    "summary": "Most industrial machine tools have a serial kinematic architecture, which\nmeans that each axis has to carry the following one, including its actuators\nand joints. High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of such\narchitectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure high\nstiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limit\nthe dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more and\nmore researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several\nadvantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and\nhigh dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the\nlinks provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia\neffects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a\nparallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further\nresearch studies before wide industrial use can be expected. Many criteria need\nto be taken into account in the design of a PKMT. We pay special attention to\nthe description of kinetostatic criteria that rely on the conditioning of the\nJacobian matrix of the mechanism. The organisation of this paper is as follows:\nnext section introduces general remarks about PKMs, then is explained why PKMs\ncan be interesting alternative machine tool designs. Then are presented\nexisting PKMTs. An application to the design of a small-scale machine tool\nprototype developed at IRCCyN is presented at the end of this paper.",

The aim of this paper is to use a simple parallel mechanism with\ntwo-degree-of-freedom (dof) for translational motions and to add one leg to\nhave one-dof rotational motion. The kinematics and singular configurations are\nstudied as well as an optimization method. The three-degree-of-freedom\nmechanisms analyzed in this paper can be extended to four-axis machines by\nadding a fourth axis in series with the first two.",

But, unlike what arises in\nnon-degenerate cases, this double root yields two sets of solutions for the\nposition coordinates (x, y) of the platform. In the second situation, we show\nthat the forward kinematics degenerates over the whole joint space if the base\nand platform triangles are congruent and the platform triangle is rotated by\n180 deg about one of its sides. For these \"degenerate\" manipulators, which are\ndefined here for the first time, the forward kinematics is reduced to the\nsolution of a 3rd-degree polynomial and a quadratics in sequence. Such\nmanipulators constitute, in turn, a new family of analytic planar manipulators\nthat would be more suitable for industrial applications.",

What isotropy brings about is\nrobustness to manufacturing, assembly, and measurement errors, thereby\nguaranteeing a maximum orientation accuracy. In this paper we investigate the\nexistence of redundant isotropic architectures, which should add to the\ndexterity of the wrist under design by virtue of its extra degree of freedom.\nThe problem formulation, for, leads to a system of eight quadratic equations\nwith eight unknowns. The Bezout number of this system is thus 2^8=256, its BKK\nbound being 192. However, the actual number of solutions is shown to be 32. We\nlist all solutions of the foregoing algebraic problem. All these solutions are\nreal, but distinct solutions do not necessarily lead to distinct manipulators.\nUpon discarding those algebraic solutions that yield no new wrists, we end up\nwith exactly eight distinct architectures, the eight corresponding manipulators\nbeing displayed at their isotropic postures.",

However, in order to be able to avoid\ndefinitively physical model, old support of the design, without loss of\ninformation, new tools must be available. Especially, a tool making it possible\nto check simply and quickly the maintainability of complex mechanical sets\nusing the numerical model is necessary.

The simulation of human tasks can be carried out either by\nrobot-like simulation or by simulation by motion capture. This paper presents\nsome results on the both two methods. The first method is based on a\nmulti-agent system and on a digital mock-up technology, to assess an efficient\npath planner for a manikin or a robot for access and visibility task taking\ninto account ergonomic constraints or joint and mechanical limits. In order to\nsolve this problem, the human operator is integrated in the process\noptimization to contribute to a global perception of the environment. This\noperator cooperates, in real-time, with several automatic local elementary\nagents. In the case of the second approach, we worked with the CEA and EADS/CCR\nto solve the constraints related to the evolution of human virtual in its\nenvironment on the basis of data resulting from motion capture system. An\napproach using of the virtual guides was developed to allow to the user the\nrealization of precise trajectory in absence of force feedback.

These two motions are decoupled to simplify the direct and inverse\nkinematics, as it is needed for real-times control. To reduce the inertial\nload, the motors are fixed on the base and a transmission with two universal\njoints is used to transmit the rotational motions from the base to the\nend-effector. The main feature of the orthoglide and of the agile eye mechanism\nis the existence of an isotropic configuration. The length of the legs and the\nrange limits of the orthoglide are optimized to have homogeneous performance\nthroughout the Cartesian workspace, which has a nearly cubic workspace. These\nproperties permit to have a high stiffness throughout the workspace and\nworkspace limits that are easily understandable by the user.",

The platform moves in the Cartesian space with fixed\norientation, similar to conventional XYZ-machine. Three strategies have been\nproposed to define the Orthoglide geometric parameters (manipulator link\nlengths and actuated joint limits) as functions of a cubic workspace size and\ndextrous properties expressed by bounds on the velocity transmission factors,\nmanipulability or the Jacobian condition number. Low inertia and intrinsic\nstiffness have been set as additional design goals expressed by the minimal\nlink length requirement.

Jernes idiotypic-network theory has proved the most\npopular artificial-immune-system (AIS) method for incorporation into\nbehaviour-based robotics, since idiotypic selection produces highly adaptive\nresponses. However, previous efforts have mostly focused on evolving the\nnetwork connections and have often worked with a single, pre-engineered set of\nbehaviours, limiting variability. This paper describes a method for encoding\nbehaviours as a variable set of attributes, and shows that when the encoding is\nused with a genetic algorithm (GA), multiple sets of diverse behaviours can\ndevelop naturally and rapidly, providing much greater scope for flexible\nbehaviour-selection. The algorithm is tested extensively with a simulated\ne-puck robot that navigates around a maze by tracking colour.

However, this\ndownwash is also accompanied by an upwash that can beneficial to the followers\nwing flying behind the leaders one, namely a favorable lift for the followers\nwing. How much contributions of the leaders wing to the followers wing in the V\nformation flight is determined by the strength of tip vortices generated by the\nleaders wing which is influenced by its position and shape including incidence\nangle, dihedral angle, aspect ratio and taper ratio. The prediction of\naerodynamic performances of the V flight formation including lift, drag and\nmoment coefficients is numerically performed by solving Navier Stokes equations\nwith k e turbulence model. The computational domain is defined with multiblock\ntopology to capture the complex geometry arrangement of the V flight formation.",

The input frequency swept is generated automatically as part of\nthe autopilot control command.

    "title": "Onboard Multivariable Controller Design for a Small Scale Helicopter\n  Using Coefficient Diagram Method",
    "summary": "A mini scale helicopter exhibits not only increased sensitivity to control\ninputs and disturbances, but also higher bandwidth of its dynamics. These\nproperties make model helicopters, as a flying robot, more difficult to\ncontrol. The dynamics model accuracy will determine the performance of the\ndesigned controller. It is attractive in this regards to have a controller that\ncan accommodate the unmodeled dynamics or parameter changes and perform well in\nsuch situations. Coefficient Diagram Method (CDM) is chosen as the candidate to\nsynthesize such a controller due to its simplicity and convenience in\ndemonstrating integrated performance measures including equivalent time\nconstant, stability indices and robustness. In this study, CDM is implemented\nfor a design of multivariable controller for a small scale helicopter during\nhover and cruise flight. In the synthesis of MIMO CDM, good design common sense\nbased on hands-on experience is necessary. The low level controller algorithm\nis designed as part of hybrid supervisory control architecture to be\nimplemented on an onboard computer system. Its feasibility and performance are\nevaluated based on its robustness, desired time domain system responses and\ncompliance to hard-real time requirements.",

    "summary": "The last decade has witnessed increasing worldwide interest in the research\nof underwater robotics with particular focus on the area of autonomous\nunderwater vehicles (AUVs). The underwater robotics technology has enabled\nhuman to access the depth of the ocean to conduct environmental surveys,\nresources mapping as well as scientific and military missions. This capability\nis especially valuable for countries with major water or oceanic resources. As\nan archipelagic nation with more than 13,000 islands, Indonesia has one of the\nmost abundant living and non-organic oceanic resources. The needs for the\nmapping, exploration, and environmental preservation of the vast marine\nresources are therefore imperative. The challenge of the deep water exploration\nhas been the complex issues associated with hazardous and unstructured undersea\nand sea-bed environments. The paper reports the design, development and testing\nefforts of underwater vehicle that have been conducted at Institut Teknologi\nBandung. Key technology areas have been identified and step-by-step development\nis presented in conjunction with the need to meet the challenge of underwater\nvehicle operation.

    "summary": "A rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicle exhibits more complex properties\ncompared to its full-size counterparts due to its increased sensitivity to\ncontrol inputs and disturbances and higher bandwidth of its dynamics. As an\naerial vehicle with vertical take-off and landing capability, the helicopter\nspecifically poses a difficult problem of transition between forward flight and\nunstable hover and vice versa. The LPV control technique explicitly takes into\naccount the change in performance due to the real-time parameter variations.\nThe technique therefore theoretically guarantees the performance and robustness\nover the entire operating envelope. In this study, we investigate a new\napproach implementing model identification for use in the LPV control\nframework. The identification scheme employs recursive least square technique\nimplemented on the LPV system represented by dynamics of helicopter during a\ntransition. The airspeed as the scheduling of parameter trajectory is not\nassumed to vary slowly. The exclusion of slow parameter change requirement\nallows for the application of the algorithm for aggressive maneuvering\ncapability without the need of expensive computation. The technique is tested\nnumerically and will be validated in the autonomous flight of a small scale\nhelicopter.",

    "summary": "The control of small-scale helicopter is a MIMO problem. To use of classical\ncontrol approach to formally solve a MIMO problem, one needs to come up with\nmultidimensional Root Locus diagram to tune the control parameters. The problem\nwith the required dimension of the RL diagram for MIMO design has forced the\ndesign procedure of classical approach to be conducted in cascaded multi-loop\nSISO system starting from the innermost loop outward. To implement this control\napproach for a helicopter, a pitch and roll attitude control system is often\nsubordinated to a, respectively, longitudinal and lateral velocity control\nsystem in a nested architecture. The requirement for this technique to work is\nthat the inner attitude control loop must have a higher bandwidth than the\nouter velocity control loop which is not the case for high performance mini\nhelicopter. To address the above problems, an algebraic design approach is\nproposed in this work. The designed control using s-CDM approach is\ndemonstrated for hovering control of small-scale helicopter simultaneously\nsubjected to plant parameter uncertainties and wind disturbances.",

However, real-life laser scanning\nof useful accuracy does not allow the robot to scan continuously while in\nmotion; instead, it has to stop each time it surveys its environment. This\nrequirement was studied by Fekete, Klein and Nuechter for the subproblem of\nlooking around a corner, but until now has not been considered in an online\nsetting for whole polygonal regions.\n  We give the first algorithmic results for this important algorithmic problem\nthat combines stationary art gallery-type aspects with watchman-type issues in\nan online scenario: We demonstrate that even for orthoconvex polygons, a\ncompetitive strategy can be achieved only for limited aspect ratio A (the ratio\nof the maximum and minimum edge length of the polygon), i.e., for a given lower\nbound on the size of an edge; we give a matching upper bound by providing an\nO(log A)-competitive strategy for simple rectilinear polygons, using the\nassumption that each edge of the polygon has to be fully visible from some scan\npoint.",

    "summary": "In this paper, our focus is on certain applications for mobile robotic\nnetworks, where reconfiguration is driven by factors intrinsic to the network\nrather than changes in the external environment. In particular, we study a\nversion of the coverage problem useful for surveillance applications, where the\nobjective is to position the robots in order to minimize the average distance\nfrom a random point in a given environment to the closest robot. This problem\nhas been well-studied for omni-directional robots and it is shown that optimal\nconfiguration for the network is a centroidal Voronoi configuration and that\nthe coverage cost belongs to $\\Theta(m^{-1/2})$, where $m$ is the number of\nrobots in the network. In this paper, we study this problem for more realistic\nmodels of robots, namely the double integrator (DI) model and the differential\ndrive (DD) model. We observe that the introduction of these motion constraints\nin the algorithm design problem gives rise to an interesting behavior. For a\n\\emph{sparser} network, the optimal algorithm for these models of robots mimics\nthat for omni-directional robots. We propose novel algorithms whose\nperformances are within a constant factor of the optimal asymptotically (i.e.,\nas $m \\to +\\infty$). In particular, we prove that the coverage cost for the DI\nand DD models of robots is of order $m^{-1/3}$. Additionally, we show that, as\nthe network grows, these novel algorithms outperform the conventional\nalgorithm; hence necessitating a reconfiguration in the network in order to\nmaintain optimal quality of service.",

The results achieved\nshowed that the strategies based on temperamental decision mechanism strongly\ninfluence the system performance and there are evident dependency between\nemotional state of the agents and their temperamental type, as well as the\ndependency between the team performance and the temperamental configuration of\nthe team members, and this enable us to conclude that the modular approach to\nemotional programming based on temperamental theory is the good choice to\ndevelop computational mind models for emotional behavioral Multi-Agent systems.",

    "summary": "We define and study exact, efficient representations of realization spaces of\na natural class of underconstrained 2D Euclidean Distance Constraint\nSystems(EDCS) or Frameworks based on 1-dof Henneberg-I graphs. Each\nrepresentation corresponds to a choice of parameters and yields a different\nparametrized configuration space. Our notion of efficiency is based on the\nalgebraic complexities of sampling the configuration space and of obtaining a\nrealization from the sample (parametrized) configuration. Significantly, we\ngive purely combinatorial characterizations that capture (i) the class of\ngraphs that have efficient configuration spaces and (ii) the possible choices\nof representation parameters that yield efficient configuration spaces for a\ngiven graph. Our results automatically yield an efficient algorithm for\nsampling realizations, without missing extreme or boundary realizations. In\naddition, our results formally show that our definition of efficient\nconfiguration space is robust and that our characterizations are tight. We\nchoose the class of 1-dof Henneberg-I graphs in order to take the next step in\na systematic and graded program of combinatorial characterizations of efficient\nconfiguration spaces. In particular, the results presented here are the first\ncharacterizations that go beyond graphs that have connected and convex\nconfiguration spaces.",

However, in order to be able to avoid definitively physical\nmodel without loss of information, new tools must be available.

Since one\ndecade, the MCM team of IRCCyN works on the creation of tools for the\ngeneration and the analysis of trajectories of virtual mannequins. The\nsimulation of human tasks can be carried out either by robot-like simulation or\nby simulation by motion capture. This paper presents some results on the both\ntwo methods. The first method is based on a multi-agent system and on a digital\nmock-up technology, to assess an efficient path planner for a manikin or a\nrobot for access and visibility task taking into account ergonomic constraints\nor joint limits. The human operator is integrated in the process optimisation\nto contribute to a global perception of the environment. This operator\ncooperates, in real-time, with several automatic local elementary agents. In\nthe second method, we worked with the CEA and EADS/CCR to solve the constraints\nrelated to the evolution of human virtual in its environment on the basis of\ndata resulting from motion capture system.

SUMMARY: The final\ngoal of robots is to allow safer and more homogeneous outcomes with less\nvariability of surgeon performance, as well as new tools to perform tasks on\nthe basis of medical transcutaneous imaging, in a less invasive way, at lower\ncosts. It is expected that improvements for a remote system could be augmented\nin reality, with haptic feedback, size reduction, and development of new tools\nfor natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery. The paradigm of\nimage-guided robots is close to clinical availability and the most advanced\nrobots are presented with end-user technical assessments. It is also notable\nthat the potential of robots lies much further ahead than the accomplishments\nof the daVinci system. The integration of imaging with robotics holds a\nsubstantial promise, because this can accomplish tasks otherwise impossible.\nImage-guided robots have the potential to offer a paradigm shift.",

The majority of this work consists of computational models of\nemotion recognition, computational modeling of causal factors of emotion and\nemotion expression through rendered and robotic faces. A smaller part is\nconcerned with modeling the effects of emotion, formal modeling of cognitive\nappraisal theory and models of emergent emotions. Part of the motivation for\naffective computing as a field is to better understand emotional processes\nthrough computational modeling. One of the four major topics in affective\ncomputing is computers that have emotions (the others are recognizing,\nexpressing and understanding emotions). A critical and neglected aspect of\nhaving emotions is the experience of emotion (Barrett, Mesquita, Ochsner, and\nGross, 2007): what does the content of an emotional episode look like, how does\nthis content change over time and when do we call the episode emotional. Few\nmodeling efforts have these topics as primary focus. The launch of a journal on\nsynthetic emotions should motivate research initiatives in this direction, and\nthis research should have a measurable impact on emotion research in\npsychology. I show that a good way to do so is to investigate the psychological\ncore of what an emotion is: an experience.

    "title": "Dynamic Multi-Vehicle Routing with Multiple Classes of Demands",
    "summary": "In this paper we study a dynamic vehicle routing problem in which there are\nmultiple vehicles and multiple classes of demands. Demands of each class arrive\nin the environment randomly over time and require a random amount of on-site\nservice that is characteristic of the class. To service a demand, one of the\nvehicles must travel to the demand location and remain there for the required\non-site service time. The quality of service provided to each class is given by\nthe expected delay between the arrival of a demand in the class, and that\ndemand's service completion. The goal is to design a routing policy for the\nservice vehicles which minimizes a convex combination of the delays for each\nclass. First, we provide a lower bound on the achievable values of the convex\ncombination of delays. Then, we propose a novel routing policy and analyze its\nperformance under heavy load conditions (i.e., when the fraction of time the\nservice vehicles spend performing on-site service approaches one). The policy\nperforms within a constant factor of the lower bound (and thus the optimal),\nwhere the constant depends only on the number of classes, and is independent of\nthe number of vehicles, the arrival rates of demands, the on-site service\ntimes, and the convex combination coefficients.",

    "summary": "In this paper we present distributed and adaptive algorithms for motion\ncoordination of a group of m autonomous vehicles. The vehicles operate in a\nconvex environment with bounded velocity and must service demands whose time of\narrival, location and on-site service are stochastic; the objective is to\nminimize the expected system time (wait plus service) of the demands. The\ngeneral problem is known as the m-vehicle Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem\n(m-DTRP). The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized\na-priori task assignment and are not robust against changes in the environment,\ne.g. changes in load conditions; therefore, they are of limited applicability\nin scenarios involving ad-hoc networks of autonomous vehicles operating in a\ntime-varying environment. First, we present a new class of policies for the\n1-DTRP problem that: (i) are provably optimal both in light- and heavy-load\ncondition, and (ii) are adaptive, in particular, they are robust against\nchanges in load conditions. Second, we show that partitioning policies, whereby\nthe environment is partitioned among the vehicles and each vehicle follows a\ncertain set of rules in its own region, are optimal in heavy-load conditions.\nFinally, by combining the new class of algorithms for the 1-DTRP with suitable\npartitioning policies, we design distributed algorithms for the m-DTRP problem\nthat (i) are spatially distributed, scalable to large networks, and adaptive to\nnetwork changes, (ii) are within a constant-factor of optimal in heavy-load\nconditions and stabilize the system in any load condition.

Robots are\noblivious-- they do not recall the past computations -- and are allowed to move\nin a one-dimensional space. Additionally, robots cannot communicate directly,\ninstead they obtain system related information only via visual sensors. We draw\na connection between the convergence problem in robot networks, and the\ndistributed \\emph{approximate agreement} problem (that requires correct\nprocesses to decide, for some constant $\\epsilon$, values distance $\\epsilon$\napart and within the range of initial proposed values). Surprisingly, even\nthough specifications are similar, the convergence implementation in robot\nnetworks requires specific assumptions about synchrony and Byzantine\nresilience. In more details, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for\nthe convergence of mobile robots despite a subset of them being Byzantine (i.e.\nthey can exhibit arbitrary behavior). Additionally, we propose a deterministic\nconvergence algorithm for robot networks and analyze its correctness and\ncomplexity in various synchrony settings. The proposed algorithm tolerates f\nByzantine robots for (2f+1)-sized robot networks in fully synchronous networks,\n(3f+1)-sized in semi-synchronous networks.

    "summary": "The power available to microscopic robots (nanorobots) that oxidize\nbloodstream glucose while aggregated in circumferential rings on capillary\nwalls is evaluated with a numerical model using axial symmetry and\ntime-averaged release of oxygen from passing red blood cells. Robots about one\nmicron in size can produce up to several tens of picowatts, in steady-state, if\nthey fully use oxygen reaching their surface from the blood plasma. Robots with\npumps and tanks for onboard oxygen storage could collect oxygen to support\nburst power demands two to three orders of magnitude larger. We evaluate\neffects of oxygen depletion and local heating on surrounding tissue. These\nresults give the power constraints when robots rely entirely on ambient\navailable oxygen and identify aspects of the robot design significantly\naffecting available power. More generally, our numerical model provides an\napproach to evaluating robot design choices for nanomedicine treatments in and\nnear capillaries.",

    "summary": "In 2004, Klavins et al. introduced the use of graph grammars to describe --\nand to program -- systems of self-assembly. We show that these graph grammars\ncan be embedded in a graph rewriting characterization of distributed systems\nthat was proposed by Degano and Montanari over twenty years ago. We apply this\nembedding to generalize Soloveichik and Winfree's local determinism criterion\n(for achieving a unique terminal assembly), from assembly systems of 4-sided\ntiles that embed in the plane, to arbitrary graph assembly systems. We present\na partial converse of the embedding result, by providing sufficient conditions\nunder which systems of distributed processors can be simulated by graph\nassembly systems topologically, in the plane, and in 3-space. We conclude by\ndefining a new complexity measure: \"surface cost\" (essentially the convex hull\nof the space inhabited by agents at the conclusion of a self-assembled\ncomputation). We show that, for growth-bounded graphs, executing a subroutine\nto find a Maximum Independent Set only increases the surface cost of a\nself-assembling computation by a constant factor. We obtain this complexity\nbound by using the simulation results to import the distributed computing\nnotions of \"local synchronizer\" and \"deterministic coin flipping\" into\nself-assembly.",

In these\nsettings, oblivious anonymous robots with arbitrary initial positions are\nrequired to eventually converge to an a apriori unknown position despite a\nsubset of them exhibiting Byzantine behavior. Our contribution is twofold. We\npropose a deterministic algorithm that solves the problem in the most generic\nsettings: fully asynchronous robots that operate in the non-atomic CORDA model.\nOur algorithm provides convergence in 5f+1-sized networks where f is the upper\nbound on the number of Byzantine robots.

This constrasts\nwith previous results in partially synchronous robots networks, where 3f+1\nrobots are necessary and sufficient.",

    "summary": "A binocular system developed by the author in terms of projective Fourier\ntransform (PFT) of the conformal camera, which numerically integrates the head,\neyes, and visual cortex, is used to process visual information during saccadic\neye movements. Although we make three saccades per second at the eyeball's\nmaximum speed of 700 deg/sec, our visual system accounts for these incisive eye\nmovements to produce a stable percept of the world. This visual constancy is\nmaintained by neuronal receptive field shifts in various retinotopically\norganized cortical areas prior to saccade onset, giving the brain access to\nvisual information from the saccade's target before the eyes' arrival. It\nintegrates visual information acquisition across saccades. Our modeling\nutilizes basic properties of PFT. First, PFT is computable by FFT in complex\nlogarithmic coordinates that approximate the retinotopy. Second, a translation\nin retinotopic (logarithmic) coordinates, modeled by the shift property of the\nFourier transform, remaps the presaccadic scene into a postsaccadic reference\nframe. It also accounts for the perisaccadic mislocalization observed by human\nsubjects in laboratory experiments. Because our modeling involves\ncross-disciplinary areas of conformal geometry, abstract and computational\nharmonic analysis, computational vision, and visual neuroscience, we include\nthe corresponding background material and elucidate how these different areas\ninterwove in our modeling of primate perception. In particular, we present the\nphysiological and behavioral facts underlying the neural processes related to\nour modeling. We also emphasize the conformal camera's geometry and discuss how\nit is uniquely useful in the intermediate-level vision computational aspects of\nnatural scene understanding.",

The agents are wall following robots as\ndescribed by Steve Mesburger and Alfred Hubler in their paper \"Chaos in Wall\nFollowing Robots\". These agents uses a simple forward facing distance sensor,\nwith a limited field of view \"phi\" for navigation. An agent drives forward at a\nconstant velocity and uses the sensor to turn right when it is too close to an\nobject and left when it is too far away.\n  For a flat wall the agent stays a fixed distance from the wall and travels\nalong it, regardless of the sensor's capabilities. But, if the wall represents\na periodic function, the agent drives on a periodic path when the sensor has a\nnarrow field of view. The agent's trajectory transitions to chaos when the\nsensor's field of view is increased. Numerical experiments were performed with\nsquare, triangle, and sawtooth waves for the wall, to find this pattern. The\nbifurcations of the agents were analyzed, finding both border collision and\nperiod doubling bifurcations. Detailed experimental results will be reported\nseparately.",

The environment is a\nrectangle and the deadline is one of its edges. Targets arrive continuously\nover time on the edge opposite the deadline, and move towards the deadline at a\nfixed speed. The goal for the vehicle is to maximize the fraction of targets\nthat are captured before reaching the deadline. We consider two cases; when the\nservice vehicle is faster than the targets, and; when the service vehicle is\nslower than the targets. In the first case we develop a novel vehicle policy\nbased on computing longest paths in a directed acyclic graph. We give a lower\nbound on the capture fraction of the policy and show that the policy is optimal\nwhen the distance between the target arrival edge and deadline becomes very\nlarge. We present numerical results which suggest near optimal performance away\nfrom this limiting regime. In the second case, when the targets are slower than\nthe vehicle, we propose a policy based on servicing fractions of the\ntranslational minimum Hamiltonian path. In the limit of low target speed and\nhigh arrival rate, the capture fraction of this policy is within a small\nconstant factor of the optimal.",

In many works, these\nsimplified models are used to propose optimal design of robots. However, the\nelasticity of the drive system is often negligible in comparison with the\nelasticity of the elements, especially in applications where high dynamic\nperformances are needed. Therefore, the use of such a simplified model may lead\nto the creation of robots with long legs, which will be submitted to large\nbending and twisting deformations.
