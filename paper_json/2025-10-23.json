    "summary": "Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional performance,\nyet their iterative sampling procedures remain computationally expensive. A\nprominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline\ndistillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity,\nand flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a\nprincipled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed\nthrough the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools\ncan be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose\nstructured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on\nthese observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model (KDM), a novel\noffline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory - a classical\nframework for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space.\nKDM encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator\npropagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples.\nThis enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We\nprovide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions,\nthe learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman\nrepresentation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with\nsemantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory\nalignment. KDM achieves highly competitive performance across standard offline\ndistillation benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as\nstate-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While\nthese models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such\nas images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),\ntranslating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open\nchallenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including\nshared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific\narchitectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this\nwork, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a\ngeneral-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable\nextension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent\nspace, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without\nrequiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to\nenforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a\ndomain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in\nlatent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training\ntoward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training\nstrategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs\nand performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape\ngeneration, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.\nComprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our\nframework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.\nFor more information, see our project page:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/lddbm/home.",

    "summary": "A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that\ngeneralize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical\nconstraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can\nwalk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that\ndecouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner\nlearns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model\nlearns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost\nsimulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that\nlets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that\nthe affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments\nshow that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex\noutdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning\nmethods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied\nnavigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using\nnatural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key\nto embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed\nacross physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model\nsignificantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success\nrates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:\nhttps://vamos-vla.github.io/",

    "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in\nmultimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over\ninformation-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with\nfine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely\nlocalizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate\ndispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free\nframework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight\ndraft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as\ndraft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization\ncandidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to\nproduce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering\ncorrect answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a\nconsensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement\nreasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on\nchallenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering\nbenchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.\nBy synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning\npaths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large\nproprietary models or training pipelines.

However, there\nis no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely \"LLM-generated\ntext\". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further\nincrease the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the\ndetecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can\npotentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle\ninfluences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between\nLLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation\napproaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world\ndetector applications.

    "summary": "Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target\nregion, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,\nare insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image\nmanifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow\nmatching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly\nstronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based\nediting has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the\nfirst framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based\nediting, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first\nshow that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:\nunlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently\nstructured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To\novercome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,\nwhere affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature\nsupervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization\nadapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving\nbackground fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.\nFor evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)\nfeaturing region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on\nDragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and\nregion-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image\nediting.

Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each\nrequiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid\ndeployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a\nquick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can\nadapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.",

This\nformulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the\nresulting \\textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under\nvarying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards\nspecialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain\ndependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,\nthe coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general\ncompetence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\\%).

    "summary": "Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an\nintermediate \"thinking\" process prior to generating final answers, improving\ntheir reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the\npotential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains\nunderexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in\nMT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored\nevaluation materials, tend to \"overthink\" simpler instances and have issues\nwith scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose\nto calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking\ntrajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this\napproach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving\nevaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,\nR1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These\nfindings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance\nfine-grained automatic MT evaluation.",

    "summary": "Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic\nmanipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance\nscale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from\nsim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with\nlimited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided\ndata generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality\nreal-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes\nmanipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory\ndiversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human\ndemonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an\nattraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to\nsuccessful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory\ndiversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments\ngenerated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning.\nExperiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher\nsuccess rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines,\nwhile significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data\ncollection.

The model replicates two key\nfindings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low\nliquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume\n(MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs\n0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with\nGanong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment\nexperiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling\nfor current economic conditions, a \"scarring\" effect documented by Malmendier\nand Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about\nincome risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism\ngenerates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through\nvalue function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation\nresults closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive\nlearning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for\nunderstanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond\nwhat current economic conditions would predict.",

    "summary": "Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,\nambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.\nWhile machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent\nsystems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their\nembeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought\ncommunication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to\ntelepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize\nthe process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are\ngenerated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a\nnonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private\nlatent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the\nglobal structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which\nthoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with\ntheoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a\nframework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication\nand assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing\npatterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as\nmost observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate\nthe collaborative advantages of thought communication.

From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring\nstructures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities\nfor all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue\ndegeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal\ncontrolled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$.

    "title": "Automated Extraction of Fluoropyrimidine Treatment and Treatment-Related\n  Toxicities from Clinical Notes Using Natural Language Processing",
    "summary": "Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast\ncancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and\ncardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical\nnotes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)\nmethods to extract treatment and toxicity information.\n  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical\nnotes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories\nrelated to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine\nlearning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic\nRegression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language\nmodels (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).\nModels used an 80:20 train-test split.\n  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated\ncategories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1\nscores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot\nprompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities\nextraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning\nunderperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and\nClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods\nserved as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in\ntoxicities.\n  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine\nlearning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small\ntraining data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare\ncategories.\n  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine\ntreatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong\npotential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as\ndrafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such\nuses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,\ncontact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private\ninformation, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with\nreal-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations\nrely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking\nreal users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the\nprivacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced\ndifferences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the\nprivacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to\nprivacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants\nusing 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical\nresponses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on\nthe privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,\nwe found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had\nlow correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the\nprivacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and\nproxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses\nin privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct\nuser-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving\nprivacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the\nalignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'\nperceived privacy and utility.",

    "summary": "Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven\nprocess, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected\nacross diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has\nemerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in\nsuch environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication\npresents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor\ndata and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,\nthe complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly\nprediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to\nadvance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential\nstep toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault\nprevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:\n(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,\nand (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is\ncompared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a\npredefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the\nforecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by\nutilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second\nlifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture\ninter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting\nperformance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly\nprediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS\nmodel while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower\ncomputational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for\nonline anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.",

    "summary": "Process reward models (PRMs) have proven effective for test-time scaling of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. However, reward\nhacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement\nfine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward\nhacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement\nlearning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future\nrewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this,\nwe propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation\nof PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as\nthe minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward\nhacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more\nreasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that\nPRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable\nreasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps.\nIn contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even\nat the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with\njust 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce\nthe best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments,\nachieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5\nbenchmarks.

    "summary": "Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision\ntrees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but\nprovide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning\nlarge language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent\nreasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular\ndata. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction\nwith multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy\nOptimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that\nencodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing\nmultiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages\nboth within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense\nlearning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO\nactivates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing\nfew-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong\nbaselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1\napproaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.\nMoreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various\ntasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).",

Based on Anthropic's toy model, we use weight\ndecay to control the degree of superposition, allowing us to systematically\nstudy how loss scales with model size. When superposition is weak, the loss\nfollows a power law only if data feature frequencies are power-law distributed.\nIn contrast, under strong superposition, the loss generically scales inversely\nwith model dimension across a broad class of frequency distributions, due to\ngeometric overlaps between representation vectors. We confirmed that\nopen-sourced LLMs operate in the strong superposition regime and have loss\nscaling like one over the model dimension, and that the Chinchilla scaling laws\nare also consistent with this behavior.

Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to\nwrite policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to\nprivate data is governed.

Moreover, existing policies often\nimplement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to\nprecisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended.\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated\ncode synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be\nused for automatically generating access control policies or aid in\nunderstanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of\nLLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we\nfirst investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding\nthat: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies,\nthey have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given\nspecification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time\nfor reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze\npolicies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach\nwhich leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests\nallowed by a policy.

    "title": "Flow based approach for Dynamic Temporal Causal models with non-Gaussian\n  or Heteroscedastic Noises",
    "summary": "Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in\nmany scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many\nsuch time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments\nwith a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal\nstructure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for\nanalyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this\nsetting is challenging due to (1) non-stationarity, i.e., each regime can have\nits own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,\nwhich may be nonGaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery\napproaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity\nor Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified\nframework for causal discovery that handles non-stationary processes along with\nnon-Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the\nnumber of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's\nDirected Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm\nthat maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log-likelihood. On the\ntheoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal\nheteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are\nidentifiable in both stationary and non-stationary settings. In addition,\nextensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms\nexisting methods.",

    "summary": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as\nspeech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.\nCentral to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity\nto intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two\nclasses: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal\nmodels that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.\nBoth face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural\nnetwork backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited\nsystems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising\nalternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for\nreal-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for\nbattery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a\nscalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.\nOur approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared\nlatent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,\nextract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and\ndecoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113\nrecording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.\nOur method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using\nbetween 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nscaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and\nenables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,\nSpikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework\nbased on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art\nmodels while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.",

In\nthis study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically\nprobing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various\nmodel families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning\nbenchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric.\nSurprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit\nfundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform\ntheir base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher\npass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the\nobserved reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model.\nTreating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that\nsix popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in\nleveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that\ndistillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and\ngenuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities.

The finding of safety neurons\nalso helps explain the ''alignment tax'' phenomenon by revealing that the key\nneurons for model safety and helpfulness significantly overlap, yet they\nrequire different activation patterns for the same neurons.

Using\nstandardized prompts, fixed decoding parameters, and consistent inference\npipelines, we assessed model performance, latency, and token-normalized cost\nunder official pricing. GPT-5 consistently outperformed GPT-4o, with the\nlargest gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as MedXpertQA and\nDiagnosisArena and stable improvements in multimodal QA. In core tasks, GPT-5\nachieved better chemical NER and ChemProt scores but remained below\ndomain-tuned baselines for disease NER and summarization. Despite producing\nlonger outputs, GPT-5 showed comparable latency and 30 to 50 percent lower\neffective cost per correct prediction. Fine-grained analyses revealed\nimprovements in diagnosis, treatment, and reasoning subtypes, whereas\nboundary-sensitive extraction and evidence-dense summarization remain\nchallenging.

However, dental\nimaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic\nartifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity\narising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often\nproves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence\n(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to\nthese issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis\nand treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as\nthe most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature\nextraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent\nprogress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL\nresearch-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260\nstudies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available\ndental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the\nbasic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and\nacquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational\ntechniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to\ndifferent DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization\nstrategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize\ncommonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we\ndiscuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential\nfuture directions.

    "summary": "As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,\nstructural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be\nperpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,\ncensoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model\ndevelopment. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook\ndisparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be\nranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of\nmortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine\nequitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed\nto mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk\nrankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and\napplying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially\nimproves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to\nfairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM\nmaintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest\nimprovements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables\nthe development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in\nclinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical\ncare.",

    "summary": "We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic\ncompute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code\ncompletion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval\nconfigurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)\nchunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.\n(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and\npractical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order\nof magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3\nfamily) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger\nlatency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line\nchunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive\nat 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting\nacross budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across\nconfigurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word\nsplitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide\nevidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG\nsystems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational\nefficiency.",

    "title": "Generalizable Reasoning through Compositional Energy Minimization",
    "summary": "Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in\nreasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than\nthose encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train\nreasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to\nsolutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it\noften results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In\nthis work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning\nenergy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable\nsubproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given\nproblem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This\ncompositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints\nduring inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems\nof increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly\nconstructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).\nWe evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to\ngeneralize to larger and more complex problems.

In this paper, we prove, under certain assumptions, a generalisation\nbound for policy distillation after training.

We empirically verify that these insights hold in\nmore general settings, when the assumptions required for the theory no longer\nhold.

    "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,\ndemonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO.

    "summary": "The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),\nand they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment\non AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is\nlost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and\nits governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and\nthe United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.\nUsing a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited\nfeedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three\ncases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.\nGovernments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for\ncomment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each\nnation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,\nofficials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing\nto create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between\nthe promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude\nthat current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because\npolicymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.\nThey offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;\nbroaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement\nmethods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make\nparticipation easier.",

    "summary": "Existing defence mechanisms have demonstrated significant effectiveness in\nmitigating rule-based Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, leveraging predefined\nsignatures and static heuristics to identify and block malicious traffic.\nHowever, the emergence of AI-driven techniques presents new challenges to SDN\nsecurity, potentially compromising the efficacy of existing defence mechanisms.\nIn this paper, we introduce~AdaDoS, an adaptive attack model that disrupt\nnetwork operations while evading detection by existing DoS-based detectors\nthrough adversarial reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, AdaDoS models\nthe problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to\nobstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to\nidentify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting\nits attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector.\nAdditionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than\ndefenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov\ndecision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay\ninformation between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a\nnovel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited\nobservations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who\nhas full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents\nthe first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of\nadaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack\ndetectors.",

    "summary": "While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware\nmachine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of\nprivacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have\nproposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the\naverage-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate\nthe group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity\nacross group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the\nworst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their\npractical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel\nmembership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case\nprivacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nprovides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a\nreliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to\npromote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD\nalgorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired\nby the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive\nexperiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in\ngroup privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in\nDPML.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of\nmultimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified\nframeworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to\ngeneral-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating\ntheir multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short\ncontexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these\ndimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one\nsingle modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human\nannotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across\nlanguages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce\nMCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual\nhuman-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to\nevaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both\nshort- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,\nvision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and\nChinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret\ninstructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual\ninformation.

We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement\nlearning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.\nGlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with\nreasoning, and refines evidence iteratively.

Despite\nextensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding\nfrom semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720\ncomprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like \"The cat [that the\ndog chased] meowed\") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating\nprocessing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a\nsyntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen\nprescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions\ntesting surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.\nTesting six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and\nimplausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing\nmedian gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon\nstructural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility\nharms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal\nrelationships matters more than semantic coherence.

    "summary": "Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought\nreasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context\ncompression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective\napproaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its\narchitecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this\nspecific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that\ncompresses the context into continuous representations which replace token\nembeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training\nstrategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the\ndesign of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,\nwhich outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically\n$x\\!\\in\\!\\{4,8\\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety\nof LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window\nextension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving\ncomputational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models\ncan be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder\nto generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible\nand efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple\nLLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder\n, fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at\nhttps://huggingface.co/collections/kyutai/arc-encoders-68ee18787301407d60a57047 .",

    "summary": "Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and\nreasoning tasks, showcasing remarkable capabilities. However, the enhancement\nof reasoning abilities and the exposure of internal reasoning processes\nintroduce new safety vulnerabilities. A critical question arises: when\nreasoning becomes intertwined with harmfulness, will LRMs become more\nvulnerable to jailbreaks in reasoning mode? To investigate this, we introduce\nHauntAttack, a novel and general-purpose black-box adversarial attack framework\nthat systematically embeds harmful instructions into reasoning questions.\nSpecifically, we modify key reasoning conditions in existing questions with\nharmful instructions, thereby constructing a reasoning pathway that guides the\nmodel step by step toward unsafe outputs. We evaluate HauntAttack on 11 LRMs\nand observe an average attack success rate of 70\\%, achieving up to 12\npercentage points of absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline.\nOur further analysis reveals that even advanced safety-aligned models remain\nhighly susceptible to reasoning-based attacks, offering insights into the\nurgent challenge of balancing reasoning capability and safety in future model\ndevelopment.",

This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration\nfor Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize\ndocuments, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence\nwith lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to\ncollect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides\nguidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands\nHSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table\nrow/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes\ncanonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional\nrefinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA\n(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1\ngains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high\nefficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic\nunification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and\nKGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that\nreduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and\n(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency\nand auditability.",

    "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across\nmulti-modal tasks by encoding images into thousands of tokens. However, the\nlarge number of image tokens results in significant computational overhead, and\nthe use of dynamic high-resolution inputs further increases this burden.\nPrevious approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens through\ntoken pruning, typically by selecting tokens based on attention scores or image\ntoken diversity. Through empirical studies, we observe that existing methods\noften overlook the joint impact of pruning on both the current layer's output\n(local) and the outputs of subsequent layers (global), leading to suboptimal\npruning decisions. To address this challenge, we propose Balanced Token Pruning\n(BTP), a plug-and-play method for pruning vision tokens. Specifically, our\nmethod utilizes a small calibration set to divide the pruning process into\nmultiple stages. In the early stages, our method emphasizes the impact of\npruning on subsequent layers, whereas in the deeper stages, the focus shifts\ntoward preserving the consistency of local outputs. Extensive experiments\nacross various LVLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our approach on\nmultiple benchmarks. Our method achieves a 78% compression rate while\npreserving 96.7% of the original models' performance on average.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being\nevaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the\nreliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a\nsteering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and\nmake the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering\ntechnique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a\ntwo-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge\nnaturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual\ndescriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not\nduring deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation\ncue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert\niteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model\nis evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than\ndeployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the\nevaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation\nawareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is\npresent. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original\nmodel before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators\ncould improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act\nlike they are deployed.",

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its\neffectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance\nleads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn\ndegrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies\nthis issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This\nstudy proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.\nFollowing a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is\ndecomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of\nnon-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of\nlight-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to\nhandle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by\ntransforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.\nComprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating\nrainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over\nconventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its\nkey advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and\na marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a\ngeneralizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of\nenvironmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact\nevents.",

This study presents the empirical\nevaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs\nacross three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation,\nReview Comment Generation, and Code Refinement.

Our study\ninvestigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural\nlanguages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment\ngeneration. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an\nautomated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their\npractical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual\nfine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual\nbaselines.

    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models\nhave significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song\ngeneration. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex\ncomposition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to\nlimitations in audio quality, musicality, instruction following, and\nvocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, a\nlanguage model based framework consisting of LeLM and Music Codec. LeLM is\ncapable of parallel modeling of two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which\nrepresent the combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve better\nvocal-instrument harmony, and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals\nand accompaniment for high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only\ntransformers and a modular extension training strategy to prevent interference\nbetween different token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction\nfollowing ability, we introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human\npreferences through a semi-automatic data construction process and\npost-training. Experimental results demonstrate that LeVo significantly\noutperforms existing open-source methods in both objective and subjective\nmetrics, while performing competitively with industry systems.

    "summary": "There has recently been a major advance with respect to how information\nfusion is performed. Information fusion has gone from being conceived as a\npurely hierarchical procedure, as is the case of traditional military\napplications, to now being regarded collaboratively, as holonic fusion, which\nis better suited for civil applications and edge organizations. The above\nparadigm shift is being boosted as information fusion gains ground in different\nnon-military areas, and human-computer and machine-machine communications,\nwhere holarchies, which are more flexible structures than ordinary, static\nhierarchies, become more widespread. This paper focuses on showing how holonic\nstructures tend to be generated when there are constraints on resources\n(energy, available messages, time, etc.) for interactions based on a set of\nfully intercommunicating elements (peers) whose components fuse information as\na means of optimizing the impact of vagueness and uncertainty present message\nexchanges. Holon formation is studied generically based on a multiagent system\nmodel, and an example of its possible operation is shown. Holonic structures\nhave a series of advantages, such as adaptability, to sudden changes in the\nenvironment or its composition, are somewhat autonomous and are capable of\ncooperating in order to achieve a common goal. This can be useful when the\nshortage of resources prevents communications or when the system components\nstart to fail.",

With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content\navailable online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring\ncontent authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works\nassessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark\nforging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and\napplied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we\ninvestigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image\nwatermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a\npreference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is\ntrained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without\nany need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to\nremove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through\nbackpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and\nworks without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much\nsimpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we\nevaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking\nmodels, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,\nquestioning the security of current watermarking approaches.

    "summary": "Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description\nlogic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.\nDespite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most\napproaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due\nto their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against\ninconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a\nnovel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to\napproximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely\nrequires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions\nto retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the\ndescription logic $\\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with\nstate-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against\nmissing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.",

Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior\nprobability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement\nwith those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a\nmajor advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable\nmethods rather than sampling methods.

However, most methods\nface three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i)\nFeature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less\ngranular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features,\nthereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity\narises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items,\nyet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the\nentire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented\nintegration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's\neffectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments.

Second, we shift the prediction paradigm\nfrom point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly\nparallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves\ndual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation,\nensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model\nsize.

Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained\ninter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms\nsuch as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically\nrely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level\ncross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse\nmolecular complexities and DDI type distributions.

A central challenge in such joint graph settings is\nthe potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling\nlong-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure\nconsistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the\nglobal structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively\nlearn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,\nachieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.\npatterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI\ntypes.

    "summary": "This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for\nlung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven\nknowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease\ndiagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,\nour method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,\nenabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing\nattention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model\nability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC\nimages. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,\nwhich effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,\nenhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is\nfurther optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the\ntraining procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image\nquality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as\nGamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and\nPix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution\nand feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to\nstandardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale\nfrequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for\nbetter feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model\nfrom a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational\ncost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000\nhistopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images\n(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.",

Specifically, inspired by the research line of neural network repair,\nwe propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum \"patch\" for unlearning a\ngiven data point with certifiable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a\nconsiderable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to\niteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn,\nwhich achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set.

However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the\nmost recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic\nforgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we\npropose \\textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\\&M)}, a novel continual learning framework\nthat integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting.\nSpecifically, after training on each task, P\\&M constructs a new model by\nforming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained\ntask-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, We minimize the total loss\nincrease across all tasks and derive a closed-form solution for the merging\ncoefficient under mild assumptions. To further improve the performance of the\nmerged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be\nalleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian\nmatrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be\nefficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a\nstochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly\ndevised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing\nan effective approximation of the regularization term.

When\naction masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the\nperformance gap narrows considerably.

Unlike conventional FM modules, which use the coarse\nrepresentations from the weak generator as conditions, SFM constructs\nintermediate states along the FM paths from these representations. During\ntraining, we introduce an orthogonal projection method to adaptively determine\nthe temporal position of these states, and apply a principled construction\nstrategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow. The SFM inference starts\nfrom the intermediate state rather than pure noise, thereby focusing\ncomputation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into\nmultiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments demonstrate that\nSFM yields consistent gains in speech naturalness across both objective and\nsubjective evaluations, and significantly accelerates inference when using\nadaptive-step ODE solvers.

Auto-scalers are the systems that enable this elasticity by acquiring\nand releasing resources on demand to ensure an agreed service level. In this\narticle we present FLAS (Forecasted Load Auto-Scaling), an auto-scaler for\ndistributed services that combines the advantages of proactive and reactive\napproaches according to the situation to decide the optimal scaling actions in\nevery moment. The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model\nof the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the\nrelevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or\nthroughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of\nhigh-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary\ninstrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to\ndifferent applications. We provide a FLAS implementation for the use case of a\ncontent-based publish-subscribe middleware (E-SilboPS) that is the cornerstone\nof an event-driven architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst auto-scaling system for content-based publish-subscribe distributed\nsystems (although it is generic enough to fit any distributed service). Through\nan evaluation based on several test cases recreating not only the expected\ncontexts of use, but also the worst possible scenarios (following the\nBoundary-Value Analysis or BVA test methodology), we have validated our\napproach and demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution by ensuring\ncompliance with performance requirements over 99% of the time.",

    "summary": "Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different\nscales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy\nas the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view\nof performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct\ntoken, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.\nYet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in\ngreedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling\nfrom the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based\nProbability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct\ntoken is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we\nestablish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves\nwith increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and\nfour model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the\nrobustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad\napplication of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper\nexplanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental\ntheories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law\ncomplements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete\nunderstanding of scaling large language models.

Rather than\nsharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train\nthe global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy\nguarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy\nleakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the\ntraining data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion\nAttacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to\nreconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using\noptimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually\nreconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be\nenhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update\nInversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion\nmodels as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE\ncan be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely\nadopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach\nin two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets.\nOur results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe-\nart GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple\nmetrics.

However, their inherent\n\\textit{multi-step iterations} and \\textit{complex backbone networks} lead to\nprohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major\nbottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration\ntechniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited\napplicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.\n  Against this backdrop, \\textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising\ntraining-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its\ncore mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in\nthe diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and\ninter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model\nparameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and\nevolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its\nclassification and analysis.\n  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that\nDiffusion Caching evolves from \\textit{static reuse} to \\textit{dynamic\nprediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and\nenables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling\noptimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient\ninference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We\nargue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient\ngenerative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of\n\\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.",

    "summary": "Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of\nhallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive\nuncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating\npredictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been\ndeveloped. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty\nestimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)\ndatasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate\ncorrectness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,\nconsequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows\none to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We\npropose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation\nexperiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms\nfor NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge\nvariants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore\nstructured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection\ntasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we\npropose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an\nobjective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.",

    "summary": "Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks.\nWhile PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language\nmodels (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to\nboth correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical\napplications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled\ndata for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose\nDisagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to\noptimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\\tau$) in post-hoc confidence\ncalibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by\nprediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their\nconfidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence\nunderestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a\nlarger $\\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by\nselectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively\ndecoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an\noverly large $\\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples,\nimproving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and\nAPI-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\\%$ on common benchmarks.",

In this work, we investigate whether LLMs\nexhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,\nTitanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we\nreveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing\nstrong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable\nvalue categories.

Robustness and resilience also varies by\nalgorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize\nacross uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise\nfor all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent.

To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce\nGhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under\nenvironmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving\nbeyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events\ninto realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators\nand evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a\njudge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the\nagent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence,\npinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive\nexperiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to\ndeceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive\nand reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for\nquantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more\nrobust and secure embodied agents.",

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.\nHowever, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into\nreal-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality\nand fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data\ncollection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging\nproject, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect\nbiases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias\nacross multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and\nmeasurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,\nage, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with\npractical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical\nproblem design and data collection.

    "title": "Improving Model Representation and Reducing KV Cache via Skip\n  Connections with First Value Heads",
    "summary": "Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by\ntheir strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them\nto improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and\ncompute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive\ndecoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation\nwithout bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve\nexpressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of\nweaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer\nvariant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to\nstrengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the\nsecond block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very\nfirst layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections\nand V cache by nearly 50 \\%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed\nfirst-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression\nand accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of\nTransformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model\nscales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \\% in\nKV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention\n(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe\nfor uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only\n10-15\\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine\nadvanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to\nachieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined\nwith YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \\% while still improving\nperformance.",

Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute\nunlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often\ninvolve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing\nsingle-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements\ndue to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests\nsimultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic\nunlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight\nand efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide\nthe multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding\nCalibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user\nembedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single\nembedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process\nas a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical\nguarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step\nframework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and\nFlexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2.

    "summary": "Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital\ncontent creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object\ngeneration and layout generation. While recent generative models have\nsignificantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout\ngeneration remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either\noverfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize\nnumerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate\nscenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user\ninstructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates\nnumerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial\nreasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the\ngeneration into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting\nit into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial\nreasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we\nemploy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.\nAdditionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance\ngeneralization and spatial planning.

To address this, we propose a\nlatent-space perturbation framework using a mixed-input Variational Autoencoder\n(VAE) to generate statistically consistent adversarial examples. The proposed\nVAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical features into a unified\nlatent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve statistical consistency.\nWe introduce In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to jointly evaluate attack\neffectiveness and distributional alignment. Evaluation across six publicly\navailable datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method\nachieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance\ncompared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted\nfrom image domain approaches, achieving substantially lower outlier rates and\nhigher IDSR across six datasets and three model architectures. Our\ncomprehensive analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control, and\ngenerative architecture demonstrate that the effectiveness of VAE-based attacks\ndepends strongly on reconstruction quality and the availability of sufficient\ntraining data. When these conditions are met, the proposed framework achieves\nsuperior practical utility and stability compared with input-space methods.\nThis work underscores the importance of maintaining on-manifold perturbations\nfor generating realistic and robust adversarial examples in tabular domains.",

One practical yet\nchallenging problem is how to jointly optimize both system performance and\ngeneration quality in RAG, which is significantly more complex than it appears\ndue to the numerous knobs on both the algorithmic side (spanning models and\ndatabases) and the systems side (from software to hardware). In this paper, we\npresent RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint for quality-performance\nco-optimization in RAG systems.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions\nand model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical\nprinciples. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including\ninternal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced\nscenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model\ncharacter specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle\ncontradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.\n  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force\nexplicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a\ncomprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where\nmodels must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be\nsimultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs\nacross major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral\ndisagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we\nidentify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.\nEmpirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts\nunderlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we\nprovide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct\ncontradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,\nour generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and\nfalse-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we\nalso provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.",

    "summary": "GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI\nelements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats\ninstructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of\ninstruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful\ninvestigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in\ntheir instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction\ndiversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In\nthis paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating\ninstructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives\nand enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.\nTo achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill\nmulti-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to\noptimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and\nUI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding\nbenchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and\nsynthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B\nattains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on\nScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2.

    "summary": "Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language\nmodels (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text\ngeneration, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level\nprediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic\nstructures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this\nlimitation, we introduce \\textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard\npretraining with an inherent \\textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This\nmechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token\ncontexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,\nContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the\nstandard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).\nExtensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to\n$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both\nperplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that\nnext-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger\nlanguage modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective\nattention allocation with minimal computational overhead.",

    "summary": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) incorporates external knowledge into\nlarge language models (LLMs), improving their adaptability to downstream tasks\nand enabling information updates. Surprisingly, recent empirical evidence\ndemonstrates that injecting noise into retrieved relevant documents\nparadoxically facilitates exploitation of external knowledge and improves\ngeneration quality. Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in\npractice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how\nLLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on\nnoise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within\nthe LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate\nlayers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper\nlayers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this\ninsight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that\ndirectly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer\ndecoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge. To identify\nthe optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS)\ncriterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half\nof layers.

Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a\ntask-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and\nmultimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings.

Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to\nthe creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models\n(LLMs).

    "summary": "Metaphors play a critical role in shaping user experiences with Voice User\nInterfaces (VUIs), yet existing designs often rely on static, human-centric\nmetaphors that fail to adapt to diverse contexts and user needs. This paper\nintroduces Metaphor-Fluid Design, a novel approach that dynamically adjusts\nmetaphorical representations based on conversational use-contexts. We compare\nthis approach to a Default VUI, which characterizes the present implementation\nof commercial VUIs commonly designed around the persona of an assistant,\noffering a uniform interaction style across contexts. In Study 1 (N=130),\nmetaphors were mapped to four key use-contexts-commands, information seeking,\nsociality, and error recovery-along the dimensions of formality and hierarchy,\nrevealing distinct preferences for task-specific metaphorical designs. Study 2\n(N=91) evaluates a Metaphor-Fluid VUI against a Default VUI, showing that the\nMetaphor-Fluid VUI enhances perceived intention to adopt, enjoyment, and\nlikability by aligning better with user expectations for different contexts.\nHowever, individual differences in metaphor preferences highlight the need for\npersonalization. These findings challenge the one-size-fits-all paradigm of VUI\ndesign and demonstrate the potential of Metaphor-Fluid Design to create more\nadaptive and engaging human-AI interactions.",

While large\nlanguage models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as\nrole-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes\nremains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that\nevaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a\ndataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the\ntested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to\nbenchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.\nWe hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate\nstorytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different\ncognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and\nprofile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and\nlinguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static\nprofile-based cues in overall evaluation.

    "summary": "Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,\nDeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using\nprompts like \"Wait\" or \"Let me rethink\" can improve performance. This raises a\nnatural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better\nreasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple\nprobabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output\nvariance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately\nundermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true\nindicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection\nbetween model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time\nscaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the\ninference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an\nalternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by\nBest-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths\nwithin the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via\nmajority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended\nthinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling\nof reasoning models.",

    "summary": "Policy exploration is critical in reinforcement learning (RL), where existing\napproaches include greedy, Gaussian process, etc. However, these approaches\nutilize preset stochastic processes and are indiscriminately applied in all\nkinds of RL tasks without considering task-specific features that influence\npolicy exploration. Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such\nstochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the\nvariance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time\nlearning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate\ntask-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy\nexploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the\nagent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the\nagent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability\ndistribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability\ndistribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the\nparticular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our\ndesign is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL\nalgorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants\ndeveloped based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate LLM-Explorer's capability to enhance RL policy\nexploration, achieving an average performance improvement up to 37.27%.

However, few practical approaches achieve the\ngold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples\nexactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the\nselective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition\nof this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation\nerror, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced\nslack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --\noften believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on\nclosing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.\nBridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively\nreorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our\ndecomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language\nbenchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our\nresults confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for\nsubstantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully\nimprove score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that\ndemands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a\nquantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that\npractitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal\noracle behavior more closely.",

In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result\nsolely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?\nAfter a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the\nrisk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased\nreliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.\nBuilding on these insights, we propose a novel \"induce-detect-suppress\"\nframework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed\ncontexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,\nand ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual\ndecoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all\nbenchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved\nhallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,\nre-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance\ngains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step\ntoward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.",

To address these issues, we introduce a\nnovel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).\nMetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared\nhypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in\nlimited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view\nof meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the\nconditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various\nsparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification\naccuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for\nout-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters\nneeded for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication\ncosts. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.",

    "summary": "Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally,\ncloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of\nchoice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have\nquickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the\ninfrastructure in a \"source-of-truth\" configuration. They are capable of\nautomatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating,\nor destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment\nwith the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs,\nor SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure\ndrift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may\nundo valid updates or trigger errors.\n  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates\nout-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that\ninfrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the\nlowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API\ntraces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update\nthe IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic\narchitecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API\nsequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and\ncontinually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past\nreconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting\nrealistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation\nperformance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372\ndrift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of\naccuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\\times$\nimprovement).",

Results\nindicate that while most developers recognize the power of their products to\ninfluence civil liberties and political discourse, they often face ethical\ndilemmas and top-down pressures that can lead to design choices undermining\ndemocratic ideals.

We interrogate the survey findings in the context of the\nSlop Economy, in which billions of users unable to pay for high-quality content\nexperience an internet dominated by low-quality, AI-generated ad-driven\ncontent. We find a reinforcing cycle between tech creator beliefs and the\ndigital ecosystems they spawn.

Routine\nlaboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their\nutility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the\nsevere class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses\nthe feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever\nLifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the\ngrouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A\ncomprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126\nanalytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature\nselection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the\npatient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression\nclassifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated\nmoderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical\nclassification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).\nWhile a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall\n(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis\nwith SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven\nby non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is\nconcluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine\nlab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination\nfrom normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a\ncritical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and\nunderscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will\nrequire integration of multi-modal data sources.",

Many benchmarks have been proposed to measure such ability\nfor Large Language Models (LLMs); however, they focus on few-shot (usually <10)\nsetting and lack evaluation for aggregating many pieces of information from\nlong contexts.

We formalize this phase, link it to known\nphenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset\ndetection.

Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance\ntrade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale\nmodels, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models.

    "summary": "Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their\ndecision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these\nintermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing\nmethods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks\nfor deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core\nchallenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,\nprone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for\nmanual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)\nPrivacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose\nTRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these\nlimitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing\ncorrectness under up to $30\\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG\ndecomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A\nblockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public\naccountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial\nreasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees\nfor the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments\nacross multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,\nmedical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws\nand remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers\ndecentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and\ntrustworthy LLM deployment.",

    "summary": "Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as\none-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images\nusing a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is\npermutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on\narchitectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce\nsensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects\nmodel performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major\nor Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we\npropose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch\norderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the\ncompressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over\npermutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This\napproach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space.\nREOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to\n3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.",

    "summary": "Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for\nreal-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth\nestimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task\nremains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal\nconsistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to\naddress this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental\ntrade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas\ncapturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling\nlong-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo\nmatching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we\npropose a \\textbf{P}ick-and-\\textbf{P}lay \\textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction\nmodule for dynamic \\textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \\textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM\nconsists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a\n`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal\naggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet\nhighly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent\ninformation aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of\nPPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and\ntemporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the\nSintel clean/final (17.3\\% \\& 9.02\\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer\ncomputational costs.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on\nthis task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods\nstrengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and\nhallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table\nmanipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These\ncomplementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust\nreasoning with reliable table processing.

    "title": "RL Tango: Reinforcing Generator and Verifier Together for Language\n  Reasoning",
    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for\nenhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an\nLLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However,\ncurrent RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are\nfixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking\nand generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently\ntrain both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central\ninnovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is\ntrained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is\ntrained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without\nrequiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained\nverifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to\ndeterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual\nreinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both\ncomponents of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models:\nthe generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level\nmath benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the\nverifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit\nparticularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical\nreasoning problems. Code is at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/rl-tango.",

    "summary": "Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer\nfrom inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures\narising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of\nrisk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation\nparadigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the\nunderlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk\nconcept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk\nsubspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit\nrisk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual\nreasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we\npropose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages\nmulti-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and\nemploys dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept\ndistributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit\nand implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the\neffectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising\n800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and\npublic benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline\nevaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,\nand self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%\nimprovement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline\nevaluation method.",

In this study, we propose the Annotation Guidelines-based\nKnowledge Augmentation (AGKA) approach to improve LLMs. AGKA employs GPT 4.0 to\nretrieve label definition knowledge from annotation guidelines, and then\napplies the random under-sampler to select a few typical examples.\nSubsequently, we conduct a systematic evaluation benchmark of LEC, which\nincludes six LEC datasets covering behavior classification (question and\nurgency level), emotion classification (binary and epistemic emotion), and\ncognition classification (opinion and cognitive presence). The study results\ndemonstrate that AGKA can enhance non-fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT 4.0 and\nLlama 3 70B.

    "title": "Are Stereotypes Leading LLMs' Zero-Shot Stance Detection ?",
    "summary": "Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,\nleading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural\nLanguage Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment\nanalysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection\nmethods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves\nlabeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific\ntarget and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to\npolitical leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language\nModels when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We\nautomatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two\nattributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text\ncomplexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the\nmodel's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit\nsignificant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly\nassociating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American\ndialect with opposition to Donald Trump.",

    "summary": "Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet\nserving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is\nthe skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant\nlimitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different\nscales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which\nconstrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet\nhave focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations\nremain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale\nfeature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an\ninitial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By\nleveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive\nordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature\nfusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,\nmaking it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,\nKiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets\ndemonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and\nmaintained high performance.

To demonstrate, we conduct a\nscoping literature review with a curated selection of 100 unclassified studies\non AI in wargames, and construct a novel ontology of open-endedness using the\ncreativity afforded to players, adjudicators, and the novelty provided to\nobservers. Drawing from this body of work, we distill a set of practical\nrecommendations and critical safety considerations for deploying AI in\nopen-ended wargames across common domains.

To resolve these limitations, we propose a new fair\nclustering algorithm based on a novel decomposition of the fair $K$-means\nclustering objective function. The proposed algorithm, called Fair Clustering\nvia Alignment (FCA), operates by alternately (i) finding a joint probability\ndistribution to align the data from different protected groups, and (ii)\noptimizing cluster centers in the aligned space. A key advantage of FCA is that\nit theoretically guarantees approximately optimal clustering utility for any\ngiven fairness level without complex constraints, thereby enabling high-utility\nfair clustering in practice. Experiments show that FCA outperforms existing\nmethods by (i) attaining a superior trade-off between fairness level and\nclustering utility, and (ii) achieving near-perfect fairness without numerical\ninstability.",

    "summary": "Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been\nsuccessfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the\nperformance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous\nradar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due\nto data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery\nin new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking\n(CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient\nacquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning\nmodel (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the\nradar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of\ncardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to\nfine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results\nreveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and\nthe RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using\na small number of radar-ECG pairs for training.

In\nthis work, we introduce a new, training-free defense paradigm, Self-Activating\nInternal Defense (SAID), which reframes the defense task from external\ncorrection to internal capability activation. SAID uniquely leverages the LLM's\nown reasoning abilities to proactively identify and neutralize malicious intent\nthrough a three-stage pipeline: model-native intent distillation to extract\ncore semantics, optimal safety prefix probing to activate latent safety\nawareness, and a conservative aggregation strategy to ensure robust\ndecision-making. Extensive experiments on five open-source LLMs against six\nadvanced jailbreak attacks demonstrate that SAID substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art defenses in reducing harmful outputs. Crucially, it achieves\nthis while preserving model performance on benign tasks and incurring minimal\ncomputational overhead.

    "summary": "Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them\nmid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints.\nToday's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text,\nbut is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work\non closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make\n'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We\ntherefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is\nopen-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce\nvalid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.\nFirst-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean\n$\\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\\approx$ 1).\nCrucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of\nconstraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production\nof a valid item rather than error detection and principled,\nconstraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection\ndeteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning'\nshow no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks\nfunctional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans\nrespect constraints even on a first pass.

To answer this\nquestion, we introduce AssistedDS (Assisted Data Science), a benchmark designed\nto systematically evaluate how LLMs handle domain knowledge in tabular\nprediction tasks. AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly\nknown generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each\naccompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents. These\ndocuments provide domain-specific insights into data cleaning, feature\nengineering, and model selection. We assess state-of-the-art LLMs on their\nability to discern and apply beneficial versus harmful domain knowledge,\nevaluating submission validity, information recall, and predictive performance.\nOur results demonstrate three key findings: (1) LLMs frequently exhibit an\nuncritical adoption of provided information, significantly impairing their\npredictive performance when adversarial content is introduced, (2) helpful\nguidance is often insufficient to counteract the negative influence of\nadversarial information, and (3) in Kaggle datasets, LLMs often make errors in\nhandling time-series data, applying consistent feature engineering across\ndifferent folds, and interpreting categorical variables correctly.

    "summary": "Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling\nintricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent\nadvances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures\nbased on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static\ndecomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion\nmechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To\nexplicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel\nDynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch\nDecomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale\nRouting MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in\ncomponent to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with\nexponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints\nthrough input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,\ninter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed\nrepresentations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a\nmulti-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained\nrepresentations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature\nextraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically\nfuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local\nexperts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for\nTSF tasks.

    "summary": "Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and\nextensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large\nlanguage models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they\noften suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER\n(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline\nthat achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically\ncombining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and\nselective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both\nembedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual\nmentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a\nlow-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted\nLLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms\nReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,\nand performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all\nmentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM\ntokens.",

    "summary": "Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational\nefficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows\nrapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally\nimportant for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to\nselectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention\nheads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression\nmethod, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability\nestimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual\nheads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both\nretrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse\nbenchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct,\nMistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our\nhead-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines,\nparticularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128).

    "summary": "We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our\nmain contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions\nof the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic\nsystem of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit\ncharacterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a\nfunction space. This framework provides a transparent description of local\nbifurcations, characterizing their periodicity, and resonance structures, while\naccommodating singular potentials. We derive analytic expressions that\ncharacterize the emergence, form and shape (supercritical, critical,\nsubcritical or transcritical) of bifurcations involving possibly multiple\nFourier modes and connect them with discontinuous phase transitions. We also\ncharacterize, under suitable assumptions, the detailed structure of the\nstationary bifurcating solutions that are accurate upto an arbitrary number of\nFourier modes. At the global level, we establish regularity and concavity\nproperties of the free energy landscape, proving existence, compactness, and\ncoexistence of globally minimizing stationary measures, further identifying\ndiscontinuous phase transitions with points of non-differentiability of the\nminimum free energy map. As an application, we specialize the theory to the\nNoisy Mean-Field Transformer model, where we show how changing the inverse\ntemperature parameter $\\beta$ affects the geometry of the infinitely many\nbifurcations from the uniform measure. We also explain how increasing $\\beta$\ncan lead to a rich class of approximate multi-mode stationary solutions which\ncan be seen as `metastable states'. Further, a sharp transition from continuous\nto discontinuous (first-order) phase behavior is observed as $\\beta$ increases.",

    "summary": "Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,\nthere is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across\ndiverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic\nvariation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and\nmeasurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not\none fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework\nthat decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and\ndiversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,\ndivergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty\nevaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.\nWe evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on\nCreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different\nmetrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary\nand open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly\ncorrelated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different\ndomains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong\ncorrelations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -\nwhereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings\nsupport our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or\ndimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for\na holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.",

    "summary": "Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in\nhigh-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and\ntrust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification\nmethods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features\nfor achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in\nclassification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)\nmethods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution.

To bridge this gap, we present\nShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful\nshapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.\nAt the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,\nwhich effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for\nclassification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which\nreveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the\natomicity properties of shapelets.

    "summary": "This study presents a benchmarking analysis of the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100\nUltra (QAic) accelerator for large language model (LLM) inference, evaluating\nits energy efficiency (throughput per watt), performance, and hardware\nscalability against NVIDIA A100 GPUs (in 4x and 8x configurations) within the\nNational Research Platform (NRP) ecosystem. A total of 12 open-source LLMs,\nranging from 124 million to 70 billion parameters, are served using the vLLM\nframework. Our analysis reveals that QAic achieves competitive energy\nefficiency with advantages on specific models while enabling more granular\nhardware allocation: some 70B models operate on as few as 1 QAic card versus 8\nA100 GPUs required, with 20x lower power consumption (148W vs 2,983W). For\nsmaller models, single QAic devices achieve up to 35x lower power consumption\ncompared to our 4-GPU A100 configuration (36W vs 1,246W).

    "summary": "AI systems have the potential to produce both benefits and harms, but without\nrigorous and ongoing adversarial evaluation, AI actors will struggle to assess\nthe breadth and magnitude of the AI risk surface. Researchers from the field of\nsystems design have developed several effective sociotechnical AI evaluation\nand red teaming techniques targeting bias, hate speech, mis/disinformation, and\nother documented harm classes. However, as increasingly sophisticated AI\nsystems are released into high-stakes sectors (such as education, healthcare,\nand intelligence-gathering), our current evaluation and monitoring methods are\nproving less and less capable of delivering effective oversight.\n  In order to actually deliver responsible AI and to ensure AI's harms are\nfully understood and its security vulnerabilities mitigated, pioneering new\napproaches to close this \"responsibility gap\" are now more urgent than ever. In\nthis paper, we propose one such approach, the cooperative public AI red-teaming\nexercise, and discuss early results of its prior pilot implementations. This\napproach is intertwined with CAMLIS itself: the first in-person public\ndemonstrator exercise was held in conjunction with CAMLIS 2024. We review the\noperational design and results of this exercise, the prior National Institute\nof Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Assessing the Risks and Impacts of AI\n(ARIA) pilot exercise, and another similar exercise conducted with the\nSingapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). Ultimately, we argue\nthat this approach is both capable of delivering meaningful results and is also\nscalable to many AI developing jurisdictions.",

The core challenge is the diversity of\nrelational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and\nfunctional dependencies.

    "summary": "Adversarial examples reveal critical vulnerabilities in deep neural networks\nby exploiting their sensitivity to imperceptible input perturbations. While\nadversarial training remains the predominant defense strategy, it often incurs\nsignificant computational cost and may compromise clean-data accuracy. In this\nwork, we investigate an architectural approach to adversarial robustness by\nembedding group-equivariant convolutions-specifically, rotation- and\nscale-equivariant layers-into standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nThese layers encode symmetry priors that align model behavior with structured\ntransformations in the input space, promoting smoother decision boundaries and\ngreater resilience to adversarial attacks. We propose and evaluate two\nsymmetry-aware architectures: a parallel design that processes standard and\nequivariant features independently before fusion, and a cascaded design that\napplies equivariant operations sequentially. Theoretically, we demonstrate that\nsuch models reduce hypothesis space complexity, regularize gradients, and yield\ntighter certified robustness bounds under the CLEVER (Cross Lipschitz Extreme\nValue for nEtwork Robustness) framework. Empirically, our models consistently\nimprove adversarial robustness and generalization across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,\nand CIFAR-10C under both FGSM and PGD attacks, without requiring adversarial\ntraining.

    "summary": "Modern image restoration and super-resolution methods utilize deep learning\ndue to its superior performance compared to traditional algorithms. However,\ndeep learning typically requires large training datasets, which are rarely\navailable in astrophotography. Deep Image Prior (DIP) bypasses this constraint\nby performing blind training on a single image. Although effective in some\ncases, DIP often suffers from overfitting, artifact generation, and\ninstability. To overcome these issues and improve general performance, this\nwork proposes DIPLI - a framework that shifts from single-frame to multi-frame\ntraining using the Back Projection technique, combined with optical flow\nestimation via the TVNet model, and replaces deterministic predictions with\nunbiased Monte Carlo estimation obtained through Langevin dynamics. A\ncomprehensive evaluation compares the method against Lucky Imaging, a classical\ncomputer vision technique still widely used in astronomical image\nreconstruction, DIP, the transformer-based model RVRT, and the diffusion-based\nmodel DiffIR2VR-Zero. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate consistent\nimprovements, with the method outperforming baselines for SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS,\nand DISTS metrics in the majority of cases. In addition to superior\nreconstruction quality, the model also requires far fewer input images than\nLucky Imaging and is less prone to overfitting or artifact generation.\nEvaluation on real-world astronomical data, where domain shifts typically\nhinder generalization, shows that the method maintains high reconstruction\nquality, confirming practical robustness.",

    "summary": "Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are an integral part of large language models,\nyet their dense representations render them difficult to understand, edit, and\nsteer. Recent methods learn interpretable approximations via neuron-level\nsparsity, yet fail to faithfully reconstruct the original\nmapping--significantly increasing model's next-token cross-entropy loss. In\nthis paper, we advocate for moving to layer-level sparsity to overcome the\naccuracy trade-off in sparse layer approximation. Under this paradigm, we\nintroduce Mixture of Decoders (MxDs). MxDs generalize MLPs and Gated Linear\nUnits, expanding pre-trained dense layers into tens of thousands of specialized\nsublayers. Through a flexible form of tensor factorization, each sparsely\nactivating MxD sublayer implements a linear transformation with full-rank\nweights--preserving the original decoders' expressive capacity even under heavy\nsparsity. Experimentally, we show that MxDs significantly outperform\nstate-of-the-art methods (e.g., Transcoders) on the sparsity-accuracy frontier\nin language models with up to 3B parameters. Further evaluations on sparse\nprobing and feature steering demonstrate that MxDs learn similarly specialized\nfeatures of natural language--opening up a promising new avenue for designing\ninterpretable yet faithful decompositions.

    "title": "A Principle of Targeted Intervention for Multi-Agent Reinforcement\n  Learning",
    "summary": "Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards\ndesired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a\nhuman on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On\nthe other hand, designing external mechanisms (e.g., intrinsic rewards and\nhuman feedback) to coordinate agents mostly relies on empirical studies,\nlacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent\ninfluence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above\nissues. First, we introduce the concept of MARL interaction paradigms, using\nMAIDs to analyze and visualize both unguided self-organization and global\nguidance mechanisms in MARL. Then, we design a new MARL interaction paradigm,\nreferred to as the targeted intervention paradigm that is applied to only a\nsingle targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In\nour implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique, referred to as\nPre-Strategy Intervention (PSI), to realize the targeted intervention paradigm.\nSince MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite\ndesired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired\noutcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through\nthe PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a\ntool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design\nof an MARL interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of\nrelevance graph analysis.",

    "summary": "Social choice theory offers a wealth of approaches for selecting a candidate\non behalf of voters based on their reported preference rankings over options.\nWhen voters have underlying utilities for these options, however, using\npreference rankings may lead to suboptimal outcomes vis-\\`a-vis utilitarian\nsocial welfare. Distortion is a measure of this suboptimality, and provides a\nworst-case approach for developing and analyzing voting rules when utilities\nhave minimal structure. However in many settings, such as common paradigms for\nvalue alignment, alternatives admit a vector representation, and it is natural\nto suppose that utilities are parametric functions thereof. We undertake the\nfirst study of distortion for linear utility functions. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the distortion of linear social choice for deterministic and\nrandomized voting rules. We obtain bounds that depend only on the dimension of\nthe candidate embedding, and are independent of the numbers of candidates or\nvoters. Additionally, we introduce poly-time instance-optimal algorithms for\nminimizing distortion given a collection of candidates and votes. We\nempirically evaluate these in two real-world domains: recommendation systems\nusing collaborative filtering embeddings, and opinion surveys utilizing\nlanguage model embeddings, benchmarking several standard rules against our\ninstance-optimal algorithms.",

    "summary": "The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,\nmoderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a\nfragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance\non limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,\nhigh-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined\nto early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,\ninsufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,\nthis paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models\nfor Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data\ncuration. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,\nemphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology\nto create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized\nlegal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and\nsystematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not\npreviously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.\nFurthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models\ntailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks\ndemonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models\nsignificantly outperform existing baselines.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,\nyet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as\nwriting, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional\nalignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also\nmaximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:\nmodels may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer\nconcise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where\nindividually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The\nfundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism\nthat mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic\nAlignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic\ndecision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model\nexplicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs\npayoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself\nand the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During\ntraining, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative\nresponses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In\naddition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic\nreasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM\nservice change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially\nimproves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to\nbaselines across diverse tasks.

    "summary": "A full understanding of the behavior of a large language model (LLM) requires\nour grasp of its input token space. If this space differs from our assumptions,\nour comprehension of and conclusions about the LLM will likely be flawed. We\nelucidate the structure of the token embeddings both empirically and\ntheoretically. We present a novel statistical test assuming that the\nneighborhood around each token has a relatively flat and smooth structure as\nthe null hypothesis. Failing to reject the null is uninformative, but rejecting\nit at a specific token $\\psi$ implies an irregularity in the token subspace in\na $\\psi$-neighborhood, $B(\\psi)$. The structure assumed in the null is a\ngeneralization of a manifold with boundary called a \\emph{smooth fiber bundle}\n(which can be split into two spatial regimes -- small and large radius), so we\ndenote our new hypothesis test as the ``fiber bundle hypothesis.'' By running\nour test over several open-source LLMs, each with unique token embeddings, we\nfind that the null is frequently rejected, and so the evidence suggests that\nthe token subspace is not a fiber bundle and hence also not a manifold. As a\nconsequence of our findings, when an LLM is presented with two semantically\nequivalent prompts, if one prompt contains a token implicated by our test, the\nresponse to that prompt will likely exhibit less stability than the other.",

This paper\nintroduces FAIGMOE (Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI\nin Midsize Organizations and Enterprises), a conceptual framework addressing\nthe unique needs of both organizational types. FAIGMOE synthesizes technology\nadoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion\nperspectives into four interconnected phases: Strategic Assessment, Planning\nand Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and\nOperationalization and Optimization.

The framework incorporates GenAI specific considerations including\nprompt engineering, model orchestration, and hallucination management that\ndistinguish it from generic technology adoption frameworks.

    "summary": "Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their\nreliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as\nhallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural\nlanguage understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide\ninterpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,\nand syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational\nrepresentations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well\nas incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be\nmore limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation\nand linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid\napproach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with\nthe symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational\nrepresentations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for\nrephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source\nof information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic\nNLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for\nincremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and\ninterpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along\nwith symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines.

While KPIs have enabled automation gains\nunder TM Forum Levels 1--3, they remain numerical abstractions that act only as\nproxies for the real essence of communication networks: seamless connectivity,\nfairness, adaptability, and resilience. True autonomy requires perceiving and\nreasoning over the network environment as it is. Such progress can be achieved\nthrough \\emph{agentic AI}, where large language model (LLM)-powered agents\nperceive multimodal telemetry, reason with memory, negotiate across domains,\nand act via APIs to achieve multi-objective goals. However, deploying such\nagents introduces the challenge of cognitive biases inherited from human\ndesign, which can distort reasoning, negotiation, tool use, and actuation.\nBetween neuroscience and AI, this paper provides a tutorial on a selection of\nwell-known biases, including their taxonomy, definition, mathematical\nformulation, emergence in telecom systems and the commonly impacted agentic\ncomponents. The tutorial also presents various mitigation strategies tailored\nto each type of bias. The article finally provides two practical use-cases,\nwhich tackle the emergence, impact and mitigation gain of some famous biases in\n6G inter-slice and cross-domain management. In particular, anchor\nrandomization, temporal decay and inflection bonus techniques are introduced to\nspecifically address anchoring, temporal and confirmation biases. This avoids\nthat agents stick to the initial high resource allocation proposal or decisions\nthat are recent and/or confirming a prior hypothesis. By grounding decisions in\na richer and fairer set of past experiences, the quality and bravery of the\nagentic agreements in the second use-case, for instance, are leading to $\\times\n5$ lower latency and around $40\\%$ higher energy saving.",

    "title": "A new wave of vehicle insurance fraud fueled by generative AI",
    "summary": "Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify\naccident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive\nand costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each\nyear. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally\ninvolved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of\ngenerative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced\nnew methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly\nrealistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents\nwith minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.\nInsurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake\ndetection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate\nthese AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant\nlimitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and\nsophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated\nchecks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection\ntechnology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that\ncombating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this\nwhite paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing\na major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave\nof fraud.",

    "summary": "Intent classification models have made a significant progress in recent\nyears. However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource language\ndatasets, which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions\nwith high rates of illiteracy, where languages are more spoken than read or\nwritten. This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by\naround 90\\% of the population, while the national illiteracy rate remains at of\n42\\%. Wolof is actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African\nregion. To address these limitations, we introduce the Wolof Banking Speech\nIntent Classification Dataset (WolBanking77), for academic research in intent\nclassification. WolBanking77 currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the\nbanking domain and more than 4 hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on\nvarious baselines are conducted in this work, including text and voice\nstate-of-the-art models. The results are very promising on this current\ndataset. In addition, this paper presents an in-depth examination of the\ndataset's contents. We report baseline F1-scores and word error rates metrics\nrespectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77 dataset and also\ncomparisons between models.

    "summary": "Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,\nhealthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as\nheterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph\nneural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring\nseparate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders\nscalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for\nLatent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature\nencoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared\nmodality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal\nattributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that\naggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node\nrepresentation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,\nwhere it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while\nreducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and\nenables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way\ntoward foundation models for relational graph data.",

A\npotential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most\ngradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,\nwe overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased\ngradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating\ndirectional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully\ndesigned distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while\nmaintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive\noptimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific\nconstructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves\noptimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives.

    "summary": "In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly\ntrained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.\nHowever, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own\ntransactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This\nmismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade\nperformance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model\nmisspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of\nuncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture\nthe directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a\nnovel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and\nexplicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,\nenabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on\nsingle-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves\nsuperior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,\noffering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.",

    "summary": "How do language models (LMs) represent characters' beliefs, especially when\nthose beliefs may differ from reality? This question lies at the heart of\nunderstanding the Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities of LMs. We analyze LMs'\nability to reason about characters' beliefs using causal mediation and\nabstraction. We construct a dataset, CausalToM, consisting of simple stories\nwhere two characters independently change the state of two objects, potentially\nunaware of each other's actions. Our investigation uncovers a pervasive\nalgorithmic pattern that we call a lookback mechanism, which enables the LM to\nrecall important information when it becomes necessary. The LM binds each\ncharacter-object-state triple together by co-locating their reference\ninformation, represented as Ordering IDs (OIs), in low-rank subspaces of the\nstate token's residual stream. When asked about a character's beliefs regarding\nthe state of an object, the binding lookback retrieves the correct state OI and\nthen the answer lookback retrieves the corresponding state token. When we\nintroduce text specifying that one character is (not) visible to the other, we\nfind that the LM first generates a visibility ID encoding the relation between\nthe observing and the observed character OIs. In a visibility lookback, this ID\nis used to retrieve information about the observed character and update the\nobserving character's beliefs. Our work provides insights into belief tracking\nmechanisms, taking a step toward reverse-engineering ToM reasoning in LMs.",

While prior work has explored\nbackdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,\nconditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely\nunexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting\nlatent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages\ntextual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that\ninduce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,\nwhile preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on\nfour benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the\neffectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can\nachieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,\nwith negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies\nfurther reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training\nrather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in\nlatent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious\nrisks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need\nfor robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.",

Moreover, there is no formal and executable\nspecification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit\nand causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a\nunified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from\nnatural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet\nexpressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each\ninstruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields\nand semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects\nwith normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution,\nwhile adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real\nmemory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are\nintegrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution\ncontract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across\nheterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark\nthat separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic\nevaluation.

We propose Blockwise SFT, which\npartitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step\nfor stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future\nones.

Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show\nconsistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets.

While MBR has proven effective in machine\ntranslation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is\nnaturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as\ndialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,\napplying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in\nselecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's\ndistribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of\ngenerations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we\nintroduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to\nmake MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test\nour hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of\nlatent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a\nsentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate\nthe structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common\nsimilarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,\nour proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,\nwe evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,\nAlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity\nimproves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.",

To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,\nwe introduce \\textsc{\\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural\nlanguage understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering\nsyntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic\nacceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,\nsentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition\nto the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:\na Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models\nobtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a\nmonolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that\nCantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform\nbetter on syntactic tasks.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of\nenriching item descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendation\nsystems. However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting\nor employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the\ncomplementary information available from both textual and visual modalities.\nThis paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed\nX-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and\nconflicting information between text and images. By capturing nuanced insights\nfrom both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and\ncontextually rich item representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two\nwidely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing\nprompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. Furthermore, we\nidentify a U-shaped relationship between text-image dissimilarity and\nrecommendation performance, suggesting the benefit of applying multimodal\nprompting selectively. To support efficient real-time inference, we also\nintroduce X-Reflect-keyword, a lightweight variant that summarizes image\ncontent using keywords and replaces the base model with a smaller backbone,\nachieving nearly 50% reduction in input length while maintaining competitive\nperformance. This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal\ninformation and presents an effective solution for improving item understanding\nin multimodal recommendation systems.",

To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M,\ncomprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse\nbiological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on\nTreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training\nobjective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various\nbiological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We\nidentify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At\nthe inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns\nclosely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and\nhabitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the\nintra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better\nseparated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide\nformal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and\ncontrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties.

Although numerous detoxification methods\nexist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be\ncircumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse\nautoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual\nstream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the\ncorresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering\naggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing\ntrade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger\nsteering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in\nreducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2\nSmall depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores\nupon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general\nabilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs\nhampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled\nfeature learning.

To alleviate this issue, we introduce a\nnovel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding\nstrategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated\ntexts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods\nsolely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the\ncontributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination\nmitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual\ninformation. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that\ndynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining\nmaximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image\ntokens most pertinent to the generated response.

    "summary": "Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for\ncreating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be\nvisualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent\ntrade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,\nbecause the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs\ntend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual\nneeds. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often\naddress this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the\nfull spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's\nrequest reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's\ncentral tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,\ntraining-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead\nof forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific\npreference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related\npreferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response\nthat best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical\nframework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to\na strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive\nexperiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)\ndemonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,\nachieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from\nunder-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work\npresents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the\nreliability of preference-aligned models.",

While\nhigh-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant\nlow-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information\nloss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality\ndata effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.\nTo address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:\ndistilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and\ncoherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive\ndata construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing\nlow-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their\nhigh-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing\nsupervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement\nlearning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,\nsemantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments\nimperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for\nonly about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training\nbut also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods\nacross multiple benchmarks.

    "summary": "Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference\nin large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models\n(VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest\nspeedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal\ncapabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large\nVLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without\ncompromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do\nso. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a\nnovel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor\nmodule to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is\nseamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while\npreserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a\nglobal feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text\ntokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the\nscarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a\nspecialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating\nextended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training\nstrategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the\ntarget model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning\nwhen training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate\nViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM\nspeculative decoding. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/KangJialiang/ViSpec.",

Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)\nperform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an\nadapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)\nfine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for\nsentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi\n(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our\nresults show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and\nCPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2\npoints over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more\neffectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with\nlarger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged\ncheckpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.\nWe further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on\nEn-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than\nmonolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs\n0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more\nreliable substrate for low-resource pairs.

    "summary": "Current RAG retrievers are designed primarily for human readers, emphasizing\ncomplete, readable, and coherent paragraphs. However, LLMs benefit more from\nprecise, compact, and well-structured input, which enhances reasoning quality\nand efficiency. Existing methods often rely on reranking or summarization to\nidentify key sentences, but may suffer from semantic breaks and unfaithfulness.\nThus, efficiently extracting and organizing answer-relevant clues from\nlarge-scale documents while reducing LLM reasoning costs remains a challenge\nfor RAG. Inspired by Occam's razor, we frame LLM-centric retrieval as a MinMax\noptimization: maximizing the extraction of potential clues and reranking them\nfor well-organization, while minimizing reasoning costs by truncating to the\nsmallest sufficient clues set. In this paper, we propose CompSelect, a Compact\nclue Selection mechanism for LLM-centric RAG, consisting of a clue extractor, a\nreranker, and a truncator. (1) The clue extractor first uses answer-containing\nsentences as fine-tuning targets, aiming to extract sufficient potential clues;\n(2) The reranker is trained to prioritize effective clues based on real LLM\nfeedback; (3) The truncator uses the truncated text containing the minimum\nsufficient clues for answering the question as fine-tuning targets, thereby\nenabling efficient RAG reasoning. Experiments on three QA datasets show that\nCompSelect improves QA performance by approximately 11\\% and reduces Total\nLatency and Online Latency by approximately 17\\% and 67\\% compared to various\nbaseline methods on both LLaMA3 and Qwen3. Further analysis confirms its\nrobustness to unreliable retrieval and generalization across different\nscenarios, offering a scalable and cost-efficient solution for web-scale RAG\napplications.",

    "summary": "Transformers have theoretical limitations in modeling certain\nsequence-to-sequence tasks, yet it remains largely unclear if these limitations\nplay a role in large-scale pretrained LLMs, or whether LLMs might effectively\novercome these constraints in practice due to the scale of both the models\nthemselves and their pretraining data. We explore how these architectural\nconstraints manifest after pretraining, by studying a family of\n$\\textit{retrieval}$ and $\\textit{copying}$ tasks inspired by Liu et al.\n[2024a]. We use a recently proposed framework for studying length\ngeneralization [Huang et al., 2025] to provide guarantees for each of our\nsettings. Empirically, we observe an $\\textit{induction-versus-anti-induction}$\nasymmetry, where pretrained models are better at retrieving tokens to the right\n(induction) rather than the left (anti-induction) of a query token. This\nasymmetry disappears upon targeted fine-tuning if length-generalization is\nguaranteed by theory. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this asymmetry is\nconnected to the differences in the strength of induction versus anti-induction\ncircuits within pretrained transformers. We validate our findings through\npractical experiments on real-world tasks demonstrating reliability risks. Our\nresults highlight that pretraining selectively enhances certain transformer\ncapabilities, but does not overcome fundamental length-generalization limits.",

Such behavior undermines both\nthe validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding\nassistant deployments.\n  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,\na benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to\nexploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates \"impossible\" variants of tasks from\nexisting benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct\nconflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We\nmeasure an agent's \"cheating rate\" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,\nwhere any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.\n  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a\nversatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,\nrevealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test\nmodification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing\nhow prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)\ndeveloping monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive\nsolutions.

To address these challenges, we introduce a\nsegmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally\nproduces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual\ntokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the\nsegmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM.

    "summary": "MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative\nmodeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In\nthis work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two\nparts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient\nanalysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing\noptimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we\nintroduce $\\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory\nflow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting\na curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to\nMeanFlow, $\\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves\nbetter convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K\n256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms\nMeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model\nachieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID\nscores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).",

    "summary": "Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and\ndetail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly\ndue to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of\nimage tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation\n(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion\ntransformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training\ndata, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral\nprogression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures\nconverge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.\nSpecifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each\ndiffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the\ngenerative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions\nthat exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using\nFLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and\nachieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,\nwith gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions.

    "summary": "Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for\nunderstanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.\nHowever, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or\nhumans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,\nremain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for\ndeep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a\nbiologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most\nexciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and\nadversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nreconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual\ncortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded\nneurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers\nof the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can\nreconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500\nneurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified\nbenchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research.

Traditional CNN have been able to\nidentify bogus media, but they struggle to perform well on different datasets\nand are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their lack of robustness.\nVision transformers have demonstrated potential in the realm of image\nclassification problems, but they require enough training data. Motivated by\nthese limitations, this publication introduces Tex-ViT (Texture-Vision\nTransformer), which enhances CNN features by combining ResNet with a vision\ntransformer. The model combines traditional ResNet features with a texture\nmodule that operates in parallel on sections of ResNet before each\ndown-sampling operation. The texture module then serves as an input to the dual\nbranch of the cross-attention vision transformer. It specifically focuses on\nimproving the global texture module, which extracts feature map correlation.\nEmpirical analysis reveals that fake images exhibit smooth textures that do not\nremain consistent over long distances in manipulations. Experiments were\nperformed on different categories of FF++, such as DF, f2f, FS, and NT,\ntogether with other types of GAN datasets in cross-domain scenarios.\nFurthermore, experiments also conducted on FF++, DFDCPreview, and Celeb-DF\ndataset underwent several post-processing situations, such as blurring,\ncompression, and noise.

To\nefficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR\ndata is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their\nangular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable\nefficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental\ngeometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,\ncompromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR\nIntrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,\nsensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from\nspinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or\ncalibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic\ngeometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters\nincluding laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam\ncalibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud\nreconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the\ncomplete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect\npoint preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds.

Our comparison against\nmultiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies\ndramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and\nthe variability in visual content that defines \"normal\" scenes.

    "title": "Efficient Multi-bit Quantization Network Training via Weight Bias\n  Correction and Bit-wise Coreset Sampling",
    "summary": "Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural\nnetworks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.\nHowever, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as\nfull-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a\ncost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra\nfine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate\nprecision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address\nthis issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead\nwithout compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared\nbatch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing\nquantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation\ndistributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child\nmodel to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based\nimportance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.\nExperiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and\nViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior\naccuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x.

However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale\nhigh-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training\nstrategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the\nfirst challenge, we introduce \\textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of\n100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual\nfidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on\ndetail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the\nsecond challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that\nenhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we\ndesign (i) \\textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning\non detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \\textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency\nRegularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to\nsoftly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail\npreservation.

    "summary": "Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been\nfueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text\nreports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has\nenabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned\n3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,\nlong-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders\nthat are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs\nfine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce\nBTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder\nthat unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,\nfrequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables\n(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)\nlong-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice\nexcerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional\nmemory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it\nimproves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and\nMerlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared\nto GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically\nconsistent 512*512*241 volumes.

    "summary": "Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and\ntemporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)\ncan process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long\nsequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or\ninconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most\ninformative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal\ndependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide\ncomplete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus\nEvidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video\nunderstanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two\nkey components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module\nselects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM\nreasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns\nembeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus\nRefinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and\nvisual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.\nExtensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and\nrobustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection\nfor Video-LLMs.",

While\ndeep learning has advanced image segmentation, performance often degrades in\nthese adverse scenarios. Additional challenges include the difficulty of\nobtaining accurate annotations and managing severe class imbalance. We proposed\na novel noise-adaptive attention mechanism, extending the\nSqueeze-and-Excitation (SE) module, to dynamically adjust to varying noise\nlevels. This Adaptive SE (ASE) mechanism is integrated into a U-Net decoder,\nwith residual encoder blocks, forming a lightweight yet powerful model:\nASE_Res_U-Net. We also developed a synthetic-dataset strategy and employed\ntailored loss functions and evaluation metrics to mitigate class imbalance and\nensure fair assessment. ASE_Res_U-Net effectively segmented microtubules in\nboth synthetic and real noisy images, outperforming its ablated variants and\nstate-of-the-art curvilinear-structure segmentation methods. It achieved this\nwhile using fewer parameters, making it suitable for resource-constrained\nenvironments.

To integrate volumetric guidance\ninto intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method\nfor deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D\ndeformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the\nbiological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion.\nUnlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail\noutright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces\nanatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise-rigid nature of human\nmovement.

To overcome these\nchallenges, we reformulate the problem and eliminate the network's nested\nstructure. By relating this reformulation to epigraphical projections of the\nactivation functions, we transform the problem into a convex optimization\nproblem that can be efficiently solved using a primal-dual algorithm. We also\nprove that this reformulation is equivalent to the original variational\nproblem. Through experiments on several imaging tasks, we show that the\nproposed approach not only outperforms subgradient methods and even accelerated\nmethods in the smooth setting, but also facilitates the training of the\nregularizer itself.",

Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can\nbe seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines.

There are\ntwo major challenges for learning dense hand contact estimation. First, there\nexists class imbalance issue from hand contact datasets where majority of\nregions are not in contact.

To resolve the class imbalance issue,\nwe introduce balanced contact sampling, which builds and samples from multiple\nsampling groups that fairly represent diverse contact statistics for both\ncontact and non-contact vertices.

However,\npersonalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge\ndue to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept\ndistributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation\nframework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).\nOur approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step\ndiffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained\nsimultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the\nstudent, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the\nEchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure\nconsistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is\noptimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and\nwith alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.\nFurthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,\nwherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to\nfeedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation\nmechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts\nbut also improves the generative quality of the teacher model.

However, the validity of fairness auditing\nhinges on the reliability of the DAI process.

We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,\nfairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via\nintra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any\ndemographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and\nethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results\nshow that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on\nethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute.

We\nfurther demonstrate that using the falling edge of the signal leads to more\naccurate period estimates than the rising edge, and that for certain signals\ninterpolating the zero-level crossings can further increase accuracy. Our\nexperiments find that the outstanding capabilities of the camera in detecting\nfrequencies up to 64kHz for a single pixel do not carry over to full sensor\nimaging as readout bandwidth limitations become a serious obstacle.

Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation\nincludes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties\nin maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the\ngenerated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant\nexpression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human\nface occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly\nsensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored\nchallenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving\nReward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on\nreinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing\nauxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a\ndirect and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a\nface identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our\nmethod backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling\nchain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial\nscoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature\npools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A\nKL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and\nprevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V\nmodel and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nOur project and code are available at https://ipro-alimama.github.io/.",

These\npriors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and\ncontext-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies\ndemonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple\nbenchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling\ncomplex degradation dynamics.

    "title": "FairGen: Enhancing Fairness in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via\n  Self-Discovering Latent Directions",
    "summary": "While Diffusion Models (DM) exhibit remarkable performance across various\nimage generative tasks, they nonetheless reflect the inherent bias presented in\nthe training set. As DMs are now widely used in real-world applications, these\nbiases could perpetuate a distorted worldview and hinder opportunities for\nminority groups. Existing methods on debiasing DMs usually requires model\nretraining with a human-crafted reference dataset or additional classifiers,\nwhich suffer from two major limitations: (1) collecting reference datasets\ncauses expensive annotation cost; (2) the debiasing performance is heavily\nconstrained by the quality of the reference dataset or the additional\nclassifier. To address the above limitations, we propose FairGen, a\nplug-and-play method that learns attribute latent directions in a\nself-discovering manner, thus eliminating the reliance on such reference\ndataset. Specifically, FairGen consists of two parts: a set of attribute\nadapters and a distribution indicator. Each adapter in the set aims to learn an\nattribute latent direction, and is optimized via noise composition through a\nself-discovering process. Then, the distribution indicator is multiplied by the\nset of adapters to guide the generation process towards the prescribed\ndistribution. Our method enables debiasing multiple attributes in DMs\nsimultaneously, while remaining lightweight and easily integrable with other\nDMs, eliminating the need for retraining. Extensive experiments on debiasing\ngender, racial, and their intersectional biases show that our method\noutperforms previous SOTA by a large margin.",

    "summary": "Recent progress in text-video retrieval has been largely driven by\ncontrastive learning. However, existing methods often overlook the effect of\nthe modality gap, which causes anchor representations to undergo in-place\noptimization (i.e., optimization tension) that limits their alignment capacity.\nMoreover, noisy hard negatives further distort the semantics of anchors. To\naddress these issues, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that\nintroduces a learnable, pair-specific increment $\\Delta_{ij}$ between text\n$t_i$ and video $v_j$, redistributing gradients to relieve optimization tension\nand absorb noise. We derive $\\Delta_{ij}$ via a multivariate first-order Taylor\nexpansion of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, showing that it\nguides updates along locally consistent descent directions. A lightweight\nneural module conditioned on the semantic gap couples increments across batches\nfor structure-aware correction. Furthermore, we regularize $\\Delta$ through a\nvariational information bottleneck with relaxed compression, enhancing\nstability and semantic consistency. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate\nthat GARE consistently improves alignment accuracy and robustness, validating\nthe effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.

    "summary": "Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal\ndatasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) by\nenabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,\napplying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited\navailability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most\nexisting medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus\nprimarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and\nclinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel\nVietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset consisting of 2,757 whole-body\nPET/CT volumes from independent patients and their corresponding full-length\nclinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical\nAI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training\ncorpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional\nimaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages,\nparticularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive\nPET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to\nenhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test\nsets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs\non downstream tasks. The experimental results show that incorporating our\ndataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe\nthis dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the\ndevelopment of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, especially for\nlow-resource languages and clinical use in Vietnamese healthcare.

    "summary": "In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy\nlearning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these\napproaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene\nrepresentations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to\nachieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth\nexploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this\npaper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning\nmethod (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve\neffective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate\nfeatures from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric\nfeatures from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via\ncross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the\npolicy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms\nthe vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct\nperformance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation\ntasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0%\nand far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%,\noutperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further\nrobustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying\nconditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we\nopen-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate,\nthis library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as\nmixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP,\nDP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.",

    "summary": "A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained\nonce on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene\nretraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and\nrobustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of\nspectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel \"Rebellious Student\" framework\nfor complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student\nparadigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial\nbranch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary\nspatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning\nstrategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via\nreverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and\n(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized\nusing decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining\nreconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework\nenhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free\nand training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.\nExperiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements over several\nestablished baselines with modest computational overhead, confirming the\neffectiveness of the proposed complementary learning paradigm.

However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from\nshort or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This\nlimitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen\nprompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset\nfeaturing high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive\ntextual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,\naccompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per\ndescription (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips\npreserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,\nfacilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also\nimprove upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,\nMoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better\nexploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single\ngenerative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance\non both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks.

However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a\ncooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning\ncross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and\nrecipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually\napparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the\nrepresentations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting\nin difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of\ningredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is\nexpected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and\nrecipes sourced from different cuisines.

    "summary": "Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,\nparticularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models\nutilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence\nof ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,\ncross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the\nissue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur\nhigh computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially\nin the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D\npseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and\nMetric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D\npseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields\nsubstantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\\%, from 9.73\nto 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to\nearlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to\nother architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,\nachieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,\navoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our\nmethod enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on\nthe full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71\nmIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\\%. These findings highlight\nthe critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice\nof loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene\nunderstanding.",

They typically require\nextremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training\nto achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a\nkey source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip\nwith, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at\nmulti-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage\nhyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides\na principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and\ntextual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an\nefficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize\nvisual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary\ngranularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic\nspace. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\\\"{o}bius multiplication\noperations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling\nmatrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible\nyet efficient parametrization strategy.

Further, we\nshow commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal\nverifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the\noptimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these\ninsights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified\nalgorithm.

    "title": "Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from\n  Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses",
    "summary": "When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions\nsignificantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise\ncommonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these\nextrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry\npredictions from the model.\n  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering\nmethod. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate\ngradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic\norientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly\naddresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction\nsystems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate\noutside the original training viewpoints.\n  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves\nvisual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance\nField (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter\nseamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,\nunlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.\n  Code and results at https://damian-bowness.github.io/EV3DGS",
