    "summary": "Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,\nbut accurately capturing spatial relationships like \"above\" or \"to the right\nof\" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship\nfollowing with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to\nenhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.\nWe propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position\ncontrol into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via\nautomatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both\nspatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects\nwithin designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We\nfind that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate\nand cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully\ncomplete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for\nposition-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept\nof Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top\nmodels still have significant room for improvement in position-based\ngeneration. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances\nbase models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%\non PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on\nPosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while\nintegrating position control into leading models training-free.

    "summary": "A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to\nretarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning\n(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the\nsignificant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically\nimplausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,\ncommon retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment\ninteractions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To\naddress this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data\ngeneration engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and\npreserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the\nterrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation\nbetween the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,\nOmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,\npreserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from\na single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object\nconfigurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions\nfrom OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour\ntrajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact\npreservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables\nproprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30\nseconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained\nwith only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,\nwithout any learning curriculum.",

Unlike conventional metrics that yield single\nvalues, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a\nhierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through\nuser-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the\nscope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency\nand facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,\nagentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals.

    "summary": "3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a\ncanonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to\nmemorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such\nalignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust\ngeneralization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,\nSIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this\nprinciple, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,\nwhose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over\nsimilarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a\nde-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model\noutperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.\nIt also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,\nlowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\\ell1$\non OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol\nstill outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results\nestablish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable\nshape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.",

    "summary": "Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in\nrobotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One\npromising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it\nquantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task\ncompletion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward\nlearning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,\nincluding robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances\nbetween frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise\nproxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments\non ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically\nimproves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10\ntasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This\napproach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed\nenvironment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.\nMoreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human\nvideos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward\nsignals from diverse video sources.",

    "title": "Learning to See Before Seeing: Demystifying LLM Visual Priors from\n  Language Pre-training",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,\nsurprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual\ncapabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of\nmultimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having\nseen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior\nemerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more\nsensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In\nparallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its\nperformance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a\ndata-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T\ntoken scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled\nexperiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction\npipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal\nfine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and\nmixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we\npropose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level\nExistence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of\ndeliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the\nway for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.",

We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit\nproblem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a\ncost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its\ndifficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics\nwithin a fixed computational budget.

While these generated\ntest sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical\nflaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the\nbenchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English\ntranslation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs\nfor translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated\ntest data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),\nwith their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a\nbenchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the\nsource language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English\ntranslation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of\nEnglish translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text\nis one attribution to self bias.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but\ncontinue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack\nvectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable\nto fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive\ndemographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect\noutcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible\nyet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a\nstrategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text\ngeneration. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the\nretrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts\nfairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled\ndemographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis\nperformed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace\n(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),\neach integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic\nvariations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed\nanalysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with\nperturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the\nviolations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work\nreinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to\nprevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for\ndevelopers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs\nwithout compromising fairness or reliability.",

    "summary": "The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous\ndemand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While\nthese accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital\nand operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and\ncooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a\ncritical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter\nlifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep\npace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse\nhardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme\nacross three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how\ndesign choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term\nTCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,\nwe use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these\noptimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential\nrequires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle\nmanagement framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all\nthree stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system\naging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\\% over traditional approaches.\nUsing our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter\nlifecycle for the future.",

Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in\nthe literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting\nthat is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and\nmodalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage\nAdaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures\nbetween the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations\nwhen it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge\ndistillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising\npersonalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server\nmodel under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the\nnumber of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks\nsuffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a\nmultitude of baselines.

It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws:\nempirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at\nthe same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.\n  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during\ninference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using\nspiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses\nstrengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept\nwhile processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a\ngraph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution.

    "summary": "The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and\ncommercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial\nindoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to\nspectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents\ncan be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing,\nbetween commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where\nunlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor\nincumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no\nreliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or\noutdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor\naccess points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and\nreducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate\nindoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling\nautomatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To\nthis end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for\nI/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and\nhighly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and\ndistinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various\nmethodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning\napproaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse\ngeographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone\ncan achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi)\ndata, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of\nGNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy,\nshowcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.",

While most studies and global discussions focus\non generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or\nothers, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents\nare safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational\nsafety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user\nqueries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,\nan evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in\ngeneral and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model\nfamilies comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies\nacross models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the\nstrongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\\%\n-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in\nthe 62--73\\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\\%), and Gemma\nand Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\\% and 23.84\\%, respectively. While operational\nsafety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose\nprompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt\ngrounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground\nprovides consistent gains of up to 23\\%, while P-ground delivers even larger\nboosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\\%.

Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store\nconsumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the\nmost complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.\nThrough a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable\nflexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario\ntasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from\nmultiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and\nspatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous\ninstructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn\nconversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,\nenabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments\nand stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the\nmost advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and\nless than 50% success rate on others.

    "summary": "Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation\ntasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the\ngeneration-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative\nfunction to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the\nunderstanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal\nGenerative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions\nare often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting\nwith semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We\npropose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that\nexploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,\nour method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the\ntarget query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative\ntheory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while\nconcealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack\nstrategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to\nproduce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing\nand answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.\nSTaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,\nforcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the\nnarrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently\nsurpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and\nsurpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a\ncritical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety\nalignments in UMMs.",

    "summary": "A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological\norganisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making.",

In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions\ncorrespond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of\nonly the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively\ndiscovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that\neffectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains\nand models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute\ncontrollability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned\nbaselines.

    "summary": "Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their\ninherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to\nautoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise\nsemi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their\nnatural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.\nHowever, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional\nsemi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding\noverhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current\nblock is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where\nlow-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading\nto incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a\nstatistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we\nidentify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes\nlocal semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.\nLeveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,\nplug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic\nsteps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy\nimprovement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time\noptimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and\nconfidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.",

This dependence, which can manifest itself even as\nsimple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be\nindependently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this\noverlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A\ntoy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior\nlocal minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the\npresence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as\ncorrelations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our\ntheoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural\nnetworks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in\npractice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.",

    "summary": "With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for\nfine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation\n(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous\npotential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact\nupdates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they\noften introduce a \\emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur\n\\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and\neffectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{F}ederated\n\\textbf{Lo}w-\\textbf{R}ank \\textbf{A}ggregation with \\textbf{N}early\n\\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA\nmatrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\\hat{A}$ and\n$\\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This\nsurrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\\nabla\n\\Bar{W} = \\sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\\nabla \\hat{W} =\n\\hat{B}\\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By\ndoing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap\nbetween local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key\nlimitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive\nevaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,\nmathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation\nmodels. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves\nstate-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication\noverhead.",

    "summary": "Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising\nparadigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal\ndynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous\nspeaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational\nfluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework\nto systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans\nlearn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic\ninstruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such\nas tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM\narchitectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art\nmodels handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with\nfundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade\nsubstantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in\ntime awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a\nfoundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware\nconversational AI.

To\naddress this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation\n(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL).

    "title": "Interactive Learning for LLM Reasoning",
    "summary": "Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training\nenvironments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language\nModels (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).\nHowever, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final\nsolutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance\ntheir reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve\nquestions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent\ninteraction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce\nILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:\nDynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic\nInteraction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive\nstrategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then\nexchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea\nFusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,\nbefore deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR\nemploys Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while\nintegrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward\nfunction, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We\nvalidate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,\nevaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding\nbenchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms\nsingle-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest\nbaseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger\nLLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost\nmulti-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.",

    "summary": "Some traits making a \"good\" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For\nexample, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are\nsometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear\nobjective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to\nmeasure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot\nArena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer \"better\"\npersonality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model\nresponses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight\nlimitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was\nrolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed\noverfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,\nlimited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We\nintroduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality\nchanges, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited\nacross AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI\nannotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and\nbrowser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we\nanalyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets\nincluding Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to\nanalyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our\nFeedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in\npopular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation\ndata at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.",

In this paper,\nwe discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient\nutilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present\nPoint2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment\n(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent\nmanner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label\nassignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an\nenhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes\nthe shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and\nSAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the\nfirst model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it\ncreatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed\nalgorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense\nscenes.

    "summary": "The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is\nseverely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data\nheterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric\nforward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading\nworkload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions\nattempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or\ncommunication efficiency.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that\nfundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into\nfine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates\ncritical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile\nworkloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then\nharnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles\nbalanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the\nforward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a\nhigh-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all\nparallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves\nup to a $2.8\\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking\nthe conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high\nresource efficiency.",

    "summary": "Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important\nconcern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks\nbefore deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware\nthat they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous\ncapabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in\nsafety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or\nretrained. Such strategic deception - often known as \"sandbagging\" - threatens\nto undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of\nvalue to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns\nthat demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are\nconsistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of\nstrategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the\nrecently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that\nthis problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and\nconstruct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and\nincompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we\ninvestigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between\nsuch behaviours in bandit models.

Conventional approaches typically rely on\ndense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult\nto scale up.

Instead of\nrepresenting all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative\ninformation in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian\nprimitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under\nthe same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting\ndistillation performance.

    "summary": "In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high\nefficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with\nfinding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically\ndistributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot\nafter deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two\nalgorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired\nmetaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for\noptimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom\ndataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation\ntime, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing\nparameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires\nless input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable\nreal-time logistics systems.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a\ncrucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language\nModels (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning\ntasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor\nsample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \\textbf{DIVER}\n(\\textbf{D}iversity-\\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for\n\\textbf{V}ersatil\\textbf{E} \\textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that\nhighlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize\ndeep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical\nstudy to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and\nreasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity\nincentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically\nstructured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a\npotential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance\nand design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental\nresults show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various\nexploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in\nboth Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations.

This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating\ninterpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI\nalignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of \"thick\ndescription,\" we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect\ndeeper cultural meanings--what we term \"thick outputs\"-grounded firmly in\nuser-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for\nsuccessful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,\nthe capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural\ncontexts implied within prompts.

    "summary": "Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,\nincluding programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits\naccess to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to\nexplore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three\nprimary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code\nsnippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into\ngame engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and\nstate management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate\npotential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still\nremains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game\nprojects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.\n  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end\ncoordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of\nrunnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses\na Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints\nand engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces\nexecutable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific\ncomponent binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides\nreal-time error correction through conversational interaction.

Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight\nkey texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example\nlearning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,\nthe performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional\nmedicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the\nbaseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the\nweakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling\nand provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression\nscreening.",

    "summary": "Spatial reasoning is fundamental to auditory perception, yet current audio\nlarge language models (ALLMs) largely rely on unstructured binaural cues and\nsingle step inference. This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and\ndistance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work\nsuch as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on\ncoarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit\ngeometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the\n$\\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio\nencoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using\npanoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while\nrequiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present\n$\\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially\ngrounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and\ndistance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to\nmulti-step reasoning, $\\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA\nestimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and\nrelease $\\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining\nbinaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across\nboth in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new\n$\\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean\nDoA error by $\\textbf{11$^{\\circ}$}$ through $\\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves\nspatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\\textbf{25}$\\% over BAT.",

This paper\nintroduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as\na continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then\npropose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests\nunstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a\ncomprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline\nof specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where\nthe system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more\nsophisticated and targeted test cases.

While the single-pair variant -- finding the top-$k$ simple\nshortest paths between two specified vertices -- has been extensively studied\nover the past decades, with Yen's algorithm and its heuristic improvements\nemerging as the most effective solving strategies, relatively little attention\nhas been devoted to the more general single-source version, where the goal is\ndetermining top-$k$ simple shortest paths from a source vertex to all other\nvertices. Motivated by the numerous practical applications of ranked shortest\npaths, in this paper we provide new insights and algorithmic contributions to\nthis problem. In particular, we first present a theoretical characterization of\nthe structural properties of its solutions. Then, we introduce the first\npolynomial-time algorithm specifically designed to handle it.

On the other\nhand, through an extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and\nsynthetic graphs, we demonstrate that our algorithm consistently and\nsignificantly outperforms the latter baseline in terms of running time,\nachieving speed-ups of up to several orders of magnitude.

    "summary": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces\nsignificant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel\nmethods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy\nand complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal\nframework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular\n(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in\ncontrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering\n(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)\nanalysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature\nfusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This\nfeature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\narchitecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at\nlow SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).\nAdditionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous\nmulti-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%\nclassification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training\ntimes (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this\nframework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational\nefficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.\nThis work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG\nartifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion\nsurpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.",

    "summary": "The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains\nunclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative\nmemory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal\nthat the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output\n(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary\ncontributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently\nachieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,\nwhereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on\nembedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical\nanalyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the\nouter-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced\nand effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for\nheterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to\nexploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery\n(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint\noptimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing\narbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics\nand extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each\nheterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module\ntermed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse\ndistortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping\nregions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into\na novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres\ndynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,\nfused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art\nperformance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth\nnetworks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of\nheterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty\nand valuable empirical insights.",

    "summary": "Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric\nimages enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial\nsafety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently\nhindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on\ncostly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object\ninteraction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of\nthe actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about\nmanipulated objects (e.g., \"I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to\nthe pan\"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to\nacquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We\nintroduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel\ntask where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from\nnatural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference\ntime. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised\nIn-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model\ndistilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object\nassociations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at\ntest time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on\nopen-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the\nsuperiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that\nWISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of\nfully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise\nannotations.",

    "summary": "In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn\nincreasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted\nmisinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content\nproduced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although\nboth share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP\nresearch focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community\ntargets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often\nspecialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,\nhowever, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the\neffectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the\nOmnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive\nbenchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from\nexisting resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this\ndataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a\nframework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM\nbackbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to\ncapture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism\nthat provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive\nsignals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and\nconsistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming\nspecialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world\nmultimodal deception detection.",

Current\napproaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label\npairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose\nLLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's\nimbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm\ncritical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To\naddress these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm\nthat mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human\nengineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying\nrules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to\noptimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing\nhallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first\ncold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13\nstrategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning\ncapability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function.\nEmpirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing\nmethods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by\n228.05%).

As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the\ngeneralization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight\nspectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization\nin smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the\ndimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,\nwe propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed\nmajority vote classifier.

Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight\ncorrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs\ncontain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To\nefficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning\ntargets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as\nin-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.\nBy leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new\nunlearning requests without additional training.

Multi-layer nested JSON\nstructures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into\nsemantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into\nkey-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual\nrelationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.\nFor instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata\n(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information\n(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a\ntransformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and\noutputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas.

To address this challenge, we present StorInfer, a novel\nstorage-assisted LLM inference system that accelerates response time by\nprecomputing and storing predictable query-response pairs offline. When a user\nquery semantically matches a precomputed query, StorInfer bypasses expensive\nGPU inference and instantly returns the stored response, significantly reducing\nlatency and compute costs. To maximize coverage and effectiveness, StorInfer\nemploys an LLM-driven generator that adaptively produces diverse and\ndeduplicated queries based on a given knowledge base. This is achieved via two\ntechniques: adaptive query masking, which prevents regeneration of similar\nqueries, and adaptive sampling, which dynamically tunes generation parameters\nto promote semantic diversity. The resulting query-response pairs are embedded\nand indexed using a disk-backed vector database to enable fast,\nsimilarity-based retrieval at runtime. Using this approach, we generated 150K\nunique precomputed pairs (taking up to 830 MB of storage space), achieving up\nto 17.3% latency reduction with no loss in response quality. Our evaluation\nacross multiple QA datasets demonstrates the practicality and scalability of\nstorage-assisted inference, especially in scenarios with predictable query\ndistributions.

As\nlarge language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human\ndecision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is\nessential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in\ncontexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently\nambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to\nrecognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter\ndecision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a\nnovel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex\nsocial dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over\n13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying\ntheir associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)\nand situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different\nLLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual\ncues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are\npredominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles\nrather than situational information.

Current\ncode agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and\ntool sets.

Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of\ndata leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI\nand Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'\ncoding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks\nconfidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),\nwhich operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while\nretaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent.

DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation\nacross multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and\ntemporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a\nBernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus\nachieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce\nsparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency\nand supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods.\nCross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the\nrobustness and compatibility of our approach.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,\nwhere they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.\nHowever, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing\ncurrent methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This\nuniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently\nsucceed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients\nduring training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.\nViewing each task's exploration as an \"item\" with a distinct \"value\" and\n\"cost\", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This\nformulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively\ndistributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When\napplied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy\ngradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational \"free lunch\",\nour approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is\nsaturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly\nlarger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which\nwould be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These\nimprovements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points\non specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional\nhomogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.",

Building on these advances, recent research\nhas sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding\npromising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study\nuncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially\nenhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,\nit may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures\non otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute\nthis phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the\nmodel to increasingly disregard visual input.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle\nrefusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As\ntense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often\ncomply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed\nin current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.\nIn this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,\nmechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific\nvulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the\nspecific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the\ntense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector\nto recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it\ninto a \"preventative fine-tuning\", forcing the model to learn a more robust\nrefusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack\nsuccess rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and\nminimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and\nutility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the\npropagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.\nFurthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can\nbe leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for\nadjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable\nAI safety.",

    "summary": "Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style\nby manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as\ngender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration\nof advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and\ndiffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly\ntransitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based\ncontrol, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings\nfrom textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the\nunderlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full\npotential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to\nvisualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various\nmainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:\nembeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer\nclusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose\nHiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts\nstyle embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate\ncontrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.\nAdditionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the\ncomplementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory\npreferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual\nprompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when\napplied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style\ncontrollability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while\npreserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.\nAudio samples are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/HiStyle-2517/.",

We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in\nframework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than\nbranching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)\nevaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly\njudges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which\nclusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT\ninto three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of\nThoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.\nOur results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model\ninvocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible\naccuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields\nsubstantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14\nsettings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning\nsteps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator\nin BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence\nchecking.

    "summary": "Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully\nunlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective\nmid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable\nfast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by\npresenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes\npost-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the\nvalue approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent\nplanning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training\neffectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL\npolicy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which\nthat policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that\nmid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the\neffective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the\nspace of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these\ninsights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable\nmid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower\nbound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent\nstructures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.\nExperiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach.

    "title": "Better with Less: Small Proprietary Models Surpass Large Language Models\n  in Financial Transaction Understanding",
    "summary": "Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory\ncompliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of\nfinancial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract\nmeaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based\nmodels have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper\nseeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This\npaper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer\nmodels: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type,\nwe explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small\nproprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while\nLLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive\ncapabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not\nsignificantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of\nfinancial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in\nterms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique\nrequirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower\noperational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the\nfinancial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection\nbased on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of\ncustomized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized\napplications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only\nmodel to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage.\nThis model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than\n\\$13 million annual cost.",

    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge\nacross a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied\nreasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the\nembodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on\nimage annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes\nan event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)\nbenchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied\nreasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a\nhierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object\nlocalization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with\ndata collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including\nindoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive\nexperiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting\nfindings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while\nexcelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),\nunderperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;\nmodels such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where\nrequires grounding combined with visual trace planning.",

    "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating\nhigh-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion\nmodels have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image\nediting. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the\nsource image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.\nHowever, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the\ntarget text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while\nenabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility\nneeded for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map\nInversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for\noptimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We\nanalyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this\nanalysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with\nthe desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and\nedited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion\noutperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in\nboth preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts.

    "summary": "Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing\napproaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly\nconform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local\nautonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by\nfeature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering\noutcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with\nsignificant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce\nautonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns\nand accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior\nknowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic\nannealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally\npromotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to\nexploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase\ntransitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further\nenhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network\n(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between\nentities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates\nvariable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across\ndiverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely\naligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it\nachieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring\nautonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%).

When ad\nideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,\nemotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,\nshowing that models favor high-probability information.

    "summary": "While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on\nfactoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and\nuntruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their\nparametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --\nmodels must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid\nhallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:\napproaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those\nthat encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct\nanswers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we\npresent TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly\noptimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using\nGRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct\nanswers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce\nhallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling\nabstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive\nexperiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to\nvanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves\ntruthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models\n(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth\nablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as\nsupervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual\ncorrectness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven\nTruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,\nunderscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing\ntruthful LLMs.",

    "summary": "The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely\nunlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such\nimprovements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to\ndemonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of\nnovel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively\nsupport structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across\nQwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads\nevolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT\nfoster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group\nrelative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few\nattention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their\nsurvival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,\nwe find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking\nheads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less\nefficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,\nwe connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:\nstrengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for\ndifficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as\ncalculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect\ncircuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent\ntension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.\nMore broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,\nemphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning\nstrategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.",

    "summary": "The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,\nhigh-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,\ngenerating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming\nparticularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,\nwhere accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual\nunderstanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented\npipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in\nstructured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,\nbase generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using\ndocuments retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data\nquality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality\nsamples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario\nfocused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline\ngenerates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human\nintervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and\nreinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing\ndependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.",

    "summary": "Recently, sophisticated deep learning-based approaches have been developed\nfor generating efficient initial guesses to accelerate the convergence of\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the actual initial guesses\nare often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density\nmatrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing\nworks mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining\nhigh-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both\nnumerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering\nthe application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose\na method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density\nin a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural\nnetworks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to\nachieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems\nup to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric\nmodels. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing\nsystem sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis\nsets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally\ntransferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench\ndataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this\npromising direction.",

While recent work has\nexplored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance\nthrough post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This\nleaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to\nspecialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to\nevaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we\nintroduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating\nhigh-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,\nwithout relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically\npartitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across\nmultiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes\nLLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column\nbalancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models\nfine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization.

On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide\nmargins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at\ncomparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that\nschema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most\nrobust results.

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns\nabout proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits\noften fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in\nstructural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive\nexplanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.\nLeveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as\nunjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural\nbiases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant\nproperty independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning\nindividuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness\nsubstantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples\ntaken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in\nreal-world cases.",

    "summary": "This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces\n(RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the\ntransmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum\nefficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical\ncoupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for\nthe RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated\nunder both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel\nsettings.

To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we\noptimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to\nenhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily\non complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often\nchallenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components.\nTo circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with\nimplicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually\nrequires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of\nthe current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of\nchannel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among\nthe received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant\nachievable rates.

    "summary": "Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied\nintelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar\nenvironment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods\noften fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex\nscenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This\npaper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided\nKnowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist\nnavigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common\nsense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base\ncontaining 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align\nenvironmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive\nknowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,\nwhich guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by\nleveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data\nbias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose\nKnowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates\nlanguage, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods\non the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in\nterms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.",

    "summary": "Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which\nintelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to\nidentify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a\nstaged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then\nutilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally\nmaking decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach\nhas demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information\nprocessing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various\nmodules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper\npresents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for\nAudiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal\ninformation fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby\nreplacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This\ninnovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates\ninitial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This\nmethodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process\nwhile reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and\ngeneralization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents\nemploying the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior\nnavigation performance.",

    "summary": "The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)\npromises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular\nperformance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined\nchallenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent\narchitecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions\ninto executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system\nengages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks\nfor specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and\niteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.\nWe present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark\nexperiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to\nmulti-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent\nconfigurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural\ndesign (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our\nresults demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor\nfor success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over\n85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and\niterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy\n(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish\na clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for\nautonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular\ndesign, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and\nreliability in high-stakes scientific applications.

    "summary": "We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures\nlarge language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human\nintervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an\nLLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the\nability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different\ncomputational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize\nLLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,\nReplication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).\nUsing a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities\nand computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled\nenvironment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent\ntasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of\noverall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into\nspecific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides\nthe first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM\nself-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,\nto our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future\nmulti-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors\nwithin them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and\nproprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent\nself-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and\nmulti-agent decision-making.

This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC),\na novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains\ntogether tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined,\ncollectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final\nexecution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and\nsystematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of\nuser-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent\ntypes, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM\nagents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success\nrates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated\nframework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool\nchains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers\nstealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified\nmalicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find\nthat existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this\ngap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far\nstronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a\ncrucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire\naction sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated\nprompts or responses.",

    "summary": "Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'\nright to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data\nremoval post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current\nverifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to\ninfluence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely\nestablish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to\nconnect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only\nconfirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as\ngenuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification\nfor genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as\nusers' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the\nverification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for\nunlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding\nthe seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server\nrequires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a\nself-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including\nthe seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of\nthe original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a\ndelicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the\nself-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously\non the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model\nseeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through\nextensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective\nverification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as\nsearch engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and\nexternal knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable\nrewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of\nLLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward\nto supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,\nwhich limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address\nthis by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and\nencouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to\nannotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without\n\"golden\" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between\nlocal quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards\nhigher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To\naddress the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an\nRL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome\nverification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the\ntransparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a\nReward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process\nrewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and\ngeneralization.

    "summary": "Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet\nexisting models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge\nsources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This\nfragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts\nseamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,\nexemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through\nreal-time interaction. We present $\\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation\nframework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating\nthree knowledge paradigms: (i) $\\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from\nannotated datasets, (ii) $\\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot\nreference examples, and (iii) $\\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs\nlike clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge\nsources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts\ndefining $\\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating\n$\\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching\nbetween paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural\nmodifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse\nmodalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that\nK-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and\ninteractive segmentation settings.

Recent work shows\nthat selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal\nperformance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique\nremains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is\nbeneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and\nlearning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping\nenhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these\nobservations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations\nthrough the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as\npredicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular\nlayer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding\nfor multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that\nskipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and\nalso show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model\ndegradation.",

An essential part of the ViG framework is the\nnode-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution\nmethods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been\nexplored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex\nnode-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements\nis needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation\nmethod in which the query projections come from the node, while the key\nprojections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel\narchitecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention\naggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image\nrecognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it\nachieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to\ndownstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS\nCOCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

Contrary\nto recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing\nself-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation.

Further, we observe that larger models reconverge\nfaster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually\nreconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to\nlearn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token\nfrequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is\nuneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words\nconverge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens\nand content words).

Our key insight is that clarification requests during training\nreveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we\ncreate pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to\nsolve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4\npoints over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%\nif those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit\nsupervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be\neffectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit\nannotations.",

    "summary": "Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly\nobsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation\nmodels. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is\nbetter or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult\ntest cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of\nidentifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and\nnaturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for\nmodel failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model\niteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The\nLLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its\ngeneration of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more\nchallenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural\ntexts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation\nmodel during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and\nlanguages.",

    "summary": "As language models gain access to external tools via structured function\ncalls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step\ntasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)\nprovide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions\naccessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data\ncontamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework\nthat evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key\nidea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG\nwhere nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one\nfunction consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function\nschemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose\nthe correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows\nusers to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,\nand distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our\nFuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying\ndifficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose\nmodels with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance\ndeclines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected\nirrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong\nmodels often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or\nstale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in\nmulti-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple\nmitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent\nat each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains\nacross models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%\nfor GPT-5.",

However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE\nmodels from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the\nnumber of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit\nprecipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE\n(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly\ninto the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated\nexperts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:\ntop-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained\ncapabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.\nWe explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise\nrandomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that\na single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at\nvarious expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist\nmodels, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not\nonly unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by\nallocating different computational budgets to different model layers.

However, existing approaches\noften underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically\nfailing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This\nlimitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for\ncontrollable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm\ninspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from\nspeech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a\n``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual\n``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS\nmodel, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To\nrealize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically\nfor this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong\nperformance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming\nstrong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables\nremarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature\ncontrol abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates\nthat objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively\nunlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.",

    "summary": "Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable\nattention within the research community as a promising alternative to\nautoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower\ninference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely\nunderexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length\ndecoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,\na simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs\nfor fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding\narises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on\nthis insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing\ndistillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its\noriginal sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on\nmasked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across\nvarious benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the\nnumber of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the\nLLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on\nGSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of\nthoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally\ncostly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent\nthinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning\nsteps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack\ninterpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the\ncorrectness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we\nprovide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and\nhow external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We\nshow that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit\nhighly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably\npredict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these\ninsights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic\nalgorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to\noptimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse\nreasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect\nlatent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking\nprocesses. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,\nand LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking\nprocesses. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward\nmodeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed\ndirectly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,\nefficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of\nLLMs.",

Building on this hypothesis, we\nintroduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides\nSFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning\nprocess by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement\nlearning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by\nsampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The\nground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward\nsignal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes\nstatic, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the\ntoken level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while\nbypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive\nexperiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical\nreasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that\nOTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a\npowerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling\nevidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of\ngeneralization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to\nevaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative\nwriting. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality\nand explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that\ncurrent LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in\nthe prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for\nlong-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative\nwriting. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must\nchoose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100\npairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and\nGemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,\nwe assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source\nidentity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal\norigin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.\nResults reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency\nbias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear\nprovenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are\nespecially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended\nLitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost\nnever reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of\ncontent qualities.

Most existing approaches rely on manually\ndesigned processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.\nWhile a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied\nto specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate\nfeedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their\noperations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these\nlimitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that\nadaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task\nrequirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an\nexecutor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals\ndefined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on\nintermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the\nexecutor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with\ncontext-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded\nreasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including\nsocial reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code\ngeneration.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering\nand reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge\ncutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with\nexternal search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents\nto a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query\nformulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify\nerrors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental\ncomplexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective\napproach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher\nexplicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on\nwhether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of\ngoal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist\nspurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.\nExtensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and\nachieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate\nsubstantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the\nfragility of the search process.

    "summary": "Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal\ndistribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses\nthis by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is\nprohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods\nonly predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust\nother model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging\n(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using\nweight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing\ncomputational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that\nenhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with\nfunctional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic\nbase model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.\nSecond, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging\ncoefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal\ncomponent subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected\nproximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5\nmodels, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%\nwhile being up to 60x more efficient.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)\nprompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central\nquestion remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \\emph{faithful}\nto the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints\nthat function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work\non hinted vs.\\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT\nfaithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans\nfour datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models\n(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in\ncorrectness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data\nleak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator\nexpressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly\nacknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,\ncorrect hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks\nand logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks\nwith lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly\nuneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are\noften adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward\nverbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style\nmatters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style\nprompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect\nRLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data\nleak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that\nLLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure\nfaithfulness.",

    "summary": "The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to\ndetect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that\nlarge language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant\nresults. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve\ntheir performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text\nsimilarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual\nerror patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant\nsentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which\nretrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead\nof using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of\ngrammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to\nimprove the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets\nand create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is\nnot only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future\nstudies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets\nindicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.",

General-purpose language models often lack\ndomain-specific knowledge and tend to \"hallucinate\", which is particularly\nharmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify\nsustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of\ncredible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype\nFashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system\nthat extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,\nunstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several\nBERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and\nclimate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a\ndomain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via\nBayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze\ntheir own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface.

    "summary": "Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large\nlanguage models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing\nlatency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose\nContinuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and\ndifferentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or \"N:M\")\nsparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and\nweights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,\nwhile progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.\nSpecifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware\noptimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification\nacross all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the\nmagnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;\n3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to\nenhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns\nacross multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our\nresults demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art\nmethods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training\nresources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible\nperplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to\nthe dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,\nwe establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse\nmodel performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under\nquantization and fine-tuning scenarios.",

    "title": "Believing without Seeing: Quality Scores for Contextualizing\n  Vision-Language Model Explanations",
    "summary": "When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the\naccompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting\nVLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model\npredictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can\neasily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy\nundesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two\ncomplementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring\nfunctions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an\nexplanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how\nwell the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's\nprediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these\nquality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than\nexisting explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants\nhave to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual\ncontext. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations\nimproves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,\nincluding a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect\npredictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores\nin fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for\nautomated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities\nrelated to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks\n(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large\nlanguage models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical\ninterview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz\n(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to\nDNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot\ncounts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based\nmodels in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups\nsuch as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared\nto DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among\nfairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the\nworst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing\ndemographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.\nIn contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but\nperforms less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps\nmitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of\nshots does not lead to further reductions in disparities.

To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel\nmethod, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the\nrotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree\nin the continuous unlearning process.

However, we argue that current large-scale\nreasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse\nmathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about\nwhether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles\nor merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down\ncomplex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by\nthis, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic\ncapabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)\nfield-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,\ngeometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different\nlevels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with\nformal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose\ncorresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,\nand conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities\ninfluence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific\natomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show\nmany interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances\nof models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic\ncapabilities.

To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework\nto incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO\nvia the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in\nCLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse\nautoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative\nsamples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation\nfrom the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative\nsupervision.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization\n(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of\nthe back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes\nnoisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while\nsimultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.\nIn the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and\nconstructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to\neliminate data biases within these paths.

    "summary": "Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key\nlimitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are\n\"unsolvable\" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on\nproblems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.\nConsequently, the model's \"upper limit\" remains unchanged after RL training,\neven though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.\nThese hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards\nand thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,\nwe propose NuRL, a \"nudging\" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM\nreasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the\nproblem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the\nmodel generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge\nneeded to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the\nbase policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be\ninjected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and\nregenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint\nboosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals\nfor previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,\navoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves\nconsistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining\ncomplementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper\nlimit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.\nFurthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and\nwhen hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and\nhigh-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has\nconverged.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal\nPairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of\nLLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of\n1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these\nminimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from\nan official online resource maintained by a Qu\\'ebec government institution.\nEach pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the\nsentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used\nto compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different\nLLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher\nprobabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.\nWe find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear\nhierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on\nphenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical\nlimitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these\nspecific tasks.",

    "summary": "Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly\nthrough the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about\nwhich topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to\ncover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a\nchallenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to\npresent), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to\nenable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our\npipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time\nnews scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,\ntone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per\nday. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the\nsentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the\nways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.\nIn addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform\nfor convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions\nestablish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing\nempirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus\nover time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the\n150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can\nreveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic\nresearch and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.",

    "summary": "Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which\nenable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt\nin NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous\nwork, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily\nlarge number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their\nexpressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a\ncontext represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a\nfinite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability\nmeasures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,\nproving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the\ndynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,\nwe study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We\nfully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to\nbe represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,\nthese include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally\napproximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These\nproperties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part\nof their Fr\\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that\nthe solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,\nfor interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy\nproblem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be\napproximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the\nmeasure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the\ninfinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with\na Vlasov flow.",

    "summary": "Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in\nlarge-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further\nimproving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning\nprocess step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models\ntypically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each\nintermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation\nis in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked\nsentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a\nprincipled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without\nexplicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process\nreward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the\nenhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been\npost-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).\nWe provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided\nsampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation\nbenchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training\nmethods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and\nmodel types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish\nRFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning\nwithout reliance on external reward models.",

    "summary": "While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a\nsignificant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we\nintroduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable\nRewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by\ncircumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our\napproach employs a high-performing English LLM as a \"pivot\" model to generate\nreference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded\nbased on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,\neffectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across\nlanguages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,\nincluding those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive\nexperiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our\nmethod significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other\nlanguages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,\nour PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,\ndemonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly\nmultilingual reasoning agents.",

While LLMs can express their confidence\nin human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have\nempirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on\ninstances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We\nhypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened\nsuggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;\nwe empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on\nlower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce\nDistractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an\nLLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence\nindependently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative\nclaims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve\ncalibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting\nnormalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator\nconfidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as\nleveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized\nconfidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,\nallowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into\nDINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and\ntherefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone\ncannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference\ncalls outperforming self-consistency at 100.",

In this context, scientific simulators, which play a\nvital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval\nsource to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,\nexisting RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific\nsimulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve\nfrom scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form\nanswers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG\nframework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering\nclimate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations\nand human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator\nretrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities.

This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent\nin current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often\nmiss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the\nsolution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo\nTree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that\nrely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into\nthe training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit\nassignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,\nDeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,\nwhich leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training\nsteps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that\nprioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with\nentropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)\nadaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.\nExperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves\n62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B\nreasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training\napproaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration\nover brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation\nfor advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for\nscaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged\ncomputation.",

    "title": "Fingerprinting LLMs via Prompt Injection",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through\npost-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it\nchallenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing\nprovenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals\ninto the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published\nmodels, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random\nprompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose\nLLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by\nexploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is\nthat by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences,\nwe can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to\npost-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that\napplies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees.\nWe evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or\nquantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive\nrates while keeping false positive rates near zero.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning\ntasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand\ncandidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.\nAlthough effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in\nterms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning\nprocess, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math\nreasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of\nreasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling\nframework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and\nperforms search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose\nreasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the\nsearch to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further\nintroduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes\nsampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident\nsteps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the\nreasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code\ngeneration benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves\naccuracy while reducing redundant computation.",

While\nmulti-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest\nthat the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus\nsuitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity\nis largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared\nknowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and\ntransfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \\textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric\nmulti-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in\nmulti-task fine-tuning, and \\textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients\nin federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,\nthrough a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous\nranks across clients.

    "summary": "Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language\nmodels have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable\noutcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex\ntasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges\ndue to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous\nnature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate\ncorrectness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend\nbeyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of\nboth external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on\nimproving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting\ndocuments, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and\ndiminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose\nthe Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level\nthinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.\nGiven a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the\nfaithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then\napplies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring\nreward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness\nevaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both\nexternal and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that\nTRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and\nincorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both\nanswer correctness and usefulness.",

In response to the scarcity of value\nconflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an\nautomatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a\nuser-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in\nwhich a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the\nset. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written \"user prompt\" and\nevaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the\nvalue set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended\nevaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,\nsuch as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user\nautonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including\ndetailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a\ntarget ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate\nsuccess at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict.

In this work, we\nintroduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion\nmodel via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained\nimage conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the\ncomplex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while\nreserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve\nthis, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy.

    "summary": "Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high\ndimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper\npresents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both\ndeep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a\nsystematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed\nmethod fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer\nnetwork (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant\nfeature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,\nto obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature\nredundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among\nthese, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and\nglobal structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline\nintegrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means\nclustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification\naccuracy of 83. 3\\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These\nfindings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a\npre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality\nand overall classification performance.",

    "summary": "The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing\nblur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once\nthe image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is\nundesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose\nDiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image\nconditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we\ndesign a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the\ntraining requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in\nthe same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we\ndevelop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with\nvarying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that\ntraining with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF\nbehaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger\nconstraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos\nof different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we\npropose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF\nmanipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically\ngrounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully\naligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be\ncombined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to\nevaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of\nscenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography\nand generative AI applications.",

Accurate\nidentification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are\ncritical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization\npathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains\ngoverns carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis\nis still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present\nan automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that\nenables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and\ndefect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x\narchitecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i)\nAdaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and\nfine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing;\nand (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves\nfine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary\nrecognition.

This paper presents an ensemble of pre-trained vision\ntransformers (ViTs) for accurately classifying endoscopic images of the GI\ntract to categorize gastrointestinal problems and illnesses.

However, existing methods often\nassume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking\ncalibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This\nwork systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world\nlightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion\nframework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three\nkey aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic\ndatasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.\nSecond, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to\nidentify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading\npropagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network\ntailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained\nmonocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging\nregions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy\nsignificantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.\nOn the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our\nmodel improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions.

QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max\nquantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero\nsuppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach\nreduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing\noutlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and\nempirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse\nactivation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on\nFLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.",

Previous methods typically\nrely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to\nnew scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and\nlimited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,\nautomatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or\nhuman involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based\non MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key\ncapabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven\nheuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving\nchain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG\nmechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly\ndetection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided\nheuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA\nemploys a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware\ntools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios.

To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a\nreasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval.

Existing TTS\napproaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and\nexternal reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to\nthe inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for\nNTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or\nauxiliary rewards.

Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled\ncategories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world\nscenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual\nExperts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates\nmulti-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of\ntwo modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which\nalternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to\njointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)\nMulti-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the\nsingle-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different\ngranularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective\ncross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the\nnumber of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical\nopen-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual\nrecognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,\nparticularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of\ncategory numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing\nthe exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\\%.

While many detection models aim\nto reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range\nrecognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.\nIn this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian\npose--including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation--as well as\nindividual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five\npedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)\nalongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity\nPersons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal\nOpportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To\nassess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our\nfindings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight\nelbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative\nimpact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN\nachieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all\nattributes.

However, their capacity to comprehend\nhuman-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of\ncomprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the\nhuman-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.\nSuch high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the\nphysical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular\nstructures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed\nto provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene\nunderstanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three\nkey features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains\nwith 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.\n2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based\nactivities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the\nhigher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945\nreal-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality\nannotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation\npipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to\nfacilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the\nsingle-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual\nunderstanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and\njudgment question components, and complex questions of their combination.

Conventional methods often rely on isotropic Gaussian priors and\nsymmetric loss functions, misaligning latent representations with the task's\nasymmetric nature. We propose the Constrained Asymmetric Prior Wasserstein\nAutoencoder (CAP-WAE), a novel framework that addresses these challenges\nthrough three key innovations. Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder\n(WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving\nthe heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes. The latent space is\nfurther structured by a Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness (MAOC) loss\nto ensure grade-ordered separability. At the supervision level, we introduce a\ndirection-aware ordinal loss, where a lightweight head predicts asymmetric\ndispersions to generate soft labels that reflect clinical priorities by\npenalizing under-grading more severely. Stabilized by an adaptive multi-task\nweighting scheme, our end-to-end model requires minimal tuning. Across public\nDR benchmarks, CAP-WAE consistently achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic\nWeighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, surpassing both ordinal classification\nand latent generative baselines. t-SNE visualizations further reveal that our\nmethod reshapes the latent manifold into compact, grade-ordered clusters with\nreduced overlap.",

They either rely on\ncomputationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and\nzero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion\nmodels, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual\nAuto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and\nstrong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation\nfor resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a\npioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation\ncapabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection\nstrategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its\nlow-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.\nWe employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which\nis injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.\nConcurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are\nintegrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity\ntexture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is\nthe first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models.

Although gradient-based\nsolvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack\ntheoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,\nwe introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of\nDMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional\nentropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into\nthe inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its\nnoise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a\nreference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based\non these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for\nthe generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces\nuncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive\nexperiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ngradient-based solvers.

Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we\ngenerate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed\ninto absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students\non the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,\ntext attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:\nFG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three\nvisible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and\nrealistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension\ncomplements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors\non both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen\nevaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with\nFG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at\nhttps://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus",

    "summary": "We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation\ndetection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background\n(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,\nit consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an\nimplausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of\nlabel-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground\nalignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight\nsegmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation\nmasks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a\njoint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These\nscores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,\ngrounding, and token-level explanations.

To overcome these limitations, we make\nthe first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.\nThis is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native\nfor patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an\ninnovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter\nfor conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches\nto maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features\nfrom the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete\nsemantics of patches.

    "summary": "Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like\nOpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is\nessential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum\nof tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences\nin data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy\nhighly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this\nend, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM\ndata to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.\nSpecifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using\nmulti-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal\nspatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also\nintroduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient\npretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and\nmultimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from\ncommon RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more\ncomprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive\nexperiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the\nperformance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream\ntasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios.

Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)\nunion-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,\ncarrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended\nmodification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the\nability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we\npropose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval\nstage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the\noverlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby\nfiltering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a\ncleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we\nadapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary\nsemantic relevance judgments (\"Yes/No\"), which goes beyond CLIP's global\nfeature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level\nconsistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse\nretrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures\nprecise alignment with nuanced textual modifications.

    "summary": "The \"thinking with images\" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the\nreasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant\nchain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or\ngenerating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to\nfine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful\nmultimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves\nsubstantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural\ndesign, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for\nadvancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we\npresent DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text\ninterleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and\nresulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation\ninstructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we\ndesign a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively\ngenerates \"visual thoughts\" by operating directly in the visual embedding\nspace, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated\nimages. This design enables tool-free and more flexible \"thinking with images\".\nExtensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong\nperformance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness\nof the model design.",

    "summary": "Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained\nvision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)\nclassification by aligning visual features with textual representations,\nthereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.\nNevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail\nto capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities\n(\\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To\naddress this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning\n(\\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that\njointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both\nthe entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language\nmodels (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify\nmulti-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as\nslide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an\nentity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level\nfeatures, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific\nattributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity\nrepresentations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module\nthat can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations\nwithin and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into\na slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for\nslide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level\noutputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer\ncohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot\npathology diagnosis tasks.",

To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition\nbenchmark, a core challenge in product moderation.

We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing\nbrand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which\nresults in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,\nLogo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:\nLogo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual\nGrounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability.

Through dynamic\nsimilarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized\nweight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA\nestablishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only\n4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM.

Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod\ndataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across\nmultiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive\nperformance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%\nimprovement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure\ncompared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning.

    "summary": "Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects\nacross entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex\nreal-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1\nchallenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the\nrobustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term\nobject disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and\ninconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,\nConfidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1\nChallenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the\nremaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction\nability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce\na pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting\ncomplementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final\nmasks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,\nranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the\neffectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in\ncomplex scenarios.",

    "summary": "We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,\nformulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While\nrecovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most\nexisting approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic\nmethods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to\nmodel the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between\naccuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive\nwith state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D\nobservations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which\ngenerates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations\nunconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.\nOur model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the\ntransformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the\ntime-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small\nMLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the\nlatent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model\npredicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.",

    "summary": "Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic\nmanipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity\npreservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective\nfor intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid\ngeometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks\ndeviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,\ninaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,\na landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,\nidentity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark\ntokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial\ntokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a\nlocation-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens\nfor unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance\ninteractions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a\nlandmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target\nlandmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured\nchain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To\nmitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest\nbenchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained\ninstructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency.

    "summary": "Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for\ncontinuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed\ndistributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing\nminority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class\nproportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted\nFlow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under\nclass-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class\nlabel information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using\nmini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias\nthrough a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a\nlabel-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target\ndistribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority\nbased on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.\nBy incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically\nrecovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and\nempirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k\n> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed\nbenchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.",

    "summary": "Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize\ntraining data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior\nwork has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the\nfundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this\npaper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space\ndynamics to address the question: \"How do diffusion models memorize?\" We show\nthat memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during\nearly denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and\naccelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)\nmemorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is\nlarger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying\npredictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training\nimages into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and\nsteering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of\nintermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and\nreplaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising\nschedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,\nthese results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism\nof memorization in diffusion models.",

AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,\nright, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing\nthe object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial\nprior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click\npoint in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that\nchallenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo\nincorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the\nsame object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable\nlocalization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free\nlocalization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter\noverhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.",

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise\nfor medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered\nby the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating\ngenerative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark\ncomprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common\nophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,\nanatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting\nanatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and\ndemographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary\nLMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion\nwith substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task\ncoverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity\nclassification with international grading standards, and demographic\nprediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our\nevaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved\n~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance\nremained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging.

    "summary": "We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to\nregions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes\nto scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially\nvarying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,\npreferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their\nuniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to\nhigh-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at\ntheir original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization\nmethods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require\ndense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between\nthe prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user\nneeds for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized\nhigh-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a\nlow-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable\nnetwork that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a\nuser-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution\nobservations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy\nof uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages\nhigh-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a\nfeed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from\nthe initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided\ndensification mechanism that effectively captures details under large\nresolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance\nin local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to\n$1024\\times1024$ resolution.",

Few-shot learning\nmethods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled\nexamples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot\nlearning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical\napplications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require\nlearning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously\nknown ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot\nclassification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been\nscarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a\nlarge-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public\ndatabases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for\nstandard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating\nmulti-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a\nstandard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide\nrange of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate\nthat increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training\nexamples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer\nlearning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not\nbeing tailored for few-shot learning.

    "summary": "Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small\nrisk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving\nsurvival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor\noutcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal\nnevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians\nwithout specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low\nresolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of\nsegmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise\nsegmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust\ndiagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated\neffectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of\nannotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though\naccurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical\napplications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines\nmathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,\nleveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,\nreduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant\nperformance gains on high-resolution fundus images.

Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)\nStrategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in \"Who Is the\nSpy\"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions\nacross multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously\ngenerate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from\nArbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate\ngames from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability\nacross diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We\ndemonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:\nCLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images.

Existing behavioral control methods face\nsignificant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden\nby user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires\ninvasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with\nAPI-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that\ntransfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,\nwe introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection\n(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.\nWe demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of\nVLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual\ninputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for\nruntime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when\nan underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be\nsteered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based\ninterventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on\nopen-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment\ndirections: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific\nsteering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity\nclosely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative\nsteering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving\ndirectional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and\nclosed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%\nperformance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.",

    "summary": "Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)\nhas gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,\ncommon-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively\napplying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We\nargue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are\nasked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not\nreally see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for\nsemantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,\nleaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable\nperceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited\nvisual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically\nuses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,\nheterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful\nvisual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting\nin catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue\ncapabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before\nreasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive\nartifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that\nsubsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose\nForensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for\nmulti-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose\nExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's\nexplainability for image forensics from five key aspects.

    "title": "Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and\n  Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data",
    "summary": "Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable\ncorresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration\n(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the\nsubtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data\nheterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for\nPan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,\nRADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning\nRadiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a\nnovel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that\ncan better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to\nimprove uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the\nproposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more\neffectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we\nfuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level\nto improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed\napproach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps\nand robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification\napproaches.",

    "title": "DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models",
    "summary": "Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks\nthrough text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,\nstate-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from\n2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human\naccuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they\nrequire task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to\nask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?\nWe take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show\nthat the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that\ntext-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to\nunlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex\nregression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually\nin pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through\nvisual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller\nmodels, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over\n2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.\nInterestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with\nDepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at\nboundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also\nenables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code\nand model will be released at the link below.",

    "summary": "Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging\ntask due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like\nConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more\nfundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To\naddress this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),\na novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical\npriors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that\nprocesses all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS\ndataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range\nforecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including\nSOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this\nclass of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal\nfusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.",

SpinBench is\ndesigned around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,\nthe ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under\nviewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive\ncapabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions\ngrounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set\nof fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,\nrotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively\nstructured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most\ndemanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37\nstate-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal\nsystematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,\nand inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling\nanalysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human\nsubjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\\%), task difficulty as measured by human\nresponse time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that\nSpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.\nWe believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs\nand highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space.

    "title": "Saliency Guided Longitudinal Medical Visual Question Answering",
    "summary": "Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing\npaired studies from different time points and answering questions about\nclinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the\nconsistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute\nsingle-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest\nX-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The\nmodel first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce\nnuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:\nstep 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates\nkeyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;\nstep 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the\nfinal answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that\nmatter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent\nattention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains\ncompetitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing\nintrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are\ngeneral-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting\npracticality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned\ngeneration with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal\nreasoning in medical VQA.",

However, the presence of vital\nsignals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can\nreveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional\nstates of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that\nedits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,\nwe encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational\nAutoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen\ntext encoder.

We apply Feature-wise Linear\nModulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the\ndegradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate\nphysiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show\nthat our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and\nSSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation\nerror of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.\nOur design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as\nanonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos\nwith desired vital signs.",

    "summary": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance\nthe reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their\nstep-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either\ntreat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step\ndependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.\nConsequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in\nsequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations\nmake downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal\nperformance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that\nframes LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The\nreward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps\nbut also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By\nenforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal\nrelationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing\nprecise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit\nassignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,\nthe rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.\nExperiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning\ndemonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering\na principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more\nrobust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without\nrelying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.",

Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the\naortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and\ncell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical\nvulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that\ndrive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate\nsynthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees\nof elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we\nconstruct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train\nneural networks that predict the initiating combined insult.

We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained\nusing only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical\ndata (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors\nare significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the\nadded value of distensibility information.

Inspired by system audit provenance graphs,\nDeepProv models the computational information flow of a DNN's inference process\nthrough Inference Provenance Graphs (IPGs). These graphs provide a detailed\nstructural representation of the behavior of DNN, allowing both empirical and\nstructural analysis. DeepProv uses these insights to systematically repair DNNs\nfor specific objectives, such as improving robustness, privacy, or fairness.\n  We instantiate DeepProv with adversarial robustness as the goal of model\nrepair and conduct extensive case studies to evaluate its effectiveness. Our\nresults demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability across diverse\nclassification tasks, attack scenarios, and model complexities. DeepProv\nautomatically identifies repair actions at the node and edge-level within IPGs,\nsignificantly enhancing the robustness of the model. In particular, applying\nDeepProv repair strategies to just a single layer of a DNN yields an average\n55% improvement in adversarial accuracy. Moreover, DeepProv complements\nexisting defenses, achieving substantial gains in adversarial robustness.\nBeyond robustness, we demonstrate the broader potential of DeepProv as an\nadaptable system to characterize DNN behavior in other critical areas, such as\nprivacy auditing and fairness analysis.",

However, all existing measures of global\ndimensionality are sensitive to the number of samples, i.e., the number of rows\nand columns of the sample matrix. We show that, in particular, the\nparticipation ratio of eigenvalues, a popular measure of global dimensionality,\nis highly biased with small sample sizes, and propose a bias-corrected\nestimator that is more accurate with finite samples and with noise. On\nsynthetic data examples, we demonstrate that our estimator can recover the true\nknown dimensionality. We apply our estimator to neural brain recordings,\nincluding calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and fMRI data, and\nto the neural activations in a large language model and show our estimator is\ninvariant to the sample size.

Manually confirming responses\nfrom a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower\ndeveloper productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In\nthis paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided\nby a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps.

    "summary": "Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the\nquadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence\nparallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing\nthe query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q\ntensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather\ncommunication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,\nrestricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the\nmismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the\nAlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is\ncomposed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a\nvery limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.\n  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we\nidentify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple\northogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without\ninterference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather\nprimitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled\ndata transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a\ntopology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the\ncommunication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and\nprimitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and\nmulti-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate\nthat TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these\nmodern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring\nAttention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention.

We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for\nanswers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often\nbegins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making\nextra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we\npropose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)\n-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a\nstop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following\ntoken as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and\nstabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential\nmoving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach\nenables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us\nto spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget\nfor all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token\nusage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black\nbox settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT\nis computed with proxy models.",

    "summary": "We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented\nSMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and\ntarget-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to\ntransform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.\nUnlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all\nsequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm\nfrom completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from\nthe sequence length. For \\textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a\nstronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and\ncompetitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead\noptimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with\na Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete\nflows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular\nOptimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher\ndocking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus\nestablishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early\nhit finding to multi-objective lead optimization.

    "summary": "Neural scaling laws are driving the machine learning community toward\ntraining ever-larger foundation models across domains, assuring high accuracy\nand transferable representations for extrapolative tasks. We test this promise\nin quantum chemistry by scaling model capacity and training data from quantum\nchemical calculations. As a generalization task, we evaluate the resulting\nmodels' predictions of the bond dissociation energy of neutral H$_2$, the\nsimplest possible molecule. We find that, regardless of dataset size or model\ncapacity, models trained only on stable structures fail dramatically to even\nqualitatively reproduce the H$_2$ energy curve. Only when compressed and\nstretched geometries are explicitly included in training do the predictions\nroughly resemble the correct shape. Nonetheless, the largest foundation models\ntrained on the largest and most diverse datasets containing dissociating\ndiatomics exhibit serious failures on simple diatomic molecules. Most\nstrikingly, they cannot reproduce the trivial repulsive energy curve of two\nbare protons, revealing their failure to learn the basic Coulomb's law involved\nin electronic structure theory. These results suggest that scaling alone is\ninsufficient for building reliable quantum chemical models.",

    "title": "Data-to-Energy Stochastic Dynamics",
    "summary": "The Schr\\\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic\ndynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain\ntransportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal\ntransport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections\nto diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the\nnatural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics\nonly for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this\npaper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\\\"odinger bridges\nwhen one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,\nwith no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the\niterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired\nby recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of\ndiffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy\nIPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports\nbetween multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our\nreinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation\nscheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\\\"odinger\nbridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion\ncoefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to\nthe problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative\nmodels, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method.

While the\nMIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,\ntransforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive\npreprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that\nrestrict accessibility to only highly technical users.\n  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency\ntriage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital\nmortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting\nwith vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and\n(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.\nLarge language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by\n(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)\nprioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema\nalignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.\n  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,\nillustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for\ntriage.

This paper addresses\nthese challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the\ngap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we\npropose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that\naugments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,\naligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal\nEEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate\ntest-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time\ntraining on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy\nminimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually\ncalibrate the model to each new input on the fly.

    "summary": "In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has\ngarnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making\nunder distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the\napplication of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when\nconsidering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To\naddress this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and\nindividual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as\nan efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and\ncomputationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the\napproximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step\nin the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general\ncases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust\noptimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal\nmodel, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical\ndistributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust\nlearning.",

    "summary": "Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to\ndetect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,\ntraditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every\nquery. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy\ninputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety\nmonitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult\nto assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce\nTruncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes\nfor dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be\ntrained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can\nearly-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger\nguardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:\nby evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can \"buy\" stronger\nguardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases\nexit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated\nonly for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two\nlarge-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with\nup to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based\nprobe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than\ntheir black-box counterparts.

    "summary": "Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that\naccelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent\nwork has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable\nsignature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV\nrely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and\nintroduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process\n(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the\ncharge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated\nuncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we\ninfer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling\nrobust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key\nbenefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,\n(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty\nquantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded\nBMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates\n(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method\nreliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while\ncorrectly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of\nGP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade\nmeasured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and\nrobustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating\ndetection.",

We propose a\nsimple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We\ndefine our model $q_\\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with\nlatent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,\nour idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable\ndistribution $q_\\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate\nthe learned density $q_\\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw\nsamples from $q_\\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed\nmodel allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster\nthan competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal\nFlow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural\nnetwork architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional\nmanifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with\nany objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles\nmulti-modal targets.

Through\ntheoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,\nwhile clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the\neffect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even\nwhen purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings\nhighlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward\nsignal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the\nreasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be\ndeliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive\nclip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately\nprevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.",

    "summary": "Distributed machine learning is critical for training deep learning models on\nlarge datasets and with numerous parameters. Current research primarily focuses\non leveraging additional hardware resources and powerful computing units to\naccelerate the training process. As a result, larger batch sizes are often\nemployed to speed up training. However, training with large batch sizes can\nlead to lower accuracy due to poor generalization. To address this issue, we\npropose the dual batch size learning scheme, a distributed training method\nbuilt on the parameter server framework. This approach maximizes training\nefficiency by utilizing the largest batch size that the hardware can support\nwhile incorporating a smaller batch size to enhance model generalization. By\nusing two different batch sizes simultaneously, this method reduces testing\nloss and enhances generalization, with minimal extra training time.\nAdditionally, to mitigate the time overhead caused by dual batch size learning,\nwe propose the cyclic progressive learning scheme. This technique gradually\nadjusts image resolution from low to high during training, significantly\nboosting training speed. By combining cyclic progressive learning with dual\nbatch size learning, our hybrid approach improves both model generalization and\ntraining efficiency. Experimental results using ResNet-18 show that, compared\nto conventional training methods, our method can improve accuracy by 3.3% while\nreducing training time by 10.6% on CIFAR-100, and improve accuracy by 0.1%\nwhile reducing training time by 35.7% on ImageNet.",

While node-level attacks exploit local\nmessage passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating\nglobal representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources\nof anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural\ndeviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label\nflipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly\ndetection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor\nframework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided\nby anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural\nand semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly\nimproving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that\nDPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability\ncompared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

In this work, we challenge this assumption\nby proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric\nactor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged\nsignals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy\ngradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical\nfoundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial\ninformation. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness\nmeasures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing\npractical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach\nempirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable\nenvironments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning\nefficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are\navailable.

While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses\non synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and\nasynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,\nand do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting\nintroduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot\nimplicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid\ncollisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the\nsystem, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges\nposed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We\ndevelop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between\nexploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their\narms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the\nfirst challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited\nby others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has\nleft, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm\nachieves a regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T \\log T} + {\\log T}/{\\Delta^2})$,\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the\nasynchronous and decentralized environment.

    "summary": "Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by\nleveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the\npresence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by\nlatent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the\nproblem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively\nincluded in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely\nexists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both\nobservational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality\ncontrol criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment\nselection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under\ninterventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal\ndiscovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address\nthis, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models\npost-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to\ninterventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,\nallowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying\ntrue causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a\nFine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,\nrepresented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably\nsound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent\nconfounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\\mathcal{FI}$-Markov\nequivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental\nresults on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method\nrecovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent\nconfounders.",

    "summary": "Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of\ngoverning partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these\nsimulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design\nspaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to\naccelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited\nby the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers\nof geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely\nuntapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,\nphysics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under\nlimited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry\nreconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE\nlabels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised\nmanner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as\ninputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted\nfor both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and\nintegrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three\nstate-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently\nimproves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point\ncloud inputs.

    "summary": "Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized\nsignal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated\ndiscriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on\nencouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how\natoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal\ndictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the\nrow-wise $L_\\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty\nencourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing\nthe number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the\nformulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which\nprovides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to\nprior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal\nhyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum\nDescription Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves\nsubstantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\\% reduction in RMSE)\nand enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the\navailable dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical\nanalysis.",

    "summary": "Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of\ndecision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify\na prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are\ndifficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an\nactivation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful\nexplanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to\nidentify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but\nare also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight\nautoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise\ncritical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The\ntraining objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,\nconsistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and\ncompactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The\nminimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting\nthe model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout\nprocedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we\nidentify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring\ninter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and\nfeature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.\nTogether, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal\ninput-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal\ncomputations driving model decisions.",

To address\nthis, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified\ntemporal interaction.

This dynamic\nrouting encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing\nskills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds\non a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are\nused to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal\nmultimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and\nthen show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance\nof MoE-based models.

Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by\npath-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops\nwhen a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,\nTinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of\nIMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower\ncost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP).

We first show that the input information available\nto the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the\npreconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on\nfeature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th\npower of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,\nwe prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the\nteacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how\nthe interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three\ncomplementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that\nthe learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced\nby the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting\nreduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed.

Singular\nValue Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing\npost-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a\nuniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous\ninformation included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial\nintra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode\nricher information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this\nwork, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,\na framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs\ncompression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to\nmeasure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via\na Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more\ncapacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression\nratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to\naccount for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with\ngrouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different\nscales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently\noutperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower\nperplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up\nto 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%\ncompression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.",

    "summary": "Collaborative and distributed learning techniques, such as Federated Learning\n(FL) and Split Learning (SL), hold significant promise for leveraging sensitive\ndata in privacy-critical domains. However, FL and SL suffer from key\nlimitations -- FL imposes substantial computational demands on clients, while\nSL leads to prolonged training times. To overcome these challenges, SplitFed\nLearning (SFL) was introduced as a hybrid approach that combines the strengths\nof FL and SL. Despite its advantages, SFL inherits scalability, performance,\nand security issues from SL. In this paper, we propose two novel frameworks:\nSharded SplitFed Learning (SSFL) and Blockchain-enabled SplitFed Learning\n(BSFL). SSFL addresses the scalability and performance constraints of SFL by\ndistributing the workload and communication overhead of the SL server across\nmultiple parallel shards. Building upon SSFL, BSFL replaces the centralized\nserver with a blockchain-based architecture that employs a committee-driven\nconsensus mechanism to enhance fairness and security. BSFL incorporates an\nevaluation mechanism to exclude poisoned or tampered model updates, thereby\nmitigating data poisoning and model integrity attacks. Experimental evaluations\nagainst baseline SL and SFL approaches show that SSFL improves performance and\nscalability by 31.2% and 85.2%, respectively. Furthermore, BSFL increases\nresilience to data poisoning attacks by 62.7% while maintaining superior\nperformance under normal operating conditions. To the best of our knowledge,\nBSFL is the first blockchain-enabled framework to implement an end-to-end\ndecentralized SplitFed Learning system.",

    "summary": "This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive\nworld latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team\ncoordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging\nfrom multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local\nobservations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space\nthat jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information\nby directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain\nfully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding\nthe inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower\ndecision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to\nbandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as\nan implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for\ncommunication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both\nvariants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team\ncoordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined\nwith existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.",

    "summary": "In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying\na single \"best\" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference\ncost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model\n(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for\neach query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the\nscarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified\nlabels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM\nresponses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based\ndata, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and\nmore scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We\ncast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and\npreference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response\nevaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further\nreveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known\ncausal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new\nperspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that\ncorrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and\nimprove routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off\nbetween cost and quality.",

The system was piloted with 79\nmiddle-school students, where LLM-generated grades and feedback were\nbenchmarked against teacher judgments. Grading closely aligned with teachers,\nand feedback helped many students revise errors and complete multi-step\ngeometry tasks.

    "summary": "Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data\nfrom noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow\nmatching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points\n$(\\mathbf{x}_0,\\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,\non average, with $\\mathbf{x}_1-\\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment\nlinking $\\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled\nindependently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching\nbatches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)\nsolver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is\nnot widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that\nOT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,\nwhich only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.\nUnfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring\n$O(n^2/\\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity\nfield, where $\\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be\ntypically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of\nOT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete\nformulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is\nusually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual\npotential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at\ntrain time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner\nproduct search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency\non $n/\\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all\ntraining metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on\nunconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.",

    "summary": "When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the\nenvironment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at\nthat source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on\nuncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes\nnoisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high\ncomputational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans\nmonitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for\nintrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).\nDuring exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error\nor novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions\nrather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design\nthat uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the\ndynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the\nmodel errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide\nexploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is\nzero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that\nthe error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We\nempirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy\nenvironments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.\nResults show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states\nin the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari.

However, the robustness of TGNNs\nagainst adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit\nthe temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack\nmethods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,\neasily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and\nfail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum\nimpact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box\nattack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose\ncritical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model\nto identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and\ndynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It\nthen employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection\n(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt\nessential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA\nminimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more\nchallenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets\nand four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)\ndemonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction\ntask, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a\nsubstantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

    "summary": "Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional\ncapabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by\nsubstantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many\nsparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse\nsparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance\ninference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse\nattention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni\nintroduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide\nrange of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse\nskipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse\ncomputations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs\noptimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to\neliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments\ndemonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity\nratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves\n2.5$\\times$-3.8$\\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of\nthe theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it\nenables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\\times$ end-to-end\nacceleration without degrading visual quality.",

    "summary": "Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by\nuncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a\npersistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across\noperating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work\ninvestigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)\nwithin a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter\nidentification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from\nthe same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related\ntasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise\ncharacteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear\nand cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under\nthree excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to\nreproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms\nwhen excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,\nthe MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for\nweakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance\nunder high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian\ninference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation\ndiscovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health\nmonitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of\nsystem physics.",

Second, open LLM developers have a variety of\nsocial, economic, and technological motivations, from democratizing AI access\nand promoting open science to building regional ecosystems and expanding\nlanguage representation.

Deep generative\nmodels like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture\nnonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples\nequally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples\nemphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.\n  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a\ngenerative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local\nuncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify\nuncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a\nsample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as\na proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:\n(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in\nuncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that\nconcentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.\n  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE\nconsistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional\noversampling and generative baselines.

    "summary": "We are on the cusp where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality\n(XR) are converging to unlock new paradigms of interactive computing. However,\na significant gap exists between the ecosystems of these two fields: while AI\nresearch and development is accelerated by mature frameworks like JAX and\nbenchmarks like LMArena, prototyping novel AI-driven XR interactions remains a\nhigh-friction process, often requiring practitioners to manually integrate\ndisparate, low-level systems for perception, rendering, and interaction. To\nbridge this gap, we present XR Blocks, a cross-platform framework designed to\naccelerate human-centered AI + XR innovation. XR Blocks strives to provide a\nmodular architecture with plug-and-play components for core abstraction in AI +\nXR: user, world, peers; interface, context, and agents. Crucially, it is\ndesigned with the mission of \"reducing frictions from idea to reality\", thus\naccelerating rapid prototyping of AI + XR apps. Built upon accessible\ntechnologies (WebXR, three.js, TensorFlow, Gemini), our toolkit lowers the\nbarrier to entry for XR creators. We demonstrate its utility through a set of\nopen-source templates, samples, and advanced demos, empowering the community to\nquickly move from concept to interactive XR prototype.

    "summary": "Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities\nin robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs)\nand learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision\nand language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact\nwithin the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a\ncomprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which\nis crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we\nintroduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively\nperceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory\nobjectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance\nperceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment\nscheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a\nperception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,\n3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To\nfurther enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future\nmultisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about\nsemantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust\nconditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the\nprevious state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,\ncontact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved\ngeneralization to unseen configurations.

Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative\ntransformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and\ninter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating\nSystem (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in\nSoftware-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The\nproposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form\nmethods which are less robust to noise.

This factorization avoids generative failures\nsuch as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors.

    "summary": "Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on\nsensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios,\nconsistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult\ndue to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for\nmotion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to\novercome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as\nobstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential\nsolution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for\nthe planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a\nhistory of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world\nmodels, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to\nreroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major\niterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search\nfor every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world\nmodels. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,\ndefer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH\nuses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each\nworld. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic\nsolutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than\none-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of\nresults from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a\nClearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost\ntrajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to\nsingle-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered,\nGEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average\nplanning time.",

Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns\nin data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery\nstrategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in\nspecific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and\ntask types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as\nforce/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment\ninteractions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their\nbroad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high\ntemporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely\nsignal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the\nsame way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency.\nWe examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies.\nTest scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and\nmultimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are\ncompared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion\npolicy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the\nintegration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation\nfrom both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data\nefficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust\ndetection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in\nfailures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned\nparts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were\nreliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.",

We introduce\nthe open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost,\neasy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses\noff-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be\nassembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD.\nThe ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with\nonly a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the utility of the\narticulated palm, we use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand\nto perform a classical in-hand manipulation task: cube reorientation. Our\nnovel, systematic experiments show that the simulated ISyHand outperforms the\ntwo most comparable hands in early training phases, that all three perform\nsimilarly well after policy convergence, and that the ISyHand significantly\noutperforms a fixed-palm version of its own design. Additionally, we deploy a\npolicy trained on cube reorientation on the real hand, demonstrating its\nability to perform real-world dexterous manipulation.",

    "summary": "An accurate odometry is essential for legged-wheel robots operating in\nunstructured terrains such as bumpy roads and staircases. Existing methods\noften suffer from pose drift due to their ignorance of terrain geometry. We\npropose a terrain-awared LiDAR-Inertial odometry (LIO) framework that\napproximates the terrain using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) whose centers are\nadaptively selected and weights are recursively updated. The resulting smooth\nterrain manifold enables ``soft constraints\" that regularize the odometry\noptimization and mitigates the $z$-axis pose drift under abrupt elevation\nchanges during robot's maneuver. To ensure the LIO's real-time performance, we\nfurther evaluate the RBF-related terms and calculate the inverse of the sparse\nkernel matrix with GPU parallelization. Experiments on unstructured terrains\ndemonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy than the\nstate-of-the-art baselines, especially in the scenarios that have continuous\nheight changes or sparse features when abrupt height changes occur.",

    "summary": "Humanoid robots have seen significant advancements in both design and\ncontrol, with a growing emphasis on integrating these aspects to enhance\noverall performance. Traditionally, robot design has followed a sequential\nprocess, where control algorithms are developed after the hardware is\nfinalized. However, this can be myopic and prevent robots to fully exploit\ntheir hardware capabilities. Recent approaches advocate for co-design,\noptimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic\ncapabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based\nCo-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with\nevolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy\nto the hardware. EA-CoRL comprises two key components: Design Evolution, which\nexplores the hardware choices using an evolutionary algorithm to identify\nefficient configurations, and Policy Continuous Adaptation, which fine-tunes a\ntask-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize performance\nrewards. We evaluate EA-CoRL by co-designing the actuators (gear ratios) and\ncontrol policy of the RH5 humanoid for a highly dynamic chin-up task,\npreviously unfeasible due to actuator limitations. Comparative results against\nstate-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods show that EA-CoRL achieves higher\nfitness score and broader design space exploration, highlighting the critical\nrole of continuous policy adaptation in robot co-design.",

Although Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and single-agent Path\nplanning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO) were both studied, M-PAMO remains\nunder-explored. Movable obstacles lead to new fundamental challenges as the\nstate space, which includes both agents and movable obstacles, grows\nexponentially with respect to the number of agents and movable obstacles. In\nparticular, movable obstacles often closely couple agents together spatially\nand temporally. This paper makes a first attempt to adapt and fuse the popular\nConflict-Based Search (CBS) and Prioritized Planning (PP) for MAPF, and a\nrecent single-agent PAMO planner called PAMO*, together to address M-PAMO.

Our contribution is the planar\nSignorini condition, a conic complementarity formulation that models general\nplanar contacts between rigid bodies. We prove that this formulation is\nequivalent to enforcing the punctual Signorini law across an entire contact\nsurface, thereby bridging the gap between discrete and continuous contact\nmodels. A geometric interpretation reveals that the framework naturally\ncaptures three physical regimes -sticking, separating, and tilting-within a\nunified complementarity structure. This leads to a principled extension of the\nclassical center of pressure, which we refer to as the extended center of\npressure. By establishing this connection, our work provides a mathematically\nconsistent and computationally tractable foundation for handling planar\ncontacts, with implications for both the accurate simulation of contact\ndynamics and the design of advanced control and optimization algorithms in\nlocomotion and manipulation.",

While research highlights the pragmatic value of emotional\nexpressiveness in human social communication, the extent to which robotic\nexpressiveness can or should influence empathic responses in children is\ngrounds for debate. In a pilot study with 22 children (aged 7-11) we begin to\nexplore the ways in which different levels of embodied expressiveness (body\nonly, face only, body and face) of two basic emotions (happiness and sadness)\ndisplayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) might modify children's\nbehavior in a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. We observed that\nchildren aligned their behavior to the robot's inferred emotional state.\nHowever, higher levels of expressiveness did not result in increased alignment.\nThe preliminary results reported here provide a starting point for reflecting\non robotic expressiveness and its role in shaping children's social-emotional\nbehavior toward robots as social peers in the near future.",

Existing\nlocalization solutions typically rely on post-processed radar point clouds as\nlandmark points.

While\nvision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their\ndeployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of\nlarge-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with\nmulti-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards\nfor fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we\npropose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate\nlong-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in\nreal-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM\nincentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial\nreasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To\nobtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface\nframework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An\nautomated annotation engine converts each demonstration into\nvision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores\nthe generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the\nground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as\na planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches\nor exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude\nlarger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more\nthan 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall\nsuccess by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the\nplanner.

Theoretically, we derive a variational\nlower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective\nenhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP--AG\nsignificantly outperforms state--of--the--art methods across simulation\nbenchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks.

We\npresent a decoupled framework that learns each component where it is most\nreliable: control policies are trained in simulation with privileged state to\nmaster spatial layouts and manipulation dynamics, while perception is adapted\nonly at deployment to bridge real observations to the frozen control policy.\nOur key insight is that control strategies and action patterns are universal\nacross environments and can be learned in simulation through systematic\nrandomization, while perception is inherently domain-specific and must be\nlearned where visual observations are authentic. Unlike existing end-to-end\napproaches that require extensive real-world data, our method achieves strong\nperformance with only 10-20 real demonstrations by reducing the complex\nsim-to-real problem to a structured perception alignment task. We validate our\napproach on tabletop manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior data efficiency\nand out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines. The\nlearned policies successfully handle object positions and scales beyond the\ntraining distribution, confirming that decoupling perception from control\nfundamentally improves sim-to-real transfer.",

    "summary": "Despite progress in both traditional dexterous grasping pipelines and recent\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches, the grasp execution stage remains\nprone to pose inaccuracies, especially in long-horizon tasks, which undermines\noverall performance. To address this \"last-mile\" challenge, we propose\nTacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose\nrefinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger\nfingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based\non tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We\ndesign a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple\nfingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train\nthis policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile\nmodel in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system.\nComparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning\nwith a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over\nsimulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the\neffectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using\nonly tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable\narbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone.\nProject website is available at https://sites.google.com/view/tacrefinenet",

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training\nvision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by\nsparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by\nintroducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with\nbehavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive\nactions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the\ndensity of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning\nloss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that\ncontinually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative\nweight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone\nauxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process.\nExperiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over\nsupervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to\nsuccess (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA\npost-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.",

    "summary": "Embodied navigation presents a core challenge for intelligent robots,\nrequiring the comprehension of visual environments, natural language\ninstructions, and autonomous exploration. Existing models often fall short in\noffering a unified solution across diverse navigation paradigms, resulting in\nlow success rates and limited generalization. We introduce OmniNav, a unified\nframework addressing instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal navigation, and\nfrontier-based exploration within a single architecture. Our approach features\na lightweight, low-latency policy that accurately predicts continuous-space\nwaypoints (coordinates and orientations). This policy surpasses action-chunk\nmethods in precision and supports real-world deployment at control frequencies\nup to 5 Hz. Architecturally, OmniNav employs a fast-slow system design: a fast\nmodule generates waypoints using short-horizon visual context and subtasks,\nwhile a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon\nobservations and candidate frontiers to select subsequent subgoals and\nsubtasks. This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory\ncoherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.\nCrucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation\npolicy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and\nobjects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale,\ngeneral-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and\nvisual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen. This significantly\nimproves success rates and robustness. Extensive experiments confirm OmniNav's\nstate-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks, with\nreal-world deployment further validating its efficacy. OmniNav provides\npractical insights for embodied navigation, charting a scalable path towards\nversatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence.",

    "summary": "We propose a novel hierarchical diffusion planner that embeds task and motion\nstructure directly in the noise model. Unlike standard diffusion-based planners\nthat use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, we employ a family of\ntask-conditioned structured Gaussians whose means and covariances are derived\nfrom Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP): sparse, task-centric key states\nor their associated timings (or both) are treated as noisy observations to\nproduce a prior instance. We first generalize the standard diffusion process to\nbiased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior\nexpressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from\ntrajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned\nstructured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the\nfull trajectory under that fixed prior. Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and\nKUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and\nstronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies\nindicate that explicitly structuring the corruption process offers benefits\nbeyond simply conditioning the neural network. Overall, our method concentrates\nprobability mass of prior near feasible, smooth, and semantically meaningful\ntrajectories while maintaining tractability.

    "summary": "Humanoid whole-body locomotion control is a critical approach for humanoid\nrobots to leverage their inherent advantages. Learning-based control methods\nderived from retargeted human motion data provide an effective means of\naddressing this issue. However, because most current human datasets lack\nmeasured force data, and learning-based robot control is largely\nposition-based, achieving appropriate compliance during interaction with real\nenvironments remains challenging. This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline\n(CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based\nstructure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning\nframework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is\nproposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based\ncontroller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is\ncombined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is\nguided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space\ncompliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through\ncompliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold,\nensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed\nstrategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external\ndisturbances under different compliance settings.",
