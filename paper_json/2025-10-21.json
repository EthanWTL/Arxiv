    "title": "Grasp Any Region: Towards Precise, Contextual Pixel Understanding for\n  Multimodal LLMs",
    "summary": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic\nunderstanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,\nrequiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object\ninter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,\nprevious attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in\nisolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce\nGrasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.\nEmpowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports\n(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)\nmodeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally\nachieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form\nquestions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to\nactive dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a\nmore accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more\nimportantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple\nregions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains\nthe state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5\non DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple\nprompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B\non GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms\nin-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong\ncapabilities can be easily transferred to videos.",

    "title": "Bee: A High-Quality Corpus and Full-Stack Suite to Unlock Advanced Fully\n  Open MLLMs",
    "summary": "Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind\nproprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality\nfor supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often\nplagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,\nsuch as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model\ncapabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary\ncontributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising\napproximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning\ntechniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment\nstrategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its\nunderlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and\nadaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset\nreleases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B\nmodel on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is\ncompetitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as\nInternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational\nresources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite\ncomprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;\nand the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data\nquality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly\ncompetitive with their semi-open counterparts.",

    "title": "How Do LLMs Use Their Depth?",
    "summary": "Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth\nuniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise\nprediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models.",

    "summary": "Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle\nto effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and\ncomplex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless\ninteractions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and\nutilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce\nsubstantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new\nmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance\nand efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of\nhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,\ncognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information\nthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to their\ntopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based\ngroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,\nlong-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that\ndecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with\nGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in\naccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API\ncalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

    "summary": "Rapid electrification and decarbonization are increasing the complexity of\ndistribution grid (DG) operation and planning, necessitating advanced\ncomputational analyses to ensure reliability and resilience. These analyses\ndepend on disparate workflows comprising complex models, function calls, and\ndata pipelines that require substantial expert knowledge and remain difficult\nto automate. Workforce and budget constraints further limit utilities' ability\nto apply such analyses at scale. To address this gap, we build an agentic\nsystem PowerChain, which is capable of autonomously performing complex grid\nanalyses. Existing agentic AI systems are typically developed in a bottom-up\nmanner with customized context for predefined analysis tasks; therefore, they\ndo not generalize to tasks that the agent has never seen. In comparison, to\ngeneralize to unseen DG analysis tasks, PowerChain dynamically generates\nstructured context by leveraging supervisory signals from self-contained power\nsystems tools (e.g., GridLAB-D) and an optimized set of expert-annotated and\nverified reasoning trajectories. For complex DG tasks defined in natural\nlanguage, empirical results on real utility data demonstrate that PowerChain\nachieves up to a 144/% improvement in performance over baselines.",

But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is\nkey in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text\nspans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of\ncoreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention?\nThis capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence\nof ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that\nLLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference\ndisambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they\ncannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off:\nthough models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful\nperformance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.",

    "summary": "We present Ring-1T, the first open-source, state-of-the-art thinking model\nwith a trillion-scale parameter. It features 1 trillion total parameters and\nactivates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a\ntrillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including\ntrain-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and\nbottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected\ninnovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy\nmasking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches;\n(2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget\nby dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and\n(3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic\nbottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers\nbreakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on\nHMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1.

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel Lyapunov-Based Quantum Reinforcement Learning\n(LQRL) framework that integrates quantum policy optimization with Lyapunov\nstability analysis for continuous-time vehicle control. The proposed approach\ncombines the representational power of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with\na stability-aware policy gradient mechanism to ensure asymptotic convergence\nand safe decision-making under dynamic environments. The vehicle longitudinal\ncontrol problem was formulated as a continuous-state reinforcement learning\ntask, where the quantum policy network generates control actions subject to\nLyapunov stability constraints. Simulation experiments were conducted in a\nclosed-loop adaptive cruise control scenario using a quantum-inspired policy\ntrained under stability feedback. The results demonstrate that the LQRL\nframework successfully embeds Lyapunov stability verification into quantum\npolicy learning, enabling interpretable and stability-aware control\nperformance. Although transient overshoot and Lyapunov divergence were observed\nunder aggressive acceleration, the system maintained bounded state evolution,\nvalidating the feasibility of integrating safety guarantees within quantum\nreinforcement learning architectures. The proposed framework provides a\nfoundational step toward provably safe quantum control in autonomous systems\nand hybrid quantum-classical optimization domains.",

    "summary": "Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world\nimage super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic\ndetails. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different\nnoise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although\nthis randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider\nperceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR\nperformance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference\nOptimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative\nmodels with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.\nWe construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and\nno-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human\npreference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and\nnatural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the\nstandard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from\noutputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection\nratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,\nwhile larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.\nFurthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively\nweights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group\ndiversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments\nacross both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR\nsignificantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world\nbenchmarks.",

    "title": "How Transformers Learn In-Context Recall Tasks? Optimality, Training\n  Dynamics and Generalization",
    "summary": "We study the approximation capabilities, convergence speeds and\non-convergence behaviors of transformers trained on in-context recall tasks --\nwhich requires to recognize the \\emph{positional} association between a pair of\ntokens from in-context examples. Existing theoretical results only focus on the\nin-context reasoning behavior of transformers after being trained for the\n\\emph{one} gradient descent step. It remains unclear what is the on-convergence\nbehavior of transformers being trained by gradient descent and how fast the\nconvergence rate is. In addition, the generalization of transformers in\none-step in-context reasoning has not been formally investigated. This work\naddresses these gaps. We first show that a class of transformers with either\nlinear, ReLU or softmax attentions, is provably Bayes-optimal for an in-context\nrecall task. When being trained with gradient descent, we show via a\nfinite-sample analysis that the expected loss converges at linear rate to the\nBayes risks. Moreover, we show that the trained transformers exhibit\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, i.e., generalizing to samples outside\nof the population distribution. Our theoretical findings are further supported\nby extensive empirical validations, showing that \\emph{without} proper\nparameterization, models with larger expressive power surprisingly \\emph{fail}\nto generalize OOD after being trained by gradient descent.",

Existing benchmarks focus on general multimodal capabilities but fail to\ncapture the complexity of astronomical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nAstroMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in\nastronomical image understanding. AstroMMBench comprises 621 multiple-choice\nquestions across six astrophysical subfields, curated and reviewed by 15 domain\nexperts for quality and relevance. We conducted an extensive evaluation of 25\ndiverse MLLMs, including 22 open-source and 3 closed-source models, using\nAstroMMBench. The results show that Ovis2-34B achieved the highest overall\naccuracy (70.5%), demonstrating leading capabilities even compared to strong\nclosed-source models. Performance showed variations across the six\nastrophysical subfields, proving particularly challenging in domains like\ncosmology and high-energy astrophysics, while models performed relatively\nbetter in others, such as instrumentation and solar astrophysics. These\nfindings underscore the vital role of domain-specific benchmarks like\nAstroMMBench in critically evaluating MLLM performance and guiding their\ntargeted development for scientific applications.

    "summary": "Neural networks increasingly run on hardware outside the user's control\n(cloud GPUs, inference marketplaces). Yet ML-as-a-Service reveals little about\nwhat actually ran or whether returned outputs faithfully reflect the intended\ninputs. Users lack recourse against service downgrades (model swaps,\nquantization, graph rewrites, or discrepancies like altered ad embeddings).\nVerifying outputs is hard because floating-point(FP) execution on heterogeneous\naccelerators is inherently nondeterministic. Existing approaches are either\nimpractical for real FP neural networks or reintroduce vendor trust. We present\nNAO: a Nondeterministic tolerance Aware Optimistic verification protocol that\naccepts outputs within principled operator-level acceptance regions rather than\nrequiring bitwise equality. NAO combines two error models: (i) sound\nper-operator IEEE-754 worst-case bounds and (ii) tight empirical percentile\nprofiles calibrated across hardware. Discrepancies trigger a Merkle-anchored,\nthreshold-guided dispute game that recursively partitions the computation graph\nuntil one operator remains, where adjudication reduces to a lightweight\ntheoretical-bound check or a small honest-majority vote against empirical\nthresholds. Unchallenged results finalize after a challenge window, without\nrequiring trusted hardware or deterministic kernels. We implement NAO as a\nPyTorch-compatible runtime and a contract layer currently deployed on Ethereum\nHolesky testnet. The runtime instruments graphs, computes per-operator bounds,\nand runs unmodified vendor kernels in FP32 with negligible overhead (0.3% on\nQwen3-8B). Across CNNs, Transformers and diffusion models on A100, H100,\nRTX6000, RTX4090, empirical thresholds are $10^2-10^3$ times tighter than\ntheoretical bounds, and bound-aware adversarial attacks achieve 0% success.

This paper initiates a\ntheoretical study of ICL for regression of H\\\"older functions on manifolds.

Building on this insight, we derive generalization error\nbounds in terms of the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a\nsufficient number of training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the\nminimax regression rate of H\\\"older functions on manifolds, which scales\nexponentially with the intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the\nambient space dimension. Our result also characterizes how the generalization\nerror scales with the number of training tasks, shedding light on the\ncomplexity of transformers as in-context kernel algorithm learners.

Moreover, even under identical conditions,\nthe routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated\nforward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout\nRouting Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the\ninference engine and replays them during training.

    "title": "Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based\n  Structures",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on\ninformation within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting\nwith structured data like code files, another popular method,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment\nthe model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best\nrepresent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,\nparticularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a\nnovel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a\nGitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each\nhierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a\nknowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using\nRAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the\ngenerated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable\nacross both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the\nretriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that\nleveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and\nscalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.",

This work studies in-context counterfactual reasoning in language\nmodels, that is, the ability to predict consequences of a hypothetical\nscenario. We focus on a well-defined, synthetic linear regression task that\nrequires noise abduction. Accurate prediction is based on (1) inferring an\nunobserved latent concept and (2) copying contextual noise from factual\nobservations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual\nreasoning. Further, we enhance existing identifiability results and reduce\ncounterfactual reasoning for a broad class of functions to a transformation on\nin-context observations. In Transformers, we find that self-attention, model\ndepth and pre-training data diversity drive performance. Moreover, we provide\nmechanistic evidence that the latent concept is linearly represented in the\nresidual stream and we introduce designated \\textit{noise abduction heads}\ncentral to performing counterfactual reasoning.

    "summary": "Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.\nAlthough end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,\ninterpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban\nscenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with\nnon-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind\nAI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability\nwhile optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we\npropose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by\ngenerating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us\nto explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We\nconduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and\nvalidate our method on the CARLA benchmarks.

    "summary": "To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features\n(e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in\nengineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key\nchallenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an\nintractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing\non designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about\ndata characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting\ntheir full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing\na generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.\nThrough causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most\ndirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive\ncounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a\ncausal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide\na test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves\nas a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.\nExtensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably\nimprove arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the\ncases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art\napproach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation,\nCausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more\nefficient.

While a growing body of theoretical work has\nemerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning\nlarge language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise\ncomparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,\nThekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and\nranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even\ndeteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information\navailable. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for\nranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that\nselects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the\noffered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{d}{T} \\sqrt{ \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{1}{|S_t|}}\n\\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature\ndimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result\nshows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,\nthe bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,\nwhich was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we\nestablish a near-matching lower bound of $\\Omega \\left( \\frac{d}{K \\sqrt{T}}\n\\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that\nexplicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.",

    "summary": "Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are\ninherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the\nsame output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's\nrepresentations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove\nmathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input\nsequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are\ninjective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and\npreserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through\nbillions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and\nobserve no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce\nSipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact\ninput text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and\ndemonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes\ninjectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with\ndirect implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.",

    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) become progressively more embedded in\nclinical decision-support, documentation, and patient-information systems,\nensuring their privacy and trustworthiness has emerged as an imperative\nchallenge for the healthcare sector. Fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive electronic\nhealth record (EHR) data improves domain alignment but also raises the risk of\nexposing patient information through model behaviors. In this work-in-progress,\nwe present an exploratory empirical study on membership inference\nvulnerabilities in clinical LLMs, focusing on whether adversaries can infer if\nspecific patient records were used during model training. Using a\nstate-of-the-art clinical question-answering model, Llemr, we evaluate both\ncanonical loss-based attacks and a domain-motivated paraphrasing-based\nperturbation strategy that more realistically reflects clinical adversarial\nconditions. Our preliminary findings reveal limited but measurable membership\nleakage, suggesting that current clinical LLMs provide partial resistance yet\nremain susceptible to subtle privacy risks that could undermine trust in\nclinical AI adoption.

    "summary": "The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in\nsolving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to\ngeneral LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains\nunexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in\nreal-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on\ncomparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal\nthat there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)\nsignificant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive\nrunning time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether\nexisting inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main\ntakeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can\nimprove service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while\nprefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving\nperformance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world\nworkload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings.

Our extensive experiments show that\nVIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels.\nFurthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of\ncompositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents.

    "summary": "Causal structure learning (CSL), a prominent technique for encoding\ncause-and-effect relationships among variables, through Bayesian Networks\n(BNs). Although recovering causal structure solely from data is a challenge,\nthe integration of prior knowledge, revealing partial structural truth, can\nmarkedly enhance learning quality. However, current methods based on prior\nknowledge exhibit limited resilience to errors in the prior, with hard\nconstraint methods disregarding priors entirely, and soft constraints accepting\npriors based on a predetermined confidence level, which may require expert\nintervention. To address this issue, we propose a strategy resilient to\nedge-level prior errors for CSL, thereby minimizing human intervention. We\nclassify prior errors into different types and provide their theoretical impact\non the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) under the presumption of sufficient\ndata. Intriguingly, we discover and prove that the strong hazard of prior\nerrors is associated with a unique acyclic closed structure, defined as\n``quasi-circle''. Leveraging this insight, a post-hoc strategy is employed to\nidentify the prior errors by its impact on the increment of ``quasi-circles''.\nThrough empirical evaluation on both real and synthetic datasets, we\ndemonstrate our strategy's robustness against prior errors.

However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon\ntasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond\nto complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of\nLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to\nstimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.\nBased on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising\ncomplex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long\nreasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the\nR-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer\nsignificant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit\nlimited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget\nacross multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use\nR-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning\nwith verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,\nRLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the\nmulti-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning\ntasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024.

    "summary": "AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains\nwhere object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time\n(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,\na representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled\nsamples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),\nsupporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on\nin-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist\nmodels while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models\nare tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental\nclassification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,\nevolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:\ntime-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental\nclassifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving\ntemporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that\nleverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.\nCaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained\nvisual recognition and generation.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their\nremarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular\nfocuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less\nattention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding\ncapabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment\nbetween visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have\napplied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring\nexpression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either\nreferring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these\nfine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly\ncomprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our\nmodel distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception\nwith general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel\nprocesses visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs\nsubsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during\ninference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The\neffectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a\ndiverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and\nobject-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that\njointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also\ndesigned to verify the flexibility of our method.",

    "summary": "Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,\nparticularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model\nreduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network\nand vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we\ndemonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in\nmodel size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for\nfine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the\nbest trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.",

Collecting\nsufficiently large datasets for offline RL is exhausting since this data\ncollection requires colossus interactions with environments and becomes tricky\nwhen the interaction with the environment is restricted. Hence, how an agent\nlearns the best policy with a minimal static dataset is a crucial issue in\noffline RL, similar to the sample efficiency problem in online RL. In this\npaper, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play pretraining method to\ninitialize a feature of a Q-network to enhance data efficiency in offline RL.\nSpecifically, we introduce a shared Q-network structure that outputs\npredictions of the next state and Q-value.

Through extensive\nexperiments, we empirically demonstrate that our method enhances the\nperformance of existing popular offline RL methods on the D4RL, Robomimic and\nV-D4RL benchmarks.

    "summary": "Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved\nremarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D\nspatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.\nPrevious reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological\ncognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues.

To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that\ncan effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images\nwhile reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D\nmentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on\nexplicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of\ntwo stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent\ngenerated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,\nVGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on\noutcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive\nexperiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently\noutperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D\nrepresentations into multimodal reasoning.

Here, we propose\nYODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a 2.5D diffusion-based framework for\nmedical image translation (MIT). Consistent with DM theory, we find that\nconventional diffusion sampling stochastically replicates noise. To mitigate\nthis, we draw and average multiple samples, akin to physical signal averaging.\nAs this effectively approximates the DM's expected value, we term this\nExpectation-Approximation (ExpA) sampling. We additionally propose regression\nsampling YODA, which retains the initial DM prediction and omits iterative\nrefinement to produce noise-free images in a single step. Across five diverse\nmulti-modal datasets - including multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT -\nwe demonstrate that regression sampling is not only substantially more\nefficient but also matches or exceeds image quality of full diffusion sampling\neven with ExpA. Our results reveal that iterative refinement solely enhances\nperceptual realism without benefiting information translation, which we confirm\nin relevant downstream tasks. YODA outperforms eight state-of-the-art DMs and\nGANs and challenges the presumed superiority of DMs and GANs over\ncomputationally cheap regression models for high-quality MIT.

Diverging from most\nexisting benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models\nto solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained\nfrom previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics\nto evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We\nextensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance\nprofiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial\nperformance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to\nbenefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we\ninvestigate model performance under two learning settings and find that\ninstance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model\nlearning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static\nabilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all\ntasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model\nperformance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for\nassessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human\ncapabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation\napproaches.

    "summary": "Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in\nNLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which\ncontain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to\npatent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or\ndomain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain\n3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT\narchitecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our\napproach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention,\nrotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four\ndownstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT,\nconsistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out\nof four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline\nPatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and\nMosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the\ntokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all\nModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of\nPatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications.\nThese results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and\narchitectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.",

    "summary": "Identifying DNA- (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is crucial for the\nunderstanding of cell function, molecular interactions as well as regulatory\nfunctions. Owing to their high similarity, most of the existing approaches face\nchallenges in differentiating between DBPs and RBPs leading to high\ncross-prediction errors. Moreover, identifying proteins which bind to both DNA\nand RNA (DRBPs) is also quite a challenging task. In this regard, we propose a\nnovel framework viz. LAMP-PRo which is based on pre-trained protein language\nmodel (PLM), attention mechanisms and multi-label learning to mitigate these\nissues. First, pre-trained PLM such ESM-2 is used for embedding the protein\nsequences followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Subsequently\nmulti-head self-attention mechanism is applied for the contextual information\nwhile label-aware attention is used to compute class-specific representations\nby attending to the sequence in a way that is tailored to each label (DBP, RBP\nand non-NABP) in a multi-label setup. We have also included a novel cross-label\nattention mechanism to explicitly capture dependencies between DNA- and\nRNA-binding proteins, enabling more accurate prediction of DRBP. Finally, a\nlinear layer followed by a sigmoid function are used for the final prediction.\nExtensive experiments are carried out to compare LAMP-PRo with the existing\nmethods wherein the proposed model shows consistent competent performance.\nFurthermore, we also provide visualization to showcase model interpretability,\nhighlighting which parts of the sequence are most relevant for a predicted\nlabel.

Current evaluations are fragmented,\nbased on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable\nresults. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale,\nstandardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By\nunifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to\neconomic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the\nnecessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM\nsimulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have\nlimited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly\nwith model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased\ninference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off:\ninstruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions\nbut degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle\nwhen simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that\nsimulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive\nreasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939).

One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient\nrepresentations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them in\nstate-action transitions. Whereas such representations are procedurally\nefficient, they lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose\nto enhance the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of\ntrajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally\nEnriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and\ntheir transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects,\ninteractions, and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing\na detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional\nabstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally\nEnriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous\ngraph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential\nfor generalisation. We demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks,\nenabling agents to recognise task relevant structural patterns across CREATE\nand MiniGrid environments.

To overcome the scarcity of attack data, it generates\nadversarial trajectories simulating diverse threats, ensuring robust training.\nExperiments on MAS benchmarks show SentinelNet achieves near-perfect detection\nof malicious agents, close to 100% within two debate rounds, and recovers 95%\nof system accuracy from compromised baselines.

    "summary": "The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is\nharder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify\nthe correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets\nwith ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect\nproposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the\nbelief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to\nsubjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior\nbeliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred\nposition, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict\nwith their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt\nsycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to\nmaximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We\nimplemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to\nevaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were\nmore persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions\nconsistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main\nfindings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the\njudge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces\nsignificant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when\ndefending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,\narguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise\ncomparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality\ntraining signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing\nimportant aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in\nlanguage models.",

To\nunderstand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking\nthe token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our\nanalysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1\ncandidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of\nother candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with\nworse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K\nOptimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration\nissue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical\nmanner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the\ntop-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger\npenalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is\nparticularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens\nwith high entropy.

To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of\nproblems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling\nbudgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models\noutperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms\nthem when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been\ninterpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We\nargue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric\noutputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success\nin the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can\ntherefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of\nproblems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of\ncompletions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an\nexplicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade\nrapidly as tau increases.

    "summary": "The paradigm of LLM-as-a-judge is emerging as a scalable and efficient\nalternative to human evaluation, demonstrating strong performance on\nwell-defined tasks. However, its reliability in open-ended tasks with dynamic\nenvironments and complex interactions remains unexplored. To bridge the gap, we\nintroduce WebDevJudge, a systematic benchmark for assessing LLM-as-a-judge\nperformance in web development, with support for both non-interactive\nevaluation based on static observations and continuous interactive evaluation\nwith a dynamic web environment. WebDevJudge comprises human preference labels\nover paired web implementations, annotated with structured and query-grounded\nrubrics to ensure high-quality ground truth. Using this benchmark, we\ncomprehensively evaluate various evaluators, including LLMs, MLLMs, and agentic\nworkflows. We systematically investigate the impact of different paradigms and\nguidance mechanisms. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between LLM\njudges and human experts. In-depth analysis indicates this gap stems from\nfundamental model limitations, including failures in recognizing functional\nequivalence, verifying task feasibility, and mitigating bias. Overall,\nWebDevJudge presents a significant challenge to LLM-as-a-judge, offering\ninsights to guide future research toward developing more reliable and capable\nautomated evaluators for complicated scenarios.

    "summary": "In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of\nalignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model\nto improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety,\ninstruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on\nmemorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction\nthrough string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for\nour specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model\ncan identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such\nas edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,\napproximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative\nestimate of $10\\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial\nartifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily\nregurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or\nRL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a\nmeaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a\npossibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work\nopens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation\npractices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,\ndistillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's\noriginal dataset.",

    "summary": "A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic\nstructures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead\nof learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the\noptimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach\ndevises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the\nmethod predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a\nsurrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation\nmethod. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping\nbetween the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space\ndetermined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the\nparametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional\nrepresentation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an\neducated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the\nintermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing\nequations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential\nerrors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the\ndesign in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics.\nDifferent architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation\ncapabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The\nquasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by\nreducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\\%$ while\nachieving discrepancies below $4\\%$ in the optimal value of the objective\nfunctional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to\nextrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.",

Embodied agents\nequipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation\nmaps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily\nrely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small\nLLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to\nlimited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which\nprevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt\nintroduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency\non local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device\nefficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better\nunderstand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to\nprune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we\npropose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to\nefficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on\nHM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time\nlatency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner.

While many natural language understanding\nchallenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the\nrobust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs), numerous practical applications - such as semantic matching,\nclustering, and information retrieval - continue to rely on text embeddings for\ntheir efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, integrating LLMs with text\nembeddings has become a major research focus in recent years. In this survey,\nwe categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three\noverarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional\nembedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, adapting their innate\ncapabilities for high-quality embedding; and (3) Text embedding understanding\nwith LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing\nrecent works based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream\napplications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from\nvarious research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we\nhighlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with\npre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought\nforth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for\nthe evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical\nopportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.",

In this paper, we investigate the security\nimplications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,\nwe show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our\nkey insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose\ntrigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this\nunderestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new\nbackdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of\ntransferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor\ntrigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in\nanticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains\nstealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens\nprovides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using\nT-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable\nbackdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and\nacross four model families of LLMs.",

Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on\ninstruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,\nhow far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we\nintroduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across\neight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for\nmost of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc.). We\nfurther propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses\nVLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.\nBeyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics\nfrom videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K.

In psychological and social value theories such\nas Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple\nvalue dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods\nencounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:\n1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,\nignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)\nthey struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those\nunderrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we\npropose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE\nalignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex\ninterdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal\nrelationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it\napplies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired\nvalue objectives.

    "title": "From Unaligned to Aligned: Scaling Multilingual LLMs with Multi-Way\n  Parallel Corpora",
    "summary": "Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data\nhave proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to\nlow-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its\nability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way\nparallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages,\nprovides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for\nimproving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale,\nhigh-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus\nspans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring\nextensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best\npractices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including\nstrategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of\nkey influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that\nmodels trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained\non unaligned multilingual data.",

While effective in\nmany settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are\ngiven, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address\nthis issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling\nthe specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions.

We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark\nderived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies:\nmultimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information\nseeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two\nregimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive\nonly screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with\nno semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents\ncan be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional\ntextualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice,\nStarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when\nagents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice\naffects subsequent performance.

These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to\nfulfill specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice\nleads to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt\nLLMs to new scenarios with few training data is a major challenge for current\ncode generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named\nDEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for\ncode generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning\nopportunities, using error revision to overcome their own shortcomings, thus\nachieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED involves identifying error\ncode generated by LLMs, employing Self-Revise for code revision, optimizing the\nmodel with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous\nimprovement. Experimental results show that, compared to other mainstream\nfine-tuning approaches, DEED achieves superior performance with few training\ndata, showing an average relative improvement of 46.2% in Pass@1 on multiple\ncode generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-Revise,\nwhich generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared\nto the code samples from datasets. Moreover, DEED consistently demonstrates\nstrong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its applicability.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data\nanalytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating\nmulti-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics\nframeworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering\nlittle to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables\nprivacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks\nsupport for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable\nqueries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates\nLLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical\nmulti-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms\nthem into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first\ndecomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps\neach subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior\nstructural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent\nrewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and\nminimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by\nachieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive\nFA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical\nfoundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural\nlanguage input in the FA setting.",

Building on recent advancements in\ncausal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as\nfollows. For the former, we consider agent-specific effects -- a causal concept\nthat quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates\nthrough a subset of agents.

This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.\nSpecifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers\ninto pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain\nparameters efficiency.

To mitigate potential\nperformance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set\nof adjustment parameters for each layer.

Yet current agents remain limited by shallow\nretrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce\nPokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified\nreinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability.\nPokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from\nAI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward\nsignals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction\nadherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further\nenhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool\nfailures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents.

    "summary": "Modern AI relies on huge matrix multiplications (MatMuls), whose computation\nposes a scalability problem for inference and training. We propose an\nalternative, GPU native bilinear operator to MatMuls in neural networks, which\noffers a three-way tradeoff between: speed, accuracy and parameter count. In\nparticular, this operator requires substantially fewer FLOPs to evaluate ($\\ll\nn^3$), yet increases the parameter count compared to MatMul ($\\gg n^2$). We\ncall this operator Strassen-Tile (STL). The key idea behind STL is a local\nlearnable change-of-basis, applied on tiles of the weight and activation\nmatrices, followed by an element-wise product between the tiles, implemented\nsimultaneously via MatMul. The key technical question we study is how to\noptimize the change-of-basis of a given layer, which is a highly non-convex\nproblem. We show that theory-backed initializations (inspired by fast matrix\nand polynomial multiplication) lead to substantially better accuracy than\nrandom SGD initialization. This phenomenon motivates further algorithmic study\nof STL optimization in DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate that STL can\napproximate 4x4 MatMul of tiles while reducing FLOPs by a factor of 2.66, and\ncan improve Imagenet-1K accuracy of SoTA T2T-ViT-7 (4.3M parameters) while\nlowering FLOPs. Even with non-CUDA optimized PyTorch code, STL achieves\nwall-clock speedups in the compute-bound regime. These results, together with\nits theoretical grounds, suggest STL as a promising building block for scalable\nand cost-efficient AI.",

    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive\napplications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring\nthe trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective\nconformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by\nconstructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct\nanswers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers\nfor all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA\nscenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we\nintroduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware\nsampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out\ncalibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling\ncap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,\nthe maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level\ncannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated\nsampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ\ncalibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated\nbudget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically\nvalid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the\ncandidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an\nadditional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby\ncontrolling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show\nthat SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and\ncalibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data\nefficiency.",

The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static\nset of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While\nreinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse\nrewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with\ninefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these\ndistinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically\ncombines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation,\nMENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through\nexploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a\nteacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided\nreward that provides fine-grained guidance.

These\nmethods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,\n(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned\nmodel. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by\nassigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with\nthe highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp\nlocal minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask\nselection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome\nthis issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed\nScore-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we\nintroduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates\nduring the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the\ncorresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,\nmodels, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes\nsharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately\nimproving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.",

    "summary": "Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively\nusing reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing\napproaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:\ntoken-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide fine-grained advantage signals\nbut suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training an\naccurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,\nGRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,\nleading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we\npropose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages\nsegment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a\nbetter balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level\nmethods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods,\nenabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a\ncritic model.

We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain\nfor short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and\nchain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point\nimprovements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT,\nfeaturing novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces\nthe cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements\nover GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code\npublicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.",

    "summary": "We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program\nsynthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While\nprior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language\ndescriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from\ntraining examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in\nreal-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve\nvarious edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves\nrobustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis\nclass defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for\nselected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs\nare chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries\nrequired. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC,\nand programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We\nrelease our code at https://github.com/klee972/SYNTRA.",

    "summary": "State-of-the-art perceptive Reinforcement Learning controllers for legged\nrobots either (i) impose oscillator or IK-based gait priors that constrain the\naction space, add bias to the policy optimization and reduce adaptability\nacross robot morphologies, or (ii) operate \"blind\", which struggle to\nanticipate hind-leg terrain, and are brittle to noise. In this paper, we\npropose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL\napproach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely\nthrough reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning\ncompared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase\nas a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap\nstatistics and adds a swing- phase contact penalty, while the policy acts\ndirectly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in\nMuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and\ndomain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances\n(median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with\ncomparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x\nfaster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2\nusing a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report\npreliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters.

    "summary": "Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing\nresearch interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection\nacross multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models\nfor distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources.\nUnder the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have\nbrought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they\ndirectly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors\nbetween normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to\ndistinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified\nfeature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations\nto address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we\ndesign a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features\ninto a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to\nprevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling\ncapability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a\nglobal perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.\nExtensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection\nbenchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)\nand one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a\nremarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four\ndatasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across\ndifferent scenarios.",

    "summary": "We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for\nsemi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow\nmatching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields\nbetween probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to\ndiffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly\napplying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea\n-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the\nframework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed\ntarget (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key\nadvantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the\nneed for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;\n(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which\nquantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward\npass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models\nsuch as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy\nbut heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as\nthe learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly\nscore inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is\nLipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical\nguarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench\nbenchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy\nand inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on\nhigh-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training\nparadigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language\nmodel (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training\ninefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where\nmost advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where\nthe proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over\ntime. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term\nlearning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple\nyet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically\nrestructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)\nPairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with\nlarge advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based\nTrajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through\ninformed batch reshuffling.

    "summary": "Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven\neffective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and\ntime-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile\nmanipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two\nhigh-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have\naddressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations\nin simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key\nchallenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2)\npositioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor\npolicies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data\ngeneration as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints\n(e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during\nnavigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a\nprincipled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four\nmulti-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates\nsignificantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this\ndiversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a\nsingle source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few\nas 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic\nhardware.

In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous\ndiscovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis,\na novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and\nStrategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the\ngenetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates\nthe target web agent's responses to provide feedback.

    "title": "Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and\n  Cooperative Completion",
    "summary": "Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some\nsamples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering\nmethods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely\non static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal\nfusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this\npaper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on\nHierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC\nachieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design.\nIn the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing\nmutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive\nview weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity\nbetween individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by\nweighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally,\nHSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent\nrepresentations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes\nreconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of\ncompletion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.\nAblation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and\ndynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's\nrobustness to hyperparameter variations.",

    "summary": "Monitoring AIs at runtime can help us detect and stop harmful actions. In\nthis paper, we study how to efficiently combine multiple runtime monitors into\na single monitoring protocol. The protocol's objective is to maximize the\nprobability of applying a safety intervention on misaligned outputs (i.e.,\nmaximize recall). Since running monitors and applying safety interventions are\ncostly, the protocol also needs to adhere to an average-case budget constraint.\nTaking the monitors' performance and cost as given, we develop an algorithm to\nfind the best protocol. The algorithm exhaustively searches over when and which\nmonitors to call, and allocates safety interventions based on the\nNeyman-Pearson lemma. By focusing on likelihood ratios and strategically\ntrading off spending on monitors against spending on interventions, we more\nthan double our recall rate compared to a naive baseline in a code review\nsetting. We also show that combining two monitors can Pareto dominate using\neither monitor alone.

    "summary": "Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific\nknowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)\nwith external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge\nstored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two\ncategories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning\non externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG),\nwhich depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual\ndocuments. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while\nGAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to\nunconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine\nanswer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified\nretrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external\nand parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules:\nKnowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to\nproduce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by\nretrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively\nselects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form\nconcise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments\non five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5%\nimprovement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the\neffectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive\nreasoning.

    "summary": "Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which\nstrengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external\ntools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage\ntools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally\ndifferent training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency\non simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In\nthis work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A$^2$FM), a unified\nframework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first learns\ntask-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a shared\nbackbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third\nmode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary\nreasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To\njointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy\nOptimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a\ncost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A$^2$FM achieves 13.4% on\nBrowseComp, 70.4% on AIME25, and 16.7% on HLE, setting new SOTA among\ncomparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across\nagentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks.

    "summary": "Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the\nlatent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues\nwith limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed\nhuman mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance\nimprovement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using\nattention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these\nissues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent\ninformation and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the\nnetwork fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local\n(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components\nof image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent\nfrequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent\ninformation. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain\nfeatures collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,\nwith the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction\nlearning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing\nthe pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction\nmethods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through\ndimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces\ncomputational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive\nexperimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority\ncompared to the most state-of-the-art.",

Despite its widespread\nempirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its impact on\nlearning performance remains notably absent, even in the simplest linear\nregression setting. We present the first systematic theoretical study of this\nfundamental question, analyzing finite-step stochastic gradient descent (SGD)\nfor high-dimensional linear regression under a comprehensive range of\nquantization targets: data, labels, parameters, activations, and gradients. Our\nnovel analytical framework establishes precise algorithm-dependent and\ndata-dependent excess risk bounds that characterize how different quantization\naffects learning: parameter, activation, and gradient quantization amplify\nnoise during training; data quantization distorts the data spectrum; and data\nand label quantization introduce additional approximation and quantized error.\nCrucially, we prove that for multiplicative quantization (with input-dependent\nquantization step), this spectral distortion can be eliminated, and for\nadditive quantization (with constant quantization step), a beneficial scaling\neffect with batch size emerges. Furthermore, for common polynomial-decay data\nspectra, we quantitatively compare the risks of multiplicative and additive\nquantization, drawing a parallel to the comparison between FP and integer\nquantization methods.

Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been\nproved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets\n(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space\noptimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior\ninformation to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information\nrespectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.\nThen, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human\nmesh.

We\ntherefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is\nopen-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce\nvalid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.\nFirst-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean\n$\\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\\approx$ 1).\nCrucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of\nconstraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production\nof a valid item rather than error detection and principled,\nconstraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection\ndeteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning'\nshow no advantage.

While synthetic data augmentation techniques such as SMOTE and\nADASYN have been proposed to address this issue, the optimal augmentation ratio\nremains unclear, with practitioners often defaulting to full balancing (1:1\nratio) without empirical justification.\n  This study systematically evaluates 10 data augmentation scenarios using the\nGive Me Some Credit dataset (97,243 observations, 7% default rate), comparing\nSMOTE, BorderlineSMOTE, and ADASYN at different multiplication factors (1x, 2x,\n3x). All models were trained using XGBoost and evaluated on a held-out test set\nof 29,173 real observations. Statistical significance was assessed using\nbootstrap testing with 1,000 iterations.\n  Key findings reveal that ADASYN with 1x multiplication (doubling the minority\nclass) achieved optimal performance with AUC of 0.6778 and Gini coefficient of\n0.3557, representing statistically significant improvements of +0.77% and\n+3.00% respectively (p = 0.017, bootstrap test). Higher multiplication factors\n(2x and 3x) resulted in performance degradation, with 3x showing a -0.48%\ndecrease in AUC, suggesting a \"law of diminishing returns\" for synthetic\noversampling. The optimal class imbalance ratio was found to be 6.6:1\n(majority:minority), contradicting the common practice of balancing to 1:1.\n  This work provides the first empirical evidence of an optimal \"sweet spot\"\nfor data augmentation in credit scoring, with practical guidelines for industry\npractitioners and researchers working with imbalanced datasets. While\ndemonstrated on a single representative dataset, the methodology provides a\nreproducible framework for determining optimal augmentation ratios in other\nimbalanced domains.",

We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural\ninformation with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of\nLLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.\nWe propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first\nleverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural\ninformation into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction\nalgorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)\nthat needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format\ncomprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR.

    "summary": "Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for adapting pre-trained\nlanguage models to downstream tasks are susceptible to interference from noisy\ndata. Conventional noise-handling approaches either rely on laborious data\npre-processing or employ model architecture modifications prone to error\naccumulation. In contrast to existing noise-process paradigms, we propose a\nnoise-robust adaptation method via asymmetric LoRA poisoning experts (LoPE), a\nnovel framework that enhances model robustness to noise only with generated\nnoisy data. Drawing inspiration from the mixture-of-experts architecture, LoPE\nstrategically integrates a dedicated poisoning expert in an asymmetric LoRA\nconfiguration. Through a two-stage paradigm, LoPE performs noise injection on\nthe poisoning expert during fine-tuning to enhance its noise discrimination and\nprocessing ability. During inference, we selectively mask the dedicated\npoisoning expert to leverage purified knowledge acquired by normal experts for\nnoise-robust output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoPE achieves\nstrong performance and robustness purely through the low-cost noise injection,\nwhich completely eliminates the requirement of data cleaning.",

While effective\nfor high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited\ntraining efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision\ntasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack\nof clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis\nconfirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and\nunderstanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent\ndiffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent\ndiffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages\nself-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature\nspace with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,\nwhile a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for\nhigh-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this\nsemantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As\na result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step\nsampling, and improves generative quality.

Recently, reasoning LLMs have\nbeen proposed to improve the \\textit{reasoning} or \\textit{thinking}\ncapabilities of LLMs to solve complex problems.

In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{G}uided\n\\textbf{P}ivotal \\textbf{O}ptimization (GPO), a novel fine-tuning strategy that\ndives into the reasoning process to enable more effective improvements. GPO\nfirst identifies the `critical step' within a reasoning trajectory - a point\nthat the model must carefully proceed to succeed at the problem.

This focus allows the model to learn more\neffectively from pivotal moments within the reasoning process to improve the\nreasoning performance. We demonstrate that GPO is a general strategy that can\nbe integrated with various optimization methods to improve reasoning\nperformance.

    "summary": "We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on\nhuman-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled\nexperiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of\nscalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent\ntask data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform\nrigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM\nwith the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task\ndata-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic\ncapabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \\textbf{Agentic\nSelf-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning\nframework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within\na shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,\na Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of\nharder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,\nASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines\n(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under\nzero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and\nrobustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main\nbottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual\nGRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small\nlate-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.\nThis work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for\nopen-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role\nco-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

Prior work has\nattempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis\nof its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In\nthis work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM)\nbetween pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental\nproperties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance\nbound on identical state spaces.

For example, we find\nthat instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline\ncontent from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of\nunder-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to\n53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text\nunderstanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical\ntest bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language\nsafety.",

    "summary": "The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\nobscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This\npaper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as\nmatching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To\noperationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory,\nthe most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects\ngeneral intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning,\nmemory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to\nevaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly \"jagged\"\ncognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in\nknowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in\nfoundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The\nresulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify\nboth rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.",

We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that\nprocesses the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through\ncross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic\nbenchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a\nlong-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an\naccuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D\ntime-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.

Sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features\nthat often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and\npassive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To\naddress this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds\nexplicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three\nstages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept\nrepresentations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a\ndictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects\nactivating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical\nreasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order\nstructures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on\nmulti-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept\ncues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),\nand context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales\nrobustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and\ncontext-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones.

The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to\nmeasure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries.

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)-based post-training of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to improve accuracy on reasoning\ntasks and continues to attract significant attention. Existing RLVR methods,\nhowever, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for\ntoken-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on\nfinal answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL\npost-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our\ninvestigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which\nare not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup\nusing the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We\nintroduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture\nthe consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We\ndistinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former\nimplies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of\nerrors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence\nwith the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the\nRL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without\nnecessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial\ndistinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee\nfinal answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL\nmust be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence,\nwhich may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.",

    "summary": "Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions,\nyet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot\ntool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to\nmeasure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal\nshifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation\nthrough four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness,\nTool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for\nwasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency.\nAgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each\ndesigned to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this\nsetup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured\nby traditional $\\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\\%$\nrecovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\\%$, and\nretail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above\n$80\\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high\nraw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit\nmeasurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench\nestablishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent\nresilience in realistic enterprise settings.",

    "summary": "Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising\nalternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent\nadvantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However,\nthe performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger\nstructural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off\nbetween inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the\ncode generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads\nto a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce\nefficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced\nRemasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to\nachieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.\nSpecifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation\nprocess: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is\nestablished; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated\ntokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks\nshow that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over\nmainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%\ninference speedup.

From\nidentifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting\nprocesses, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and\nsustainability.

By training a\ncompact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across\ndifferent farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead.\nExperimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the\nperformance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead.

Using an experimentally calibrated\ndevice-circuit-algorithm co-simulation framework, we demonstrate that networks\nincorporating our dendritic neurons achieve superior performance in comparison\nto much larger networks without dendrites ($\\sim$17$\\times$ fewer trainable\nweight parameters).

Most current\nevaluations and benchmarks reward models' correct standalone answers--but\ncorrectness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. In this\nwork, we explore a different perspective: reasoning is not a static chain of\nsteps, but a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into\ndeeper insights. To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established\nphilosophical tradition: \\textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through\nthesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a\nstructured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics.\nUnlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model\nreaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate\ndistinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers\nsignificant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated\nbenchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses\nover 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM.

    "title": "Latent Discrete Diffusion Models",
    "summary": "We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus\non a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically\nfactorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade\nquality in few-step generation. We propose \\emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion\nModels} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a\ncontinuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a\nsofter signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve\nambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully\njoint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially\nresolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both\nvariants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn\ninformative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs\nyield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to\nstate-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at\nlower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.",

    "summary": "Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant\nplanetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However,\nthe deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent\nsim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions\nwith granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for\ndeveloping and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking\non such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to\ntrain reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally\ngenerated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then\ntransferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue\nfacility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement\nlearning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective\ncombinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical\nevidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior\nzero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also\nanalyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics,\nwhich offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational\ncost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating\nreliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a substantial step towards\ndeploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.",

Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise\ninterventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while\npreserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related\nquestions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks.

This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate\nshallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation\ndepths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an\neffective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based\non our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header\ntokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens\npossess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens\nmid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals\nat any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,\nGemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety\nperformance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It\nsecures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill\nattacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces\nthe average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,\nAutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving\nutility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this\nresilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning\n(benign or adversarial).",

While classical RL algorithms aim at\nmaximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,\nresource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require\nstrategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed\nprobability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which\nthe objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds\na prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be\nreformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,\nthereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need\nfor entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the\nequivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be\nderived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or\nDueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we\nconsider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the\nexpected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the\ndestination within a given time budget.

We formulate a structured\nframework to organize the field, based on a survey of foundational datasets and\nbenchmarks and a taxonomy of evaluation methodologies, which together\nsystematically document the evolution from pre-LLM to post-LLM approaches.\nBeyond taxonomical organization, we identify fundamental limitations in current\napproaches and their implications for real-world deployment. To guide future\nresearch, we delineate key challenges and propose strategic directions,\nincluding enhanced interpretability mechanisms and integration of\napplication-specific evaluation criteria, ultimately providing a roadmap for\ndeveloping more robust and practical hallucination evaluation systems.",

    "summary": "Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as\none-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images\nusing a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is\npermutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on\narchitectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce\nsensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects\nmodel performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major\nor Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we\npropose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch\norderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the\ncompressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over\npermutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This\napproach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space.\nREOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to\n3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.",

Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean\naverage precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC).\nStatistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and\npaired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89\nfor the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs.\n48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent).

Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,\nfast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation\nlearning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that\nbehaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic\npolicies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during\ninference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In\ncontrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and\nnaturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics\nand reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We\npropose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized\nautoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide\ndecentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL\ndivergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while\npreserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our\nmethod achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while\nbeing up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than\nlarge generative models.

Under this view,\none can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream\ntasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as\n(i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream\ntasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the\nvariance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the\ndefined Task Priors?

Prior jailbreak\nresearch has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment\noften unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online\nHarassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn\nharassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)\nsimulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods\nattacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a\nmixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,\nLLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our\nresults show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an\nattack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,\nand 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal\nrate to 1-2% in both models.

Qualitative evaluation further\nreveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as\nMachiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies\nwith memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit\ndistinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models\nshowing significant vulnerability.

A key limitation of these models is their inability\nto readily integrate available partial observations and additional priors. In\ncontrast, energy-based models (EBMs) address this by incorporating\ncorresponding scalar energy terms. Here, we propose Energy Matching, a\nframework that endows flow-based approaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far\nfrom the data manifold, samples move from noise to data along irrotational,\noptimal transport paths. As they approach the data manifold, an entropic energy\nterm guides the system into a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly\ncapturing the underlying likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize\nthese dynamics with a single time-independent scalar field, which serves as\nboth a powerful generator and a flexible prior for effective regularization of\ninverse problems. The present method substantially outperforms existing EBMs on\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in terms of fidelity, while retaining\nsimulation-free training of transport-based approaches away from the data\nmanifold. Furthermore, we leverage the flexibility of the method to introduce\nan interaction energy that supports the exploration of diverse modes, which we\ndemonstrate in a controlled protein generation setting. This approach learns a\nscalar potential energy, without time conditioning, auxiliary generators, or\nadditional networks, marking a significant departure from recent EBM methods.\nWe believe this simplified yet rigorous formulation significantly advances EBMs\ncapabilities and paves the way for their wider adoption in generative modeling\nin diverse domains.",

Existing\nneural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located\ninput-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in\nreal-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical\nmanifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator\nNetwork (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable\nfunctional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring\nhigh-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron\nmeasurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond\nshared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and\ntarget manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without\niterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator\nlearning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23\nyears of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with\nmillisecond inference latency.

    "summary": "Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of\nrare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting\napproaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary\nmodels, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis\nwith Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that\nachieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from\ninput images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:\nstructured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our\napproach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis\nacross four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and\nEnvironment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world\ndriving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More\nimportantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned\n7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%\naccuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at\nnear-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with\nhigh accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly\ndetection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic\nmonitoring for autonomous systems.",

Moreover,\nexisting evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only one web\ndocument adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely to\ncompetitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy from\nthe dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains, and number\nof actors.

Instead, traditional SEO strategies, those aiming to\nimprove the ranking of the source in the LLM context, are significantly more\neffective.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in\nmathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent\nsystems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM\nagents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or\nrely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but\nless dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems\nas graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the\nquality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is\ncrucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant\nrole. To address this, we propose $\\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement\nlearning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent\ncollaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback\nmechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the\ndebate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the\nagents. We assess $\\ours$ on various reasoning tasks, including mathematical\nreasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting.\nResults demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms single-agent\nprompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks on diverse tasks.",

    "summary": "Structured pruning is a practical approach to deploying large language models\n(LLMs) efficiently, as it yields compact, hardware-friendly architectures.\nHowever, the dominant local paradigm is task-agnostic: by optimizing layer-wise\nreconstruction rather than task objectives, it tends to preserve perplexity or\ngeneric zero-shot behavior but fails to capitalize on modest task-specific\ncalibration signals, often yielding limited downstream gains. We revisit global\nstructured pruning and present GISP-Global Iterative Structured Pruning-a\npost-training method that removes attention heads and MLP channels using\nfirst-order, loss-based important weights aggregated at the structure level\nwith block-wise normalization. An iterative schedule, rather than one-shot\npruning, stabilizes accuracy at higher sparsity and mitigates perplexity\ncollapse without requiring intermediate fine-tuning; the pruning trajectory\nalso forms nested subnetworks that support a \"prune-once, deploy-many\"\nworkflow. Furthermore, because importance is defined by a model-level loss,\nGISP naturally supports task-specific objectives; we instantiate perplexity for\nlanguage modeling and a margin-based objective for decision-style tasks.\nExtensive experiments show that across Llama2-7B/13B, Llama3-8B, and\nMistral-0.3-7B, GISP consistently lowers WikiText-2 perplexity and improves\ndownstream accuracy, with especially strong gains at 40-50% sparsity; on\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-3-8B with GSM8K, task-aligned calibration\nsubstantially boosts exact-match accuracy.",

To overcome this, we present DynaQuery - a unified, self-adapting\nframework that serves as a practical blueprint for next-generation \"Unbound\nDatabases.\" At the heart of DynaQuery lies the Schema Introspection and Linking\nEngine (SILE), a novel systems primitive that elevates schema linking to a\nfirst-class query planning phase. We conduct a rigorous, multi-benchmark\nempirical evaluation of this structure-aware architecture against the prevalent\nunstructured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. Our results\ndemonstrate that the unstructured retrieval paradigm is architecturally\nsusceptible to catastrophic contextual failures, such as SCHEMA_HALLUCINATION,\nleading to unreliable query generation. In contrast, our SILE-based design\nestablishes a substantially more robust foundation, nearly eliminating this\nfailure mode. Moreover, end-to-end validation on a complex, newly curated\nbenchmark uncovers a key generalization principle: the transition from pure\nschema-awareness to holistic semantics-awareness.

Current\nhallucination detectors, e.g., single-token linear probing (LP) and PTrue,\ntypically analyze only the logit of the first generated token or just its\nhighest-scoring component, overlooking richer signals embedded within earlier\ntoken distributions. We demonstrate that analyzing the complete sequence of\nearly logits potentially provides substantially more diagnostic information.

By analyzing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence between logits corresponding to hallucinated and non-hallucinated\ntokens, we underscore the importance of incorporating later-token logits to\nmore accurately capture the reliability dynamics of VLMs. In response, we\nintroduce Multi-Token Reliability Estimation (MTRE), a lightweight, white-box\nmethod that aggregates logits from the first ten tokens using multi-token\nlog-likelihood ratios and self-attention. Despite the challenges posed by large\nvocabulary sizes and long logit sequences, MTRE remains efficient and\ntractable.

Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25%\n(1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and\nBigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl).\nAdditionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve\nmodel ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero\nmean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers\nimprove efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether\ntheir newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, expected to\ndecompose goals, invoke tools, and verify results in dynamic environments.\nRealizing these capabilities requires access to agentic data- structured\ninteraction records that couple user intents with tool specifications,\nargument-grounded calls, and verifiable execution traces. However, collecting\nsuch data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to\nscale.\n  We present a unified framework for synthesizing agentic data using only LLMs,\nwithout any human-in-the-loop supervision. This framework decomposes generation\ninto modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records spanning task\nspecifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural language\nexchanges, and execution traces. Records conform to strict syntactic and\nsemantic constraints, ensuring machine-parseability and faithful alignment\nacross inputs, outputs, and tool calls.\n  Beyond single tasks, there is support for both multi-task and multi-turn\nagent interactions, enabling the construction of datasets that reflect the full\nspectrum of tool-use competencies. To ensure quality and consistency, the\nframework integrates constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation,\nand judge-based filtering.\n  This paper formalizes the schema for agentic records, details the prompt\ndesign principles that guide generation, and introduces scalable pipelines for\nhigh-quality synthetic data.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent LLMs (MALLMs) introduce\nnon-determinism unlike traditional or machine learning software, requiring new\napproaches to verifying correctness beyond simple output comparisons or\nstatistical accuracy over test datasets. This paper presents a taxonomy for LLM\ntest case design, informed by research literature and our experience. Each\nfacet is exemplified, and we conduct an LLM-assisted analysis of six\nopen-source testing frameworks, perform a sensitivity study of an agent-based\nsystem across different model configurations, and provide working examples\ncontrasting atomic and aggregated test cases. We identify key variation points\nthat impact test correctness and highlight open challenges that the research,\nindustry, and open-source communities must address as LLMs become integral to\nsoftware systems. Our taxonomy defines four facets of LLM test case design,\naddressing ambiguity in both inputs and outputs while establishing best\npractices. It distinguishes variability in goals, the system under test, and\ninputs, and introduces two key oracle types: atomic and aggregated. Our\nfindings reveal that current tools treat test executions as isolated events,\nlack explicit aggregation mechanisms, and inadequately capture variability\nacross model versions, configurations, and repeated runs. This highlights the\nneed for viewing correctness as a distribution of outcomes rather than a binary\nproperty, requiring closer collaboration between academia and practitioners to\nestablish mature, variability-aware testing methodologies.",

    "summary": "Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the\nrisk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as\ncatastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for\nmitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns\nof two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nreinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across\nLM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,\nand arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving\ncomparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this\ndifference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a\nmixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the\nother to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which\nstems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact\nwhen learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating\nthat the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in\npractical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL\nregularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our\nresults highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately\non-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully\non-policy data.",

    "summary": "The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their\ncapacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse\nscenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the\ncomputational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with\ndynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed\nsettings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and\nstep-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed\nmethodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training\nfor LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key\ncomponents: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,\nand hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to\nsynergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads\ninherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models\nwith extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by\ntraining Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K\ntokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite\nof downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A\nHaystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput\nwhile preserving model accuracy.

This approach substantially compresses textual\ninput while preserving semantic information, and we further design an\nLLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations\nfor balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining\naccuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context\nbenchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and\ndecoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme\ncompression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text\ntasks.

We further show that\nutility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment\nof safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement\nlearning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a\nnovel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe\nones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70%\nacross three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and\nmatches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses\nconfirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety\nand utility.",

    "summary": "The proliferation of misinformation necessitates scalable, automated\nfact-checking solutions. Yet, current benchmarks often overlook multilingual\nand topical diversity. This paper introduces a novel, dynamically extensible\ndata set that includes 61,514 claims in multiple languages and topics,\nextending existing datasets up to 2024. Through a comprehensive evaluation of\nfive prominent Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo,\nLLaMA 3.1, and Mixtral 8x7B, we identify significant performance gaps between\ndifferent languages and topics. While overall GPT-4o achieves the highest\naccuracy, it declines to classify 43% of claims. Across all models,\nfactual-sounding claims are misclassified more often than opinions, revealing a\nkey vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for caution and highlight\nchallenges in deploying LLM-based fact-checking systems at scale.",

    "summary": "Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons\nare arranged topographically according to their response properties, at\nmultiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning\nmodels lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces\nthat are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of\nself-attention that turns Transformers into \"Topoformers\" with topographic\norganization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are\narranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given\nkey - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected\nlayer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate\nthe feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment\nclassification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic\norganization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately\nencourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs.\nWe then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with\na masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant\nperforms on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet\nproduces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight\nlinguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain\nresponses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment\nbetween low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and\nhuman brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for\ngreater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the\norganization of linguistic information in the human brain.",

    "summary": "Fine-tuning is widely used to tailor large language models for specific tasks\nsuch as neural machine translation (NMT). However, leveraging transfer learning\nis computationally expensive when fine-tuning large multilingual models with\nbillions of parameters, thus creating a barrier to entry for researchers\nworking on low-resource domains such as Irish translation. Parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) bridges this gap by training on a fraction of the original\nmodel parameters, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach introducing\nsmall, trainable adapter layers. We introduce SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA as\nsemi-supervised inference-efficient approaches that strengthen domain\nadaptation and lead to improved overall performance in NMT. We demonstrate that\nSemiAdapt can outperform full-domain fine-tuning, while most notably, SemiLoRA\ncan propel PEFT methods to match or even outperform full-model fine-tuning.

    "summary": "Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large\nfoundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data\nscarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the\nreason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the\nembedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the\nmodels to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to\nprovide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on\ncode-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points\nwhere recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis\nemphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,\nwe leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to\nhighlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those\nlocations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context\nbias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby\nimproving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and\nChinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places\nmore correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.",

This paper introduces a\ntheoretical framework for LLM data markets, modeling the strategic interactions\nbetween buyers (LLM builders) and sellers (human annotators). We begin with\ntheoretical and empirical analysis showing how exploitative pricing drives\nhigh-quality sellers out of the market, degrading data quality and long-term\nmodel performance. Then we introduce fairshare, a pricing mechanism grounded in\ndata valuation that quantifies each data's contribution.

Theoretically, we show that fairshare yields mutually optimal\noutcomes: maximizing long-term buyer utility and seller profit while sustaining\nmarket participation. Empirically when training open-source LLMs on complex NLP\ntasks, including math problems, medical diagnosis, and physical reasoning,\nfairshare boosts seller earnings and ensures a stable supply of high-quality\ndata, while improving buyers' performance-per-dollar and long-term welfare.

However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:\npredicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert\nactivation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address\nthis gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the\ncomputational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural\nconfigurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the\nexpert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following\npredictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator\nwith a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified\nscaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its\nconfiguration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained\nLing-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active\nparameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an\nidentical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance\nof the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources,\nthereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws.

We use uncertainty to\nmeasure gender bias in MT systems. When the source sentence includes a lexeme\nwhose gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent\nrequires gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from\nthe context and can be susceptible to biases. Prior work measured bias via\ngender accuracy, however it cannot be applied to ambiguous cases. Using\nsemantic uncertainty, we are able to assess bias when translating both\nambiguous and unambiguous source sentences, and find that high translation\naccuracy does not correlate with exhibiting uncertainty appropriately, and that\ndebiasing affects the two cases differently.",

In\nthis paper, we introduce DCAD-2000 (Data Cleaning as Anomaly Detection), a\nlarge-scale multilingual corpus constructed from newly extracted Common Crawl\ndata and existing multilingual sources. DCAD-2000 covers 2,282 languages,\n46.72TB of text, and 8.63 billion documents, spanning 155 high- and\nmedium-resource languages and 159 writing scripts. To overcome the limitations\nof existing data cleaning approaches, which rely on manually designed heuristic\nthresholds, we reframe data cleaning as an anomaly detection problem. This\ndynamic filtering paradigm substantially improves data quality by automatically\nidentifying and removing noisy or anomalous content. By fine-tuning LLMs on\nDCAD-2000, we demonstrate notable improvements in data quality, robustness of\nthe cleaning pipeline, and downstream performance, particularly for\nlow-resource languages across multiple multilingual benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Large language models have become the latest trend in natural language\nprocessing, heavily featuring in the digital tools we use every day. However,\ntheir replies often reflect a narrow cultural viewpoint that overlooks the\ndiversity of global users. This missing capability could be referred to as\ncultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to\nrecognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its\noutput so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because\nculture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour,\ncultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is\nlimited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority\nperspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies\nstrongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging\nmoral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning\non survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation\nmethods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive\nreasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone\nensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning\nmust be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and\nlinguistic coherence. By clarifying the concept and outlining initial\ndirections for its assessment, a foundation is laid for future systems to be\nable to respond with greater sensitivity to the complex fabric of human\nculture.",

Therefore,\ncasting humor generation as a testbed, this work evaluates how funniness\noptimization in modern LLM pipelines couples with harmful content by jointly\nmeasuring humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity. This is further supplemented\nby analyzing incongruity signals through information-theoretic metrics. Across\nsix models, we observe that harmful outputs receive higher humor scores which\nfurther increase under role-based prompting, indicating a bias amplification\nloop between generators and evaluators. Information-theoretic analyses show\nharmful cues widen predictive uncertainty and surprisingly, can even make\nharmful punchlines more expected for some models, suggesting structural\nembedding in learned humor distributions. External validation on an additional\nsatire-generation task with human perceived funniness judgments shows that LLM\nsatire increases stereotypicality and typically toxicity, including for closed\nmodels. Quantitatively, stereotypical/toxic jokes gain $10-21\\%$ in mean humor\nscore, stereotypical jokes appear $11\\%$ to $28\\%$ more often among the jokes\nmarked funny by LLM-based metric and up to $10\\%$ more often in generations\nperceived as funny by humans.",

    "summary": "Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual\nevidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly\ncritical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise\ngrounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because\nthey map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without\nintermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that\nhallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual\ninput. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that\nquantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines\nfeature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is\nmasked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences\nbetween clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a\nsentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure\nof visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks\n(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our\nresults show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across\ndatasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond\nthese quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded\ntokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when\ncombined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it\nfurther improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights\nwhy gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together,\nour findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for\ndiagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust\nhallucination detection in multimodal generation.",

KoSimpleQA is designed to be challenging yet easy to grade,\nconsisting of 1,000 short, fact-seeking questions with unambiguous answers. We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of open-source LLMs of\nvarying sizes that support Korean, and find that even the strongest model\ngenerates correct answer only 33.7% of the time, underscoring the challenging\nnature of KoSimpleQA. Notably, performance rankings on KoSimpleQA differ\nsubstantially from those on the English SimpleQA, highlighting the unique value\nof our dataset. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning LLMs shows that engaging\nreasoning capabilities in the factual QA task can both help models better\nelicit their latent knowledge and improve their ability to abstain when\nuncertain.

    "summary": "In Bangladesh, many farmers continue to face challenges in accessing timely,\nexpert-level agricultural guidance. This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a\nvoice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for\nBengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural\nhandbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the\ncontent; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic\nretrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system\nto receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali\nquery, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma\n3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the\nanswer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced\nhigh-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop\nmanagement, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the\nKisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on\na 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual\nrichness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable\nrelevance and technical specificity. Semantic similarity analysis further\nrevealed a strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality,\nemphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses in curated\ndocumentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating\ncall-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and modern RAG\ntechniques to deliver expert-level agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi\nfarmers, paving the way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory\necosystem.",

    "summary": "Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) remains a long-standing\nchallenge in NLP, where models must learn from noisy bag-level annotations\nwhile making sentence-level predictions. While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA)\nDSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context\nlearning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key\nchallenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to\nnoisy annotation.\n  In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation\nExtraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k\ncandidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic\nexemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars\nfrom training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the\nfinal relation(s).\n  We further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource\nlanguages. Using available English DSRE training data, we evaluate all methods\non English as well as a newly curated benchmark covering four diverse\nlow-resource Indic languages -- Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, and Tulu. HYDRE\nachieves up to 20 F1 point gains in English and, on average, 17 F1 points on\nIndic languages over prior SoTA DSRE models. Detailed ablations exhibit HYDRE's\nefficacy compared to other prompting strategies.",

    "summary": "Despite progress in watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs),\nreal-world deployment remains limited. We argue that this gap stems from\nmisaligned incentives among LLM providers, platforms, and end users, which\nmanifest as four key barriers: competitive risk, detection-tool governance,\nrobustness concerns and attribution issues. We revisit three classes of\nwatermarking through this lens. \\emph{Model watermarking} naturally aligns with\nLLM provider interests, yet faces new challenges in open-source ecosystems.\n\\emph{LLM text watermarking} offers modest provider benefit when framed solely\nas an anti-misuse tool, but can gain traction in narrowly scoped settings such\nas dataset de-contamination or user-controlled provenance. \\emph{In-context\nwatermarking} (ICW) is tailored for trusted parties, such as conference\norganizers or educators, who embed hidden watermarking instructions into\ndocuments. If a dishonest reviewer or student submits this text to an LLM, the\noutput carries a detectable watermark indicating misuse. This setup aligns\nincentives: users experience no quality loss, trusted parties gain a detection\ntool, and LLM providers remain neutral by simply following watermark\ninstructions. We advocate for a broader exploration of incentive-aligned\nmethods, with ICW as an example, in domains where trusted parties need reliable\ntools to detect misuse. More broadly, we distill design principles for\nincentive-aligned, domain-specific watermarking and outline future research\ndirections. Our position is that the practical adoption of LLM watermarking\nrequires aligning stakeholder incentives in targeted application domains and\nfostering active community engagement.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are\ncomputationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce\nCompressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically\ncompresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training\napproach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token\nprediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction\nobjective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a\ncompression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a\nspecialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed\nembeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that\nleverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse\nreasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to:\ni) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially\nreducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at\ninference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive\nexperiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR\nachieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable\ncompression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8%\nperformance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied\nto more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR\ndemonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent\nreasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon\nacceptance.",

Concurrently, large language models\n(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the\nquestion of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this\npaper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We\nsystematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse\ncard games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,\nand examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while\nmastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the\nperformance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality\ndata, (2) LLMs can achieve a certain level of proficiency in multiple complex\ncard games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar\nrules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in\ngeneral capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be\nmitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data.

In this paper, we propose a new framework\nto assess the suitability of a similarity metric specifically for data curation\nin language model pretraining applications. Our framework's first evaluation\ncriterion captures how well distances reflect generalization in pretraining\nloss between different training examples. Next, we use each embedding model to\nguide a standard diversity-based data curation algorithm and measure its\nutility by pretraining a language model on the selected data and evaluating\ndownstream task performance. Finally, we evaluate the capabilities of\nembeddings to distinguish between examples from different data sources. With\nthese evaluations, we demonstrate that standard off-the-shelf embedding models\nare not well-suited for the pretraining data curation setting, underperforming\neven remarkably simple embeddings that are extracted from models trained on the\nsame pretraining corpus.

Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries,\naccess remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static\ndirectories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and\ngeographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague\nnutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as\ntime, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems\noptimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of\nfood-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified\navailability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most\nvulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital\nilliteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we\nintroduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for\nreal-time, context-aware free food retrieval.

    "title": "DrunkAgent: Stealthy Memory Corruption in LLM-Powered Recommender Agents",
    "summary": "Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used in\nrecommender systems (RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling, where the\nmemory mechanism plays a pivotal role in enabling the agents to autonomously\nexplore, learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, this very\nmechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack\nsurface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the\nrobustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely\nunderexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static\nembeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which are not designed for dynamic\nsystems, especially for dynamic memory states of LLM agents. This challenge is\nexacerbated by the black-box nature of commercial recommenders.\n  To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic\ninvestigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender\nagents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen\nsystem resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel\nblack-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically\nmeaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and\nintroduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting\nthe memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are\noptimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs,\nincluding collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential\nrecommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and\nstealthiness of DrunkAgent.",

    "summary": "We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of\nConstructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target\nphonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at\neach step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of\nsentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic\nmarkup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications\nof the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic\nfeature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using\nthe phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted\nfrom the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an\northography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or\nCyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the\nlanguage. The system can also translate further sentences into the target\nlanguage.\n  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for\ncreating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in\nexploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any\nparticular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and\nunderstand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly\nwide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different\nlinguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal\nwith more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore\nis the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into\nlow-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we\nprovide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could\nafford some real gains in such tasks.\n  https://github.com/SakanaAI/IASC",

Data-driven approaches often\nstruggle to transfer effectively to unseen tasks. While recent schema-based TOD\nframeworks improve generalization by decoupling task logic from language\nunderstanding, their reliance on neural or generative models often obscures how\ntask schemas influence behaviour and hence impair interpretability. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel framework, CoDial (Code for Dialogue), which\nconverts a TOD task schema, represented as a novel structured heterogeneous\ngraph, to programmatic LLM guardrailing code, such as NVIDIA's Colang, enabling\ninterpretable and efficient alignment of dialogue policies during inference. We\nintroduce two paradigms, $\\text{CoDial}_{\\text{free}}$ and\n$\\text{CoDial}_{\\text{structured}}$ for generating LLM guardrails, and propose\na feedback mechanism that integrates human feedback to iteratively improve the\ngenerated code. Empirically, CoDial achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance on the widely used STAR dataset and is on par with SOTA on the\nMultiWOZ dataset, while also providing interpretability.

To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level\nconsensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable\ndeferral.

    "summary": "Mechanistic interpretability strives to explain model behavior in terms of\nbottom-up primitives. The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a\nsparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only\nidentifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual\ninterpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars.\nThis paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that\nmatch token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the\nlikelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based\ndescriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these\ntypes of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.\nWe find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100\nskip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first\nlayer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of\ncounting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into\nrule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be\nextracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they\nrepresent.",

We then introduce\nDiverseAgentEntropy, a novel, theoretically-grounded method employing\nmulti-agent interaction across diverse query variations for uncertainty\nestimation of black-box LLMs. This approach more accurately assesses an LLM's\ntrue uncertainty and improves hallucination detection, outperforming existing\nself-consistency based techniques.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong\nreasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR\nvaries dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied\nto its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from\nunsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training\nin shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's\ninternal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.",

To\naddress this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an\nunderlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask\nconstruction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by\ncapturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.\nTheoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of\ncorrect classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and\nlabel consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective\nattention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a\nhigh level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this\nprinciple across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks\noffer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we\nintroduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with\nMulti-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates\nthree theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert\nrouting mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.\nTo ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme\nthat dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask\nsparsity.

    "summary": "3D landmark detection is a critical task in medical image analysis, and\naccurately detecting anatomical landmarks is essential for subsequent medical\nimaging tasks. However, mainstream deep learning methods in this field struggle\nto simultaneously capture fine-grained local features and model global spatial\nrelationships, while maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational\nefficiency. Local feature extraction requires capturing fine-grained anatomical\ndetails, while global modeling requires understanding the spatial relationships\nwithin complex anatomical structures. The high-dimensional nature of 3D volume\nfurther exacerbates these challenges, as landmarks are sparsely distributed,\nleading to significant computational costs. Therefore, achieving efficient and\nprecise 3D landmark detection remains a pressing challenge in medical image\nanalysis.\n  In this work, We propose a \\textbf{H}ybrid \\textbf{3}D \\textbf{DE}tection\n\\textbf{Net}(H3DE-Net), a novel framework that combines CNNs for local feature\nextraction with a lightweight attention mechanism designed to efficiently\ncapture global dependencies in 3D volumetric data. This mechanism employs a\nhierarchical routing strategy to reduce computational cost while maintaining\nglobal context modeling. To our knowledge, H3DE-Net is the first 3D landmark\ndetection model that integrates such a lightweight attention mechanism with\nCNNs. Additionally, integrating multi-scale feature fusion further enhances\ndetection accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on a public CT dataset\ndemonstrate that H3DE-Net achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance,\nsignificantly improving accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with\nmissing landmarks or complex anatomical variations. We aready open-source our\nproject, including code, data and model weights.",

    "summary": "Recent endeavors in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) aim to unify\nvisual comprehension and generation. However, these two capabilities remain\nlargely independent, as if they are two separate functions encapsulated within\nthe same model. Consequently, visual comprehension does not enhance visual\ngeneration, and the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs have not been fully integrated\nto revolutionize image generation. In this paper, we propose to enable the\ncollaborative co-evolution of visual comprehension and generation, advancing\nimage generation into an iterative introspective process. We introduce a\ntwo-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning teaches the MLLM with the\nfoundational ability to generate genuine CoT for visual generation, while\nreinforcement learning activates its full potential via an\nexploration-exploitation trade-off. Ultimately, we unlock the Aha moment in\nvisual generation, advancing MLLMs from text-to-image tasks to unified image\ngeneration.

    "summary": "The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77\ntokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform\nfine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks\nsupport for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict\nits applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have\nattempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to\nenhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and\nfine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces\nof LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently\nwithout alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can\ndisrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,\nleading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.\nTo address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based\nprogressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP\nimage encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills\nknowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage\nCLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between\nthe LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns\nthe CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text\ncontrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid\noverfitting.

    "summary": "A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained\nonce on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene\nretraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and\nrobustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of\nspectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel \"Rebellious Student\" framework\nfor complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student\nparadigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial\nbranch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary\nspatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning\nstrategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via\nreverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and\n(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized\nusing decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining\nreconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework\nenhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free\nand training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.\nExtensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements\nover several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,\nconfirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary\nlearning paradigm.

Third, existing benchmarks lack\na systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities\nfor building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a\ncomprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could\nunderstand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We\ncollect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,\nsports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and\nextract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which\nare then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators.

    "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time\nview synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual\ncolonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static\nillumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,\nwhich causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic\nscenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS\nmethods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the\ncamera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately\ndegrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the\nillumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical\ncharacters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an\nimproved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance\nunder varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with\ntwo types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt\nto photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the\ngeometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved\nGeometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian\ngeometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is\nleveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.\nComprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our\nproposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and\naccurate geometric reconstruction.

    "summary": "This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting\ntheir inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using\nplanar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -\nwe introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction\nfrom unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to\nextract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and\nsupervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are\npropagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of\nprimitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations\nduring training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane\nsupervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using\nonly depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene\ndatasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to\nout-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation\nprotocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative\npose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our\nmethod emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation.

    "title": "Increasing the Utility of Synthetic Images through Chamfer Guidance",
    "summary": "Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce\ninfinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation\nquality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility\nof these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based\napproaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by\nfocusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions\noftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and\nreal data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free\nguidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to\ncharacterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by\nleveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the\ngenerations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the\ngeneration quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our\napproach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2\nexemplar real images, obtaining 96.4% in terms of precision, and 86.4% in terms\nof distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5% and 92.7%, respectively,\nwhen using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the Chamfer Guidance\ngeneration by training downstream image classifiers on synthetic data,\nachieving accuracy boost of up to 15% for in-distribution over the baselines,\nand up to 16% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach does not\nrequire using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31% reduction in\nFLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling time.",

    "summary": "Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,\nthanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,\ndespite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do\nnot perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate\nmotion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume\nin traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix\ndefined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling\ncapacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion\nmodeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,\nwith the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In\nEMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume\nstyle, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based\nneighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the\nconstructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for\nappearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling\nas well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four\nwidely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,\nSomething-Something V1 & V2.",

    "summary": "Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong\nperformance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned\nimage-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web\ndocuments remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are\ninterleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified\nframework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single\nvision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all\ninputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the\nneed for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture\ncomplex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a\nsnippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal\nsegments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring\nexplicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this\napproach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,\ndesigned to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential\nunderstanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical\nresults show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nCLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such\nas M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web\ndata as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate\nthe scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal\nrepresentation learning.

However, (1) existing benchmarks lack\nthe diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for\nreal-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary\ndimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in\nfine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I\ngeneration. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to\nensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world\nscenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively\nprobes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation\ncriteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess\nmodel robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both\nEnglish and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging\nthe general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities\nof a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,\nGemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark\nconstruction and streamlined model assessment.

Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing\nand clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully\ncurated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process\nby learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments\nshow that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,\ndocument-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in\nthe test set are not present in the training data. We explore different\ncombinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and\npost-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and\nfeature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform\npoorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch\nrepresentations, and high sensitivity to content noise.

To overcome this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,\nhigh-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100\ngrams.

In this AL method, we design an\nActive Test Time Sample Query strategy to select samples from the target\ndomains via two query metrics, including Diversified Knowledge Divergence (DKD)\nand Anatomical Segmentation Difficulty (ASD). DKD is designed to measure the\nsource-target knowledge gap and intra-domain diversity.

To address this gap, we present CUARewardBench,\ncomprising four key contributions: (1) First-ever Comprehensive CUA Reward\nBenchmark: We introduce the first benchmark for evaluating both outcome reward\nmodels (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) on CUA tasks, enabling systematic\nassessment across trajectory-level and step-level evaluation. (2) Diverse,\nPractical and Reliable Dataset: CUARewardBench encompasses trajectories from 10\nsoftware categories and 7 agent architectures with varying performance levels\n(25.9%-50.8% success rates). All trajectories are expertly annotated through\ncarefully designed protocols, with rigorous quality control to ensure\nreliability and practical applicability. (3) Comprehensive Analysis and\nInsights: Through extensive experiments across 7 vision-language models and 3\nprompt templates, we reveal critical limitations of current CUA RMs, including\ninsufficient visual reasoning capabilities, knowledge deficiencies, and the\nsuperiority of general VLMs over specialized CUA models for reward evaluation.\n(4) Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE): Based on the insights from our\ncomprehensive analysis, we propose UPE, a novel ensemble method that\nsignificantly enhances reward model reliability through strict unanimous voting\nand strategic prompt-template configurations. UPE achieves 89.8% precision and\n93.3% NPV for ORM, and 81.7% precision and 85.1% NPV for PRM, substantially\noutperforming single VLMs and traditional ensemble approaches.",

    "summary": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific\nresearch, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and\nreason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in\ndetecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and\nequations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately\nundermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook\nthis issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors\nthat fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench\n(Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first\nbenchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific\npapers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering\nand human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on\nthis set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy\nand pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and\nreason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to\naddress the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice\nevaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding\nthe question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations\nthat minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic\ncues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models\n(GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5\nwith high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%),\nunderscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating\nprogress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.",

    "summary": "Diffusion-based inverse algorithms have shown remarkable performance across\nvarious inverse problems, yet their reliance on numerous denoising steps incurs\nhigh computational costs. While recent developments of fast diffusion ODE\nsolvers offer effective acceleration for diffusion sampling without\nobservations, their application in inverse problems remains limited due to the\nheterogeneous formulations of inverse algorithms and their prevalent use of\napproximations and heuristics, which often introduce significant errors that\nundermine the reliability of analytical solvers. In this work, we begin with an\nanalysis of ODE solvers for inverse problems that reveals a linear combination\nstructure of approximations for the inverse trajectory. Building on this\ninsight, we propose a canonical form that unifies a broad class of\ndiffusion-based inverse algorithms and facilitates the design of more\ngeneralizable solvers. Inspired by the linear subspace search strategy, we\npropose Learnable Linear Extrapolation (LLE), a lightweight approach that\nuniversally enhances the performance of any diffusion-based inverse algorithm\nconforming to our canonical form. LLE optimizes the combination coefficients to\nrefine current predictions using previous estimates, alleviating the\nsensitivity of analytical solvers for inverse algorithms. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate consistent improvements of the proposed LLE method across multiple\nalgorithms and tasks, indicating its potential for more efficient solutions and\nboosted performance of diffusion-based inverse algorithms with limited steps.\nCodes for reproducing our experiments are available at\nhttps://github.com/weigerzan/LLE_inverse_problem.",

However, we find this severely limits\nsemantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose\nCovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the\ncross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature\ndistributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables\njoint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment\nand improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms\nstate-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%\nabsolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.",

In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is\nchallenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To\naddress this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting\nframework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays\nestimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a\npose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates\nmulti-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose\nestimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene\nreconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for\nmore precise Gaussian placement.

MaskWM has two variants: (1) MaskWM-D, which supports global\nwatermark embedding, watermark localization, and local watermark extraction for\napplications such as tamper detection; (2) MaskWM-ED, which focuses on local\nwatermark embedding and extraction, offering enhanced robustness in small\nregions to support fine-grined image protection. MaskWM-D builds on the\nclassical encoder-distortion layer-decoder training paradigm. In MaskWM-D, we\nintroduce a simple masking mechanism during the decoding stage that enables\nboth global and local watermark extraction. During training, the decoder is\nguided by various types of masks applied to watermarked images before\nextraction, helping it learn to localize watermarks and extract them from the\ncorresponding local areas. MaskWM-ED extends this design by incorporating the\nmask into the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the\nwatermark in designated local regions, which improves robustness under regional\nattacks. Extensive experiments show that MaskWM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in global and local watermark extraction, watermark localization,\nand multi-watermark embedding. It outperforms all existing baselines, including\nthe recent leading model WAM for local watermarking, while preserving high\nvisual quality of the watermarked images.

    "summary": "Fluorescence microscopy, while being a key driver for progress in the life\nsciences, is also subject to technical limitations. To overcome them,\ncomputational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow\nmultiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be\nunmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of\nsuperimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is\ncritical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed\nimages for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are\ntrained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not\ncognizant of the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence\nmicroscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called scSplit that is\ncognizant of the severity of the above-mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is\nbased on InDI , a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal\nstarting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We\nintroduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the\ndegradation level (mixing ratio) of a given input image and (ii) a\ndegradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference\nacross all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in\nfluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and\nempirically demonstrate the applicability of scSplit on 5 public datasets.

However, for latent\ndiffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and\ndiffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a\ndegradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is\nineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the\nrepresentation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model\nto be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the\nproposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up\ndiffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training\nrecipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with\nREPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure\nand downstream generation performance.

    "summary": "Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,\nmodels solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated\npatterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training\ndistributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training\nframework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.\nSpecifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a\nlikelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching\nforward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more\nefficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal\nreward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and\ntasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)\nas a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to\nprovide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance\ngroup filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize\noptimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves\n\\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,\nscoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is\nmodel-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to\ndiverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its\nwide applicability.

    "summary": "DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in incentivizing\nreasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs)\nthrough reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, the potential of\nreasoning-induced computation has not been thoroughly explored in the context\nof image quality assessment (IQA), a task depending critically on visual\nreasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a reasoning-induced\nno-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with reinforcement learning to\nrank, a learning algorithm tailored to the intrinsically relative nature of\nvisual quality. Specifically, for a pair of images, we employ group relative\npolicy optimization to generate multiple quality scores for each image. These\nestimates are used to compute comparative probabilities of one image having\nhigher quality than the other under the Thurstone model. Rewards for each\nquality estimate are defined using continuous fidelity measures rather than\ndiscretized binary labels. Extensive experiments show that the proposed\nVisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms discriminative deep learning-based\nNR-IQA models as well as a recent reasoning-induced quality regression method.\nMoreover, VisualQuality-R1 is capable of generating contextually rich,\nhuman-aligned quality descriptions, and supports multi-dataset training without\nrequiring perceptual scale realignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1\nespecially well-suited for reliably measuring progress in a wide range of image\nprocessing tasks like super-resolution and image generation.",

    "summary": "The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on\nthe quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored\nincorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a\nfundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of\nalignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate\nsemantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation\nby proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational\nAutoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's\nsemantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE\ndecoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution\nReconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially\ncoarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of\nrepresentation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed\nSE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows\nus to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically\naccelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training\nstrategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID\n(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).\nWith continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of\n1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.",

Previous efforts navigate this\nchallenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based\noptimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly\ntaps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious\nannotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented\nparadigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels\nfor single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by\nconstructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using\ntraining images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)\nretrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It\nis important to recognize that using only training images without annotations\nexerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In\nthis light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where\ncoarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent\nhistogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce\nhigh-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect\nof artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which\nintegrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and\nprecise pseudo-masks.

The objective of this study is to\nintroduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the\nautomated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted\nMRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models\nwere reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes\nwere computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were\nderived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian\ncurvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was\napplied to these three features to create compact and informative feature\nvectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of\nclassifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:\nStatistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was\nevaluated using paired Welch's t-test.

    "summary": "Dynamic scene reconstruction poses a persistent challenge in 3D vision.\nDeformable 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an effective method for this\ntask, offering real-time rendering and high visual fidelity. This approach\ndecomposes a dynamic scene into a static representation in a canonical space\nand time-varying scene motion. Scene motion is defined as the collective\nmovement of all Gaussian points, and for compactness, existing approaches\ncommonly adopt implicit neural fields or sparse control points. However, these\nmethods predominantly rely on gradient-based optimization for all motion\ninformation. Due to the high degree of freedom, they struggle to converge on\nreal-world datasets exhibiting complex motion. To preserve the compactness of\nmotion representation and address convergence challenges, this paper proposes\nheterogeneous 3D control points, termed \\textbf{H3D control points}, whose\nattributes are obtained using a hybrid strategy combining optical flow\nback-projection and gradient-based methods. This design decouples directly\nobservable motion components from those that are geometrically occluded.\nSpecifically, components of 3D motion that project onto the image plane are\ndirectly acquired via optical flow back projection, while unobservable portions\nare refined through gradient-based optimization. Experiments on the Neu3DV and\nCMU-Panoptic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance\nover state-of-the-art deformable 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. Remarkably,\nour method converges within just 100 iterations and achieves a per-frame\nprocessing speed of 2 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX 4070 GPU.",

    "title": "Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment for Image Complexity Assessment",
    "summary": "Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual\nevaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent\nsemantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly\nrely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of\na single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived\nrepresentations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal\nscene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various\ncomputer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.\nHowever, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the\ncontext of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which\nleverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance\nICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with\nsubjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a\ncomplexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The\ncomplexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the\nguidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic\nalignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that\nconvey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive\nexperiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Recent studies have\ndemonstrated that wavelet analysis can enhance the generalization abilities of\nforgery detectors.

    "summary": "Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the\npossibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously\ncorrelated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance\nperformance on the training data, they result in substantial performance\ndegradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to\nperform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the\nsemantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this\napproach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The\nreconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can\nperpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction\nmodels tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly\ndue to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level\nmisalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency\ncontent than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating\nhigh-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues.\nTo resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the\npixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets:\nDDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector\nperformance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest\ngenerative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures\nsuch as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could\nimprove across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on\nin-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased\ndetectors.

    "summary": "Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer\nthat destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding\nhealthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of\ncryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This\nplanning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading\nto variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we\nintroduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation\nplanning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for\ncryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical\nconstraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially\nselects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward\nfunction based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy\nthat leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any\nmanually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,\nCryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the\nbest automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human\nexpert performance while requiring substantially less planning time.

    "summary": "While large machine learning models have shown remarkable performance in\nvarious domains, their training typically requires iterating for many passes\nover the training data. However, due to computational and memory constraints\nand potential privacy concerns, storing and accessing all the data is\nimpractical in many real-world scenarios where the data arrives in a stream. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of one-pass learning, in which a model\nis trained on sequentially arriving data without retraining on previous\ndatapoints. Motivated by the demonstrated effectiveness of overparameterized\nmodels and the phenomenon of benign overfitting, we propose Orthogonal\nRecursive Fitting (ORFit), an algorithm for one-pass learning which seeks to\nperfectly fit each new datapoint while minimally altering the predictions on\nprevious datapoints. ORFit updates the parameters in a direction orthogonal to\npast gradients, similar to orthogonal gradient descent (OGD) in continual\nlearning. We show that, interestingly, ORFit's update leads to an operation\nsimilar to the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm in adaptive filtering\nbut with significantly improved memory and computational efficiency, i.e.,\nlinear, instead of quadratic, in the number of parameters.

We present a counterfactual inference\nframework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,\nillustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19\n(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal\ndiagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,\nwe integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to\nidentify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions.

Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed\nSARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative\nperformance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,\npatient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity\npatterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes.

This review\nprovides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with\nneural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based\nmethods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation\n(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder\nscalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or\nzeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that\nrely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample\nefficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can\neffectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP\nin neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for\nbiology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and\nfeedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological\nlearning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain\nlearns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based\non the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,\nsecond-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how\nthese methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training\nand the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to\nview biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO\nparadigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.\nThis framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence\nbut also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design\nfast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.",

    "summary": "While Variational Inference (VI) is central to modern generative models like\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), its\npedagogical treatment is split across disciplines. In statistics, VI is\ntypically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machine\nlearning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint,\nwhere VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. This creates a\nbarrier for statisticians, as the principles behind VAEs and DDMs are hard to\ncontextualize without a corresponding Frequentist introduction to VI. This\npaper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for VI, VAEs, and DDMs\nfrom a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show how VI arises as a scalable\nsolution for intractable E-steps and how VAEs and DDMs are natural,\ndeep-learning-based extensions of this framework, thereby bridging the gap\nbetween classical statistical inference and modern generative AI.",

    "summary": "Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical\ninterventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access\ndue to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable\nasset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new\ninference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that\nclosely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not\nconsider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and\nspecifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of\ndesiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise\ndownstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the\ntreatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.\nBased on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess\nsuch synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating\nSynthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the\ndata-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our\ndesiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,\nparticularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.",

The accurate estimation (or\ndiscovery) of these functions from data is a central problem in machine\nlearning, with wide application across the natural and social sciences. Yet\ncurrent solutions either rely heavily on prior knowledge of the dynamics or\ninvolve intricate training procedures. We introduce FIM-SDE (Foundation\nInference Model for SDEs), a pretrained recognition model that delivers\naccurate in-context (or zero-shot) estimation of the drift and diffusion\nfunctions of low-dimensional SDEs, from noisy time series data, and allows\nrapid finetuning to target datasets.

Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally\nrepresentative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and\nconditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing\non distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions\nreduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden\ngroups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy\nburdens see little to no reduction.

    "summary": "Online Speech Enhancement was mainly reserved for predictive models. A key\nadvantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream of\ndata, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generative\nSpeech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in a\ncomputational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancement\napplications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative\ndiffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network\ncall per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement\nin an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion\nBuffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approach\nprogressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames have\nmore noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listener\nwith a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has a\ncorresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work by\ncarefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specifically\naligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposed\nUNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low.\nMoreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising Score\nMatching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmic\nlatency and quality during inference. The extended Diffusion Buffer equipped\nwith a novel NN and loss function drastically reduces the algorithmic latency\nfrom 320 - 960 ms to 32 - 176 ms with an even increased performance. While it\nhas been shown before that offline generative diffusion models outperform\npredictive approaches in unseen noisy speech data, we confirm that the online\nDiffusion Buffer also outperforms its predictive counterpart on unseen noisy\nspeech data.",

    "summary": "Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for\nestimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is\nintractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered\nby model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world\nobservations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI\napproach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process\nthat combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based\ndistribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,\nrequiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits\nscalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized\nSBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a\nsingle, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a\nclosed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond\nto the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired\nsamples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the\nOT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at\ntest time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including\ncomplex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the\nperformance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,\nwhile offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,\nmisspecified environments.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose an\ninfrastructure-free federated learning framework based on a model dispersal\n(FedMeld) strategy, which exploits periodic movement patterns and\nstore-carry-forward capabilities of satellites to enable parameter mixing\nacross large-scale geographical regions. We theoretically show that FedMeld\nleads to global model convergence and quantify the effects of round interval\nand mixing ratio between adjacent areas on its learning performance. Based on\nthe theoretical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem to design\nthe staleness control and mixing ratio (SC-MR) for minimizing the training\nloss. By decomposing the problem into sequential SC and MR subproblems without\ncompromising the optimality, we derive the round interval solution in a closed\nform and the mixing ratio in a semi-closed form to achieve the optimal\nlatency-accuracy tradeoff.

    "summary": "Enabling robots to autonomously discover emergent spatial concepts (e.g.,\nrooms) from primitive geometric observations (e.g., planar surfaces) within 3D\nScene Graphs is essential for robust indoor navigation and mapping. These\ngraphs provide a hierarchical metric-semantic representation in which such\nconcepts are organized. To further enhance graph-SLAM performance, Factorized\n3D Scene Graphs incorporate these concepts as optimization factors that\nconstrain relative geometry and enforce global consistency. However, both\nstages of this process remain largely manual: concepts are typically derived\nusing hand-crafted, concept-specific heuristics, while factors and their\ncovariances are likewise manually designed. This reliance on manual\nspecification limits generalization across diverse environments and scalability\nto new concept classes. This paper presents, for the first time, a\nlearning-based method to generate online spatial emergent concepts as\noptimizable factors within a SLAM backend, reducing the need to handcraft both\nconcept generation and the definition of their corresponding factors and\ncovariances. In both simulated and real indoor scenarios, our approach improves\ncomplex concept detection by 20.7% and 5.3%, trajectory estimation by 19.2%,\nand map reconstruction by 12.3% and 3.8%, respectively, highlighting the\nbenefits of this integration for robust and adaptive spatial understanding.",

    "summary": "Understanding how the test risk scales with model complexity is a central\nquestion in machine learning. Classical theory is challenged by the learning\ncurves observed for large over-parametrized deep networks. Capacity measures\nbased on parameter count typically fail to account for these empirical\nobservations. To tackle this challenge, we consider norm-based capacity\nmeasures and develop our study for random features based estimators, widely\nused as simplified theoretical models for more complex networks. In this\ncontext, we provide a precise characterization of how the estimator's norm\nconcentrates and how it governs the associated test error. Our results show\nthat the predicted learning curve admits a phase transition from under- to\nover-parameterization, but no double descent behavior. This confirms that more\nclassical U-shaped behavior is recovered considering appropriate capacity\nmeasures based on models norms rather than size. From a technical point of\nview, we leverage deterministic equivalence as the key tool and further develop\nnew deterministic quantities which are of independent interest.",

In\nmany real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,\nagents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide\nadditional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are\ninherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP\nleads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.\nMoreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented\nMDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot\naccommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We\naddress these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the\n\\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware\npolicy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \\emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis\non the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of\nimperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with\nOnline Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline\nBayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time\npredictions.

    "summary": "Explainability is a key component in many applications involving deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). However, current explanation methods for DNNs commonly leave\nit to the human observer to distinguish relevant explanations from spurious\nnoise. This is not feasible anymore when going from easily human-accessible\ndata such as images to more complex data such as genome sequences. To\nfacilitate the accessibility of DNN outputs from such complex data and to\nincrease explainability, we present a modification of the widely used\nexplanation method layer-wise relevance propagation. Our approach enforces\nsparsity directly by pruning the relevance propagation for the different\nlayers. Thereby, we achieve sparser relevance attributions for the input\nfeatures as well as for the intermediate layers. As the relevance propagation\nis input-specific, we aim to prune the relevance propagation rather than the\nunderlying model architecture. This allows to prune different neurons for\ndifferent inputs and hence, might be more appropriate to the local nature of\nexplanation methods. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we evaluate it\non two types of data: images and genome sequences. We show that our\nmodification indeed leads to noise reduction and concentrates relevance on the\nmost important features compared to the baseline.",

    "summary": "Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a\nphysical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches\nbased on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to\naddress a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled\nin time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology\nthat leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods\nfor PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the\nsampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of\nequation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy\noptimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be\nexploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient\ndescent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both\ntraditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with\ndifferent numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows\nto tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.",

    "summary": "Deep learning-based semantic communication has largely relied on analog or\nsemi-digital transmission, which limits compatibility with modern digital\ncommunication infrastructures. Recent studies have employed vector quantization\n(VQ) to enable discrete semantic transmission, yet existing methods neglect\nchannel state information during codebook optimization, leading to suboptimal\nrobustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a channel-aware vector quantization\n(CAVQ) algorithm within a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, termed\nVQJSCC, established on a discrete memoryless channel. In this framework,\nsemantic features are discretized and directly mapped to modulation\nconstellation symbols, while CAVQ integrates channel transition probabilities\ninto the quantization process, aligning easily confused symbols with\nsemantically similar codewords. A multi-codebook alignment mechanism is further\nintroduced to handle mismatches between codebook order and modulation order by\ndecomposing the transmission stream into multiple independently optimized\nsubchannels. Experimental results demonstrate that VQJSCC effectively mitigates\nthe digital cliff effect, achieves superior reconstruction quality across\nvarious modulation schemes, and outperforms state-of-the-art digital semantic\ncommunication baselines in both robustness and efficiency.",

In TCGA breast cancer (n=967, 133\ndeaths), low event rates (13.8%) create severe power limitations, producing\nfalse negatives for known drivers and false positives for large passenger\ngenes. Results: We developed a five-criteria computational framework\nintegrating causal inference (inverse probability weighting, doubly robust\nestimation) with orthogonal biological validation (expression, mutation\npatterns, literature evidence). Applied to TCGA-BRCA mortality analysis,\nstandard Cox+FDR detected zero genes at FDR<0.05, confirming complete failure\nin underpowered settings. Our framework correctly identified RYR2 - a cardiac\ngene with no cancer function - as a false positive despite nominal significance\n(p=0.024), while identifying KMT2C as a complex candidate requiring validation\ndespite marginal significance (p=0.047, q=0.954).

To address\nthis issue, traditional methods introduce a missing indicator matrix and focus\non mining partial structure among existing samples in each view for label\npropagation (LP). However, we argue that these disregarded missing samples\nsometimes induce discontinuous local structures, i.e., sub-clusters, breaking\nthe fundamental smoothness assumption in LP. Consequently, such a Sub-Cluster\nProblem (SCP) would distort graph fusion and degrade classification\nperformance. To alleviate SCP, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view\nsemi-supervised learning method, termed AGF-TI. Firstly, we design an\nadversarial graph fusion scheme to learn a robust consensus graph against the\ndistorted local structure through a min-max framework. By stacking all\nsimilarity matrices into a tensor, we further recover the incomplete structure\nfrom the high-order consistency information based on the low-rank tensor\nlearning. Additionally, the anchor-based strategy is incorporated to reduce the\ncomputational complexity. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm\ncombining a reduced gradient descent method is developed to solve the\nformulated objective, with theoretical convergence.

    "summary": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) holds a great deal of promise for applications\nin neuroscience, due to the lack of large-scale, consistently labeled neural\ndatasets. However, most neural datasets contain heterogeneous populations that\nmix stable, predictable cells with highly stochastic, stimulus-contingent ones,\nwhich has made it hard to identify consistent activity patterns during SSL. As\na result, self-supervised pretraining has yet to show clear signs of benefits\nfrom scale on neural data. Here, we present a novel approach to self-supervised\npretraining, POYO-SSL that exploits the heterogeneity of neural data to improve\npre-training and achieve benefits of scale. Specifically, in POYO-SSL we\npretrain only on predictable (statistically regular) neurons-identified on the\npretraining split via simple higher-order statistics (skewness and\nkurtosis)-then we fine-tune on the unpredictable population for downstream\ntasks. On the Allen Brain Observatory dataset, this strategy yields\napproximately 12-13% relative gains over from-scratch training and exhibits\nsmooth, monotonic scaling with model size. In contrast, existing\nstate-of-the-art baselines plateau or destabilize as model size increases. By\nmaking predictability an explicit metric for crafting the data diet, POYO-SSL\nturns heterogeneity from a liability into an asset, providing a robust,\nbiologically grounded recipe for scalable neural decoding and a path toward\nfoundation models of neural dynamics.",

    "summary": "We present a novel geometric perspective on the latent space of diffusion\nmodels. We first show that the standard pullback approach, utilizing the\ndeterministic probability flow ODE decoder, is fundamentally flawed. It\nprovably forces geodesics to decode as straight segments in data space,\neffectively ignoring any intrinsic data geometry beyond the ambient Euclidean\nspace. Complementing this view, diffusion also admits a stochastic decoder via\nthe reverse SDE, which enables an information geometric treatment with the\nFisher-Rao metric. However, a choice of $x_T$ as the latent representation\ncollapses this metric due to memorylessness. We address this by introducing a\nlatent spacetime $z=(x_t,t)$ that indexes the family of denoising distributions\n$p(x_0 | x_t)$ across all noise scales, yielding a nontrivial geometric\nstructure. We prove these distributions form an exponential family and derive\nsimulation-free estimators for curve lengths, enabling efficient geodesic\ncomputation. The resulting structure induces a principled Diffusion Edit\nDistance, where geodesics trace minimal sequences of noise and denoise edits\nbetween data. We also demonstrate benefits for transition path sampling in\nmolecular systems, including constrained variants such as low-variance\ntransitions and region avoidance.

While domain-level reweighting (e.g., DreamPRM)\naligns training with test-time objectives, it leaves a clear gap to an oracle\nupper bound (pass@N), even under a \"sanity check\" that uses test set data to\nprobe headroom -- pointing to meta-level under-parameterization. We introduce\nDreamPRM-1.5, an instance-level reweighting framework that assigns an adaptive\nweight to every training example via bi-level optimization. To realize instance\nreweighting across scales, we develop two complementary regimes: Instance\nTable, which learns explicit per-sample weights and excels on small/medium\ndata, and Instance Net, a lightweight neural network that generalizes better\nand scales to large corpora. A practical, stable training recipe -- time-scale\nmatching between upper/lower updates, cold-start initialization, and\nbounded-range weights -- prevents divergence. Integrated with test-time\nscaling, DreamPRM-1.5 attains 84.6 accuracy on the MMMU validation set, 31.3\naccuracy on R-Bench-V and, when paired with a leading backbone (e.g.,\nGPT-5-mini), achieves first-place results on public multimodal reasoning\nleaderboards.

However, traditional FL approaches often face\nlimitations in scalability and efficiency due to their reliance on synchronous\nclient updates, which can result in significant delays and increased\ncommunication overhead, particularly in heterogeneous and dynamic environments.\nTo address these challenges in this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Federated\nLearning (AFL) algorithm, which allows clients to update the global model\nindependently and asynchronously. Our key contributions include a comprehensive\nconvergence analysis of AFL in the presence of client delays and model\nstaleness. By leveraging martingale difference sequence theory and variance\nbounds, we ensure robust convergence despite asynchronous updates. Assuming\nstrongly convex local objective functions, we establish bounds on gradient\nvariance under random client sampling and derive a recursion formula\nquantifying the impact of client delays on convergence. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the practical applicability of the AFL algorithm by training\ndecentralized linear regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based\nclassifiers and compare its results with synchronous FL algorithm to\neffectively handling non-IID data distributed among clients. The proposed AFL\nalgorithm addresses key limitations of traditional FL methods, such as\ninefficiency due to global synchronization and susceptibility to client drift.\nIt enhances scalability, robustness, and efficiency in real-world settings with\nheterogeneous client populations and dynamic network conditions.

    "summary": "Balancing resource efficiency and fairness is critical in networked systems\nthat support modern learning applications. We introduce the Fair Minimum\nLabeling (FML) problem: the task of designing a minimum-cost temporal edge\nactivation plan that ensures each group of nodes in a network has sufficient\naccess to a designated target set, according to specified coverage\nrequirements. FML captures key trade-offs in systems where edge activations\nincur resource costs and equitable access is essential, such as distributed\ndata collection, update dissemination in edge-cloud systems, and fair service\nrestoration in critical infrastructure. We show that FML is NP-hard and\n$\\Omega(\\log |V|)$-hard to approximate, where $V$ is the set of nodes, and we\npresent probabilistic approximation algorithms that match this bound, achieving\nthe best possible guarantee for the activation cost. We demonstrate the\npractical utility of FML in a fair multi-source data aggregation task for\ntraining a shared model. Empirical results show that FML enforces group-level\nfairness with substantially lower activation cost than baseline heuristics,\nunderscoring its potential for building resource-efficient, equitable temporal\nreachability in learning-integrated networks.",

Although existing sample\nselection methods have achieved decent results by reducing the noise rate of\nthe selected subset, they often overlook that not all mislabeled examples harm\nthe model's performance equally. In this paper, we demonstrate that mislabeled\nexamples correctly predicted by the model early in the training process are\nparticularly harmful to model performance. We refer to these examples as\nMislabeled Easy Examples (MEEs). To address this, we propose Early Cutting,\nwhich introduces a recalibration step that employs the model's later training\nstate to re-select the confident subset identified early in training, thereby\navoiding misleading confidence from early learning and effectively filtering\nout MEEs. Experiments on the CIFAR, WebVision, and full ImageNet-1k datasets\ndemonstrate that our method effectively improves sample selection and model\nperformance by reducing MEEs.",

    "summary": "Thermocouples are in widespread use in industry, but they are particularly\nsusceptible to calibration drift in harsh environments. Self-validating\nthermocouples aim to address this issue by using a miniature phase-change cell\n(fixed-point) in close proximity to the measurement junction (tip) of the\nthermocouple. The fixed point is a crucible containing an ingot of metal with a\nknown melting temperature. When the process temperature being monitored passes\nthrough the melting temperature of the ingot, the thermocouple output exhibits\na \"plateau\" during melting. Since the melting temperature of the ingot is\nknown, the thermocouple can be recalibrated in situ. Identifying the melting\nplateau to determine the onset of melting is reasonably well established but\nrequires manual intervention involving zooming in on the region around the\nactual melting temperature, a process which can depend on the shape of the\nmelting plateau. For the first time, we present a novel machine learning\napproach to recognize and identify the characteristic shape of the melting\nplateau and once identified, to quantity the point at which melting begins,\nalong with its associated uncertainty. This removes the need for human\nintervention in locating and characterizing the melting point. Results from\ntest data provided by CCPI Europe show 100% accuracy of melting plateau\ndetection.

    "summary": "Federated learning (FL) enables multiple edge devices to collaboratively\ntrain a machine learning model without the need to share potentially private\ndata. Federated learning proceeds through iterative exchanges of model updates,\nwhich pose two key challenges: First, the accumulation of privacy leakage over\ntime, and second, communication latency. These two limitations are typically\naddressed separately: The former via perturbed updates to enhance privacy and\nthe latter using user selection to mitigate latency - both at the expense of\naccuracy. In this work, we propose a method that jointly addresses the\naccumulation of privacy leakage and communication latency via active user\nselection, aiming to improve the trade-off among privacy, latency, and model\nperformance. To achieve this, we construct a reward function that accounts for\nthese three objectives. Building on this reward, we propose a multi-armed\nbandit (MAB)-based algorithm, termed Privacy-aware Active User SElection\n(PAUSE) which dynamically selects a subset of users each round while ensuring\nbounded overall privacy leakage. We establish a theoretical analysis,\nsystematically showing that the reward growth rate of PAUSE follows that of the\nbest-known rate in MAB literature. To address the complexity overhead of active\nuser selection, we propose a simulated annealing-based relaxation of PAUSE and\nanalyze its ability to approximate the reward-maximizing policy under reduced\ncomplexity. We numerically validate the privacy leakage, associated improved\nlatency, and accuracy gains of our methods for the federated training in\nvarious scenarios.",

    "summary": "Respiratory diseases account for a significant portion of global mortality.\nAffordable and early detection is an effective way of addressing these\nailments. To this end, a low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), IEEE\n802.15.4z standard compliant impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar system\nis used to estimate human respiration rates. We propose a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) specifically adapted to predict breathing rates from\nultra-wideband (UWB) channel impulse response (CIR) data, and compare its\nperformance with both other rule-based algorithms and model-based solutions.\nThe study uses a diverse dataset, incorporating various real-life environments\nto evaluate system robustness. To facilitate future research, this dataset will\nbe released as open source. Results show that the CNN achieves a mean absolute\nerror (MAE) of 1.73 breaths per minute (BPM) in unseen situations,\nsignificantly outperforming rule-based methods (3.40 BPM). By incorporating\ncalibration data from other individuals in the unseen situations, the error is\nfurther reduced to 0.84 BPM. In addition, this work evaluates the feasibility\nof running the pipeline on a low-cost embedded device. Applying 8-bit\nquantization to both the weights and input/ouput tensors, reduces memory\nrequirements by 67% and inference time by 64% with only a 3% increase in MAE.\nAs a result, we show it is feasible to deploy the algorithm on an nRF52840\nsystem-on-chip (SoC) requiring only 46 KB of memory and operating with an\ninference time of only 192 ms. Once deployed, an analytical energy model\nestimates that the system, while continuously monitoring the room, can operate\nfor up to 268 days without recharging when powered by a 20 000 mAh battery\npack. For breathing monitoring in bed, the sampling rate can be lowered,\nextending battery life to 313 days, making the solution highly efficient for\nreal-world, low-cost deployments.",

It is challenging to assess\npost-deployment performance accurately when labels are missing or delayed.\nExisting proxy methods, such as data drift detection, fail to measure the\neffects of these shifts adequately. To address this, we introduce a new method\nfor evaluating binary classification models on unlabeled tabular data that\naccurately estimates model performance under covariate shift and call it\nProbabilistic Adaptive Performance Estimation (PAPE). It can be applied to any\nperformance metric defined with elements of the confusion matrix. Crucially,\nPAPE operates independently of the original model, relying only on its\npredictions and probability estimates, and does not need any assumptions about\nthe nature of covariate shift, learning directly from data instead. We tested\nPAPE using over 900 dataset-model combinations from US census data, assessing\nits performance against several benchmarks through various metrics. Our\nfindings show that PAPE outperforms other methodologies, making it a superior\nchoice for estimating the performance of binary classification models.",

    "summary": "Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for\ntransferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target\ngraph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the\nclosed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label\nspaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world\nscenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in\nthe source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised\nopen-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly\nclassify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously\nunseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel\nframework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and\nmodel sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph\nstructure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and\nunknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning\ndomain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while\npreserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.\nAdditionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown\nclass, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set\nrecognition.

We refer to a parametrisation\n  of this property of a given training set, as its ``inhomogeneity\n  parameter''. It is easy to compute this parameter for small-to-large\n  datasets, and we demonstrate such computation on multiple\n  publicly-available datasets, while also demonstrating that\n  conventional ``non-stationarity'' of data does not imply a non-zero\n  inhomogeneity parameter of the dataset. We prove that - within the\n  probabilistic Gaussian Process-based learning approach - a training\n  set with a non-zero inhomogeneity parameter renders it imperative,\n  that the process that is invoked to model the sought function, be\n  non-stationary. Following the learning of a real-world multivariate\n  function with such a Process, quality and reliability of predictions\n  at test inputs, are demonstrated to be affected by the inhomogeneity\n  parameter of the training data.",

Previous works have designed\nvarious deep-learning methods using historical records to predict traffic\naccident occurrences.

This paper constructs a large-scale,\nunified dataset of traffic accident records from official reports of various\nstates in the US, totaling 9 million records, accompanied by road networks and\ntraffic volume reports. Using this new dataset, we evaluate existing\ndeep-learning methods for predicting the occurrence of accidents on road\nnetworks.

However, existing temporal causal representation learning\nmethods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint\ndistribution of hierarchical latent variables from \\textit{single-timestep\nobserved variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of\nhierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three\nconditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a\nCausally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our\napproach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the\njoint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit\nthe natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to\nidentify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,\nwe develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.\nThis model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent\nvariables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the\nindependent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical\nevaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical\nclaims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical\nlatent dynamics.",

As scanning the entire directional\nspace is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the\noptimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms\nrequire a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing\nworks propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on\nunimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.\nHowever, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)\nin practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal\nbeams.\n  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms\n\\textit{pretc} and \\textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property\nof mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to\nthe Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each\npath as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled\nhistorical rewards. \\textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and\nthen commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.\n\\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the\nbest beam under current estimates.

    "summary": "Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between\nidentity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While\nonline reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising\nsolution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive\ndegradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights\ncauses conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal\ndynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nCustomized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)\nSynergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly\npenalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a\nsharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),\nwhich aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by\nprioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nnaive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation.

Learning\ntravel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world\napplications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges.\nFirst, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and\npoints-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in\ntextual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to\nmodeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which\nharm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address\nthese challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and\nsemantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a\nTraj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS\nand road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of\ncontinuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware\nPre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings\nwithout introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce\nredundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation\nPre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask\ngenerator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings.

Based on these findings, we propose DEX, a novel method to\nefficiently integrate the advantages of differential attention into pretrained\nlanguage models.

The\nprototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns\nwith coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with\ndetailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.\nExperiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF\ndataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast\naccuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model\nunderstanding and decision support.",

    "summary": "Data-driven stochastic optimization is ubiquitous in machine learning and\noperational decision-making problems. Sample average approximation (SAA) and\nmodel-based approaches such as estimate-then-optimize (ETO) or integrated\nestimation-optimization (IEO) are all popular, with model-based approaches\nbeing able to circumvent some of the issues with SAA in complex\ncontext-dependent problems. Yet the relative performance of these methods is\npoorly understood, with most results confined to the dichotomous cases of the\nmodel-based approach being either well-specified or misspecified. We develop\nthe first results that allow for a more granular analysis of the relative\nperformance of these methods under a local misspecification setting, which\nmodels the scenario where the model-based approach is nearly well-specified. By\nleveraging tools from contiguity theory in statistics, we show that there is a\nbias-variance tradeoff between SAA, IEO, and ETO under local misspecification,\nand that the relative importance of the bias and the variance depends on the\ndegree of local misspecification. Moreover, we derive explicit expressions for\nthe decision bias, which allows us to characterize (un)impactful\nmisspecification directions, and provide further geometric understanding of the\nvariance.",

    "summary": "Despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still generate\nvulnerable code. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to\nenhance LLMs for secure code generation by incorporating external security\nknowledge. However, the conventional RAG design struggles with the noise of raw\nsecurity-related documents, and existing retrieval methods overlook the\nsignificant security semantics implicitly embedded in task descriptions. To\naddress these issues, we propose RESCUE, a new RAG framework for secure code\ngeneration with two key innovations. First, we propose a hybrid knowledge base\nconstruction method that combines LLM-assisted cluster-then-summarize\ndistillation with program slicing, producing both high-level security\nguidelines and concise, security-focused code examples. Second, we design a\nhierarchical multi-faceted retrieval to traverse the constructed knowledge base\nfrom top to bottom and integrates multiple security-critical facts at each\nhierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive and accurate retrieval. We evaluated\nRESCUE on four benchmarks and compared it with five state-of-the-art secure\ncode generation methods on six LLMs. The results demonstrate that RESCUE\nimproves the SecurePass@1 metric by an average of 4.8 points, establishing a\nnew state-of-the-art performance for security.

However, efficiently\ncompressing unstructured, high-precision point cloud data remains a significant\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose NeRC$^3$, a novel point cloud compression\nframework that leverages implicit neural representations (INRs) to encode both\ngeometry and attributes of dense point clouds. Our approach employs two\ncoordinate-based neural networks: one maps spatial coordinates to voxel\noccupancy, while the other maps occupied voxels to their attributes, thereby\nimplicitly representing the geometry and attributes of a voxelized point cloud.\nThe encoder quantizes and compresses network parameters alongside auxiliary\ninformation required for reconstruction, while the decoder reconstructs the\noriginal point cloud by inputting voxel coordinates into the neural networks.\nFurthermore, we extend our method to dynamic point cloud compression through\ntechniques that reduce temporal redundancy, including a 4D spatio-temporal\nrepresentation termed 4D-NeRC$^3$. Experimental results validate the\neffectiveness of our approach: For static point clouds, NeRC$^3$ outperforms\noctree-based G-PCC standard and existing INR-based methods. For dynamic point\nclouds, 4D-NeRC$^3$ achieves superior geometry compression performance compared\nto the latest G-PCC and V-PCC standards, while matching state-of-the-art\nlearning-based methods.

While regularization-based\nmethods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized\nequilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to\napproximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.\nInstead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and\nachieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main\ntheoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic\nimprovement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum\ngames, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,\nwe develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which\npreserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely\non the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable\nor lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark\ngames and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas\nHold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.",

    "summary": "There has been a surge of recent interest in automatically learning policies\nto target treatment decisions based on rich individual covariates. A common\napproach is to train a machine learning model to predict counterfactual\noutcomes, and then select the policy that optimizes the predicted objective\nvalue. In addition, practitioners also want confidence that the learned policy\nhas better performance than the incumbent policy according to downstream policy\nevaluation. However, due to the winner's curse-an issue where the policy\noptimization procedure exploits prediction errors rather than finding actual\nimprovements-predicted performance improvements are often not substantiated by\ndownstream policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nstrategy called inference-aware policy optimization, which modifies policy\noptimization to account for how the policy will be evaluated downstream.\nSpecifically, it optimizes not only for the estimated objective value, but also\nfor the chances that the policy will be statistically significantly better than\nthe observational policy used to collect data. We mathematically characterize\nthe Pareto frontier of policies according to the tradeoff of these two goals.\nBased on our characterization, we design a policy optimization algorithm that\nuses machine learning to predict counterfactual outcomes, and then plugs in\nthese predictions to estimate the Pareto frontier; then, the decision-maker can\nselect the policy that optimizes their desired tradeoff, after which policy\nevaluation can be performed on the test set as usual.

In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the\nimplications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected\ncoresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an\nextensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations\nbenchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,\nand five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.\nThereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between\nsample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant\nmodel robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using\nembedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk\nof inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based\non learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some\ncoreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing\ndifficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.",

    "summary": "The opacity of many supervised learning algorithms remains a key challenge,\nhindering scientific discovery and limiting broader deployment--particularly in\nhigh-stakes domains. This paper develops model- and distribution-agnostic\nsignificance tests to assess the influence of input features in any regression\nor classification algorithm. Our method evaluates a feature's incremental\ncontribution to model performance by masking its values across samples. Under\nthe null hypothesis, the distribution of performance differences across a test\nset has a non-positive median. We construct a uniformly most powerful,\nrandomized sign test for this median, yielding exact p-values for assessing\nfeature significance and confidence intervals with exact coverage for\nestimating population-level feature importance. The approach requires minimal\nassumptions, avoids model retraining or auxiliary models, and remains\ncomputationally efficient even for large-scale, high-dimensional settings.\nExperiments on synthetic tasks validate its statistical and computational\nadvantages, and applications to real-world data demonstrate its ability to\ninform high-stakes decisions with legal, economic, and regulatory implications.",

At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional\nField (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of\nthe nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using\nmolecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields\n(MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we\nadopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,\ngenerates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with\ngenerative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion\nmodel, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design\nnaturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support\nstructure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by\nselectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and\ncontinuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for\nmolecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or\npoint cloud based methods.

In existing systems, core attention is colocated with\nother layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to\nthe near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers\nacross data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.\nFirst, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only\nminimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.\nSecond, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when\nprocessing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD\npartitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to\ndedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize\ncompute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system\ncalled DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap\ncommunication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to\nreduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,\nDistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data\nand pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory\nbalance.",

This paper presents theoretical results for\noverparameterized two-layer ReLU networks trained below the edge of stability.\nFirst, for data distributions supported on a mixture of low-dimensional balls,\nwe derive generalization bounds that provably adapt to the intrinsic dimension.\nSecond, for a family of isotropic distributions that vary in how strongly\nprobability mass concentrates toward the unit sphere, we derive a spectrum of\nbounds showing that rates deteriorate as the mass concentrates toward the\nsphere. These results instantiate a unifying principle: When the data is harder\nto \"shatter\" with respect to the activation thresholds of the ReLU neurons,\ngradient descent tends to learn representations that capture shared patterns\nand thus finds solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, for data that\nis easily shattered (e.g., data supported on the sphere) gradient descent\nfavors memorization.

We compared these methods against the\nclassical computer algebra system GAP, demonstrating that they \"overcome the\nGAP\" for the considered examples. As a particular mathematical application we\nexamine the Cayley graph of the symmetric group with cyclic shift and\ntransposition generators. We provide strong support for the OEIS-A186783\nconjecture that the diameter is equal to n(n-1)/2 by machine learning and\nmathematical methods.

We also present several conjectures motivated by\nnumerical experiments, including observations on the central limit phenomenon\n(with growth approximated by a Gumbel distribution), the uniform distribution\nfor the spectrum of the graph, and a numerical study of sorting networks.

In this work, we focus on ReLU activation and reveal\na novel and intriguing property of nonlinear activations.

Furthermore, we show that the network depth (i.e.,\nwith more nonlinear activation operations) further amplifies these effects; in\naddition, in the infinite-width-then-depth limit, all data are equally\nseparated with a fixed angle in the model gradient feature space, regardless of\nhow similar they are originally in the input space. Note that, without the\nnonlinear activation, i.e., in a linear neural network, the data separation\nremains the same as for the original inputs and NTK condition number is\nequivalent to the Gram matrix, regardless of the network depth.

A common practical approach is to\naugment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to\nprevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering\nis often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning\nprocess. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not\ninherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a\nsufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.\nWe formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),\nwhich requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of\ncatastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP\nin which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is\nconsidered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that\n(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL\nconvergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is\noptimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the\nsame asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a\ncomplete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We\nvalidate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and\nconstraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance\nmatching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light\non a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,\nprincipled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most\npermissive safety filter that is available.",

    "summary": "Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) has been increasingly employed\nin health technology assessments (HTA). By reweighting subjects from a trial\nwith individual participant data (IPD) to match the covariate summary\nstatistics of another trial with only aggregate data (AgD), MAIC facilitates\nthe estimation of a treatment effect defined with respect to the AgD trial\npopulation. This manuscript introduces a new class of methods, termed\narbitrated indirect treatment comparisons, designed to address the ``MAIC\nparadox'' -- a phenomenon highlighted by Jiang et al.~(2025). The MAIC paradox\narises when different sponsors, analyzing the same data, reach conflicting\nconclusions regarding which treatment is more effective. The underlying issue\nis that each sponsor implicitly targets a different population. To resolve this\ninconsistency, the proposed methods focus on estimating treatment effects in a\ncommon target population, specifically chosen to be the overlap population.",

However, these physics losses rely on derivatives.\nComputing these derivatives remains challenging, with spectral and finite\ndifference methods introducing approximation errors due to finite resolution.\nHere, we propose the mollified graph neural operator ($m$GNO), the first method\nto leverage automatic differentiation and compute exact gradients on arbitrary\ngeometries. This enhancement enables efficient training on irregular grids and\nvarying geometries while allowing seamless evaluation of physics losses at\nrandomly sampled points for improved generalization. For a PDE example on\nregular grids, $m$GNO paired with autograd reduced the L2 relative data error\nby 20x compared to finite differences, although training was slower. It can\nalso solve PDEs on unstructured point clouds seamlessly, using physics losses\nonly, at resolutions vastly lower than those needed for finite differences to\nbe accurate enough. On these unstructured point clouds, $m$GNO leads to errors\nthat are consistently 2 orders of magnitude lower than machine learning\nbaselines (Meta-PDE, which accelerates PINNs) for comparable runtimes, and also\ndelivers speedups from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the numerical\nsolver for similar accuracy. $m$GNOs can also be used to solve inverse design\nand shape optimization problems on complex geometries.",

To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC\n(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model\ncombining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying\ndiscriminator.

However, due to the high training cost and inconsistencies in learned\nrepresentations, there is significant interest in facilitating communication\nbetween representations and ensuring compatibility across independently trained\nneural networks.

A key\nchallenge is adapting the latent spaces of updated models to align with those\nof previous models on downstream distributions while preserving the newly\nlearned representation spaces.

This work answers the question of when and\nwhy TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian\ndistribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for\nfinite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference\nlatent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM\nunderestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM\nachieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing\nits advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis\nto Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the\nsampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.\nThe approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component\nmeans increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well\nseparated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update\nconverges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In\nsummary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has\nwell-separated modes and non-negligible variances.

Specifically, we propose a\nnoise-conditioned expert routing mechanism, a universal model based expert\nspecialization strategy, and an SNR-decaying curriculum learning protocol,\ncollectively improving model robustness and generalization under diverse noise\nconditions. The proposed method can automatically route inputs to expert\nnetworks based on noise information derived from the inputs, where each expert\ntargets distinct noise characteristics while preserving speaker identity\ninformation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate consistent superiority over\nbaselines, confirming that explicit noise-dependent feature modeling\nsignificantly enhances robustness without sacrificing verification accuracy.",

    "summary": "With the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things, video analytics has\nbecome a cornerstone application in wireless multimedia sensor networks. To\nsupport such applications under bandwidth constraints, learning-based adaptive\nquantization for video compression have demonstrated strong potential in\nreducing bitrate while maintaining analytical accuracy. However, existing\nframeworks often fail to fully exploit the fine-grained quality control enabled\nby modern blockbased video codecs, leaving significant compression efficiency\nuntapped.\n  In this paper, we present How2Compress, a simple yet effective framework\ndesigned to enhance video compression efficiency through precise, fine-grained\nquality control at the macroblock level. How2Compress is a plug-and-play module\nand can be seamlessly integrated into any existing edge video analytics\npipelines. We implement How2Compress on the H.264 codec and evaluate its\nperformance across diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that\nHow2Compress achieves up to $50.4\\%$ bitrate savings and outperforms baselines\nby up to $3.01\\times$ without compromising accuracy, demonstrating its\npractical effectiveness and efficiency.

    "summary": "Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in\nembodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end,\nAudio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to\nidentify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with\nsynchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However,\nthis paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping\nfrom 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation,\nwe introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending\nthe existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due\nto variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse\nacoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we\ncreate the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing\nphotorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under\nsingle-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object\ncategories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to\ngenerate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and\ncorresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet,\ncharacterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D\naudio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene\nrepresentation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment\nsounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant\nadvancement in the field of embodied AI.

    "summary": "Global illumination (GI) is essential for realistic rendering but remains\ncomputationally expensive due to the complexity of simulating indirect light\ntransport. Recent neural methods have mainly relied on per-scene optimization,\nsometimes extended to handle changes in camera or geometry. Efforts toward\ncross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as\nneural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view\ninconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D\nlight transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from\n3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each\nscene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A\nscalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these\nfeatures into neural primitives. At render time, each query point retrieves\nnearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregates their latent\nfeatures through cross-attention to predict the desired rendering quantity. We\ndemonstrate results on diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse\nindoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding\ntrained for irradiance estimation can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks\nwith limited fine-tuning. We also present preliminary results for\nspatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and show how\nthe normalized field can accelerate unbiased path guiding.

In these scenarios,\nprecision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking is key. With this\nmotivation, we develop a distributed model-predictive controller (MPC) for\nmulti-vehicle cargo operations that builds on the precise path-tracking of\nlidar teach and repeat. To carry cargo, a following vehicle must maintain a\nEuclidean distance offset from a lead vehicle regardless of the path curvature.\nOur approach uses a shared map to localize the robots relative to each other\nwithout GNSS or direct observations. We compare our approach to a centralized\nMPC and a baseline approach that directly measures the inter-vehicle distance.\nThe distributed MPC shows equivalent nominal performance to the more complex\ncentralized MPC. Using a direct measurement of the relative distance between\nthe leader and follower shows improved tracking performance in close-range\nscenarios but struggles with long-range offsets. The operational flexibility\nprovided by distributing the computation makes it well suited for real\ndeployments. We evaluate four types of convoyed path trackers with over 10 km\nof driving in a coupled convoy. With convoys of two and three rovers, the\nproposed distributed MPC method works in real-time to allow map-based convoying\nto maintain maximum spacing within 20 cm of the target in various conditions.",

    "summary": "A fundamental aspect for building intelligent autonomous robots that can\nassist humans in their daily lives is the construction of rich environmental\nrepresentations. While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched\nrobotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between\nspatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event\nwashing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a\nframework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This\nrepresentation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex\nspatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's\ncapability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human\ninquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG\nframework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at:\nhttps://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/EGG.",

Current multimodal foundation based\napproaches, despite their capabilities, typically fail to decompose high-level\ncommands into executable action sequences from static visual input alone. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce Super-Mimic, a hierarchical framework that\nenables zero-shot robotic imitation by directly inferring procedural intent\nfrom unscripted human demonstration videos. Our framework is composed of two\nsequential modules. First, a Human Intent Translator (HIT) parses the input\nvideo using multimodal reasoning to produce a sequence of language-grounded\nsubtasks.

The resulting visual trajectories are dynamics-aware,\nexplicitly modeling crucial object interactions and contact points to guide the\nlow-level controller. We validate this approach through extensive experiments\non a suite of long-horizon manipulation tasks, where Super-Mimic significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by over 20%.

Computational distance\nlearning predicts the computational complexity between two states, enabling the\nsystem to identify the temporally closest subgoal from a disturbed state.\nObject reduction minimizes the set of active objects considered during\nreplanning, further improving efficiency.

Second, we design and implement a HIL platform centered around a\nunified spatiotemporal measurement core to support this process, ensuring\nconsistent and traceable quantification of physical motion and system timing.\nFinally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution through\ncomprehensive experiments. The platform itself was first validated, achieving a\nspatial accuracy of 10.27 mm RMSE and a stable closed-loop latency baseline of\napproximately 45 ms.

Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of\nkeypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage\ncontrol offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile,\nrecent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to\nrender an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide\ndrone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated\nimage sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve\nreconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of\ndrones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage\ncontroller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety\nconstraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon\nalgorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are\ninterpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback\nto update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The\neffectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and\nexperiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that\nincorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D\nreconstructions than conventional methods.

    "summary": "Information sharing is critical in time-sensitive and realistic multi-robot\nexploration, especially for smaller robotic teams in large-scale environments\nwhere connectivity may be sparse and intermittent. Existing methods often\noverlook such communication constraints by assuming unrealistic global\nconnectivity. Other works account for communication constraints (by maintaining\nclose proximity or line of sight during information exchange), but are often\ninefficient. For instance, preplanned rendezvous approaches typically involve\nunnecessary detours resulting from poorly timed rendezvous, while pursuit-based\napproaches often result in short-sighted decisions due to their greedy nature.\nWe present IR2, a deep reinforcement learning approach to information sharing\nfor multi-robot exploration. Leveraging attention-based neural networks trained\nvia reinforcement and curriculum learning, IR2 allows robots to effectively\nreason about the longer-term trade-offs between disconnecting for solo\nexploration and reconnecting for information sharing. In addition, we propose a\nhierarchical graph formulation to maintain a sparse yet informative graph,\nenabling our approach to scale to large-scale environments. We present\nsimulation results in three large-scale Gazebo environments, which show that\nour approach yields 6.6-34.1% shorter exploration paths when compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines, and lastly deploy our learned policy on hardware.\nOur simulation training and testing code is available at\nhttps://ir2-explore.github.io.",

    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) evolve, their integration with 3D spatial\ndata (3D-LLMs) has seen rapid progress, offering unprecedented capabilities for\nunderstanding and interacting with physical spaces. This survey provides a\ncomprehensive overview of the methodologies enabling LLMs to process,\nunderstand, and generate 3D data. Highlighting the unique advantages of LLMs,\nsuch as in-context learning, step-by-step reasoning, open-vocabulary\ncapabilities, and extensive world knowledge, we underscore their potential to\nsignificantly advance spatial comprehension and interaction within embodied\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Our investigation spans various 3D data\nrepresentations, from point clouds to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). It\nexamines their integration with LLMs for tasks such as 3D scene understanding,\ncaptioning, question-answering, and dialogue, as well as LLM-based agents for\nspatial reasoning, planning, and navigation. The paper also includes a brief\nreview of other methods that integrate 3D and language. The meta-analysis\npresented in this paper reveals significant progress yet underscores the\nnecessity for novel approaches to harness the full potential of 3D-LLMs. Hence,\nwith this paper, we aim to chart a course for future research that explores and\nexpands the capabilities of 3D-LLMs in understanding and interacting with the\ncomplex 3D world.

This design significantly enhances both\ntemporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene\nunderstanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves\nspatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations\nfor future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.\nAdditionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects\nspatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on\ndynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.\nExtensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in\naction-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving\ngeneration quality with 4.4$\\times$ faster inference.

    "summary": "Fruit harvesting remains predominantly a labor-intensive process, motivating\nthe development of research for robotic grippers. Conventional rigid or\nvacuum-driven grippers require complex mechanical design or high energy\nconsumption. Current enveloping-based fruit harvesting grippers lack\nadaptability to fruits of different sizes. This paper introduces a\ndrawstring-inspired, cable-driven soft gripper for versatile and gentle fruit\nharvesting. The design employs 3D-printed Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)\npockets with integrated steel wires that constrict around the fruit when\nactuated, distributing pressure uniformly to minimize bruising and allow\nversatility to fruits of varying sizes. The lightweight structure, which\nrequires few components, reduces mechanical complexity and cost compared to\nother grippers. Actuation is achieved through servo-driven cable control, while\nmotor feedback provides autonomous grip adjustment with tunable grip strength.\nExperimental validation shows that, for tomatoes within the gripper's effective\nsize range, harvesting was achieved with a 0% immediate damage rate and a\nbruising rate of less than 9% after five days, reinforcing the gripper's\nsuitability for fruit harvesting.",

We consider $ m\\geq 2$, and the multi-robot coordination is achieved\nvia non-Euclidean metrics.

These couplings not only influence the on-manifold\nmaneuvering of robots, but also pose significant challenges to the further\ndesign of the ordering-flexible coordination via non-Euclidean metrics.\n  To tackle this issue, we first identify a feasible solution of auxiliary\nvectors such that the last $m$ entries of the propagation term are effectively\ndecoupled to be the same constant. Then, we redesign the coordinated GVF (CGVF)\nalgorithm to {\\it boost} the advantages of singularities elimination and global\nconvergence by treating $m$ manifold parameters as additional $m$ virtual\ncoordinates.

    "summary": "Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires\nreal-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible,\ncollision-free, and satisfy state or actuator constraints. Modern trajectory\nplanning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the\nsystematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy\nvarious constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and\nthe risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based\nplanners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free\nplanning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments\ntogether with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal\ntrajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based\nplanners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic\ndevelopments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation\ntesting is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up\nSTITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art\noptimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be\ncreated within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m\nx 50 m environments.

    "summary": "Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information\nto operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but\ntheir high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.\nThis challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which\ngenerate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are\ninherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To\novercome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches\nhave explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are\nsignificantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map\nconstruction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD\nmaps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach\nintroduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we\nincorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but\nadditional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this\nway, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the\ndependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,\nwe introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element\nidentifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on\nArgoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up\nto +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP\n(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

    "summary": "Achieving persistent tracking of multiple dynamic targets over a large\nspatial area poses significant challenges for a single-robot system with\nconstrained sensing capabilities. As the robot moves to track different\ntargets, the ones outside the field of view accumulate uncertainty, making them\nprogressively harder to track. An effective path planning algorithm must manage\nuncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing\ntrack of targets that remain unseen for too long. However, most existing\napproaches rely on short planning horizons and assume small, bounded\nenvironments, resulting in poor tracking performance and target loss in\nlarge-scale scenarios. In this paper, we present a hierarchical planner for\ntracking multiple moving targets with an aerial vehicle. To address the\nchallenge of tracking non-static targets, our method incorporates motion models\nand uncertainty propagation during path execution, allowing for more informed\ndecision-making. We decompose the multi-target tracking task into sub-tasks of\nsingle target search and detection, and our proposed pipeline consists a novel\nlow-level coverage planner that enables searching for a target in an evolving\nbelief area, and an estimation method to assess the likelihood of success for\neach sub-task, making it possible to convert the active target tracking task to\na Markov decision process (MDP) that we solve with a tree-based algorithm to\ndetermine the sequence of sub-tasks. We validate our approach in simulation,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing planners for active target\ntracking tasks, and our proposed planner outperforms existing approaches,\nachieving a reduction of 11-70% in final uncertainty across different\nenvironments.",
