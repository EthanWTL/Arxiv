    "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models\n(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they\nstill face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,\nsuch as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.\nMost LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while\nmultimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack\nthe necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we\npropose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for \"thinking\nwith images\" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text\nreasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into\nimages as \"visual thought\", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we\nfirst construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark\nfor Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.\nSecond, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art\nimage-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures\ninto codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model\nfor solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model\nachieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully\nvalidating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our\nwork opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides\nthe community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and\nstrong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our\ndatasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.",

    "summary": "The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional\nambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional\nsubmanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with\nprogressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this\nprocess -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,\nand are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.\nFor a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively\nexpect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic\ndimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari\net al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID\nto the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to\nthe amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID\nestimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify\nthe complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,\nadversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete\nsince Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly\nunrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap\nby formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.\nAdditionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions\nare replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.",

    "summary": "Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in\nneural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts\nof the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity\nto non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial\nvulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.\nSpecifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more\nfeatures than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent\nrepresentations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial\nperturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack\npatterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a\nmechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack\ntransferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific\nvulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled\nsuperposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial\nvulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained\non CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct\nof networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning\nprocess or non-robust inputs.",

    "summary": "Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising\nresults, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain\nunderexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based\napproaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative\npretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals\nwithin a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through\nanalysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm\nthat latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve\nas a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a\nLanguage-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its\neffectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.\nFurthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),\nshowing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive\nrefinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This\nsuggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm\nfor enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of\nGRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on\nits representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource\nvisual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining\nbefore CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding\ncapabilities.

    "summary": "Learning robotic manipulation policies directly in the real world can be\nexpensive and time-consuming. While reinforcement learning (RL) policies\ntrained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real\ntransfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise\ndynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL\npipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter\nestimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our\napproach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric\nreconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions\nover physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from\ninteraction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical\nparameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based\nuncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying\ncenter of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution,\nPhys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization\nbaseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23%\nin the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion\nfor hammer pushing.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language\nmodels, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of\nnovel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In\nthis paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly\nincentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to\nunderstand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our\nmain finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,\nrepresentation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden\nstates significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for\npost-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For\ninference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves\nefficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and\nreasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%\nimprovement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we\nshow that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves\nreasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL\npost-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained\nQwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,\ndemonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency.

    "summary": "A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large\nlanguage models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood\nfunctions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating\ncorresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods\napproximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via\ncustomized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all\nMC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms\nin the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint\nrestricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations\nand ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose \\emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient\nRL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the\nELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key\nproperties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term\ndepends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation\nacross samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the\nvalue and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based\nobjective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for\nthe original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC\nsample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved\nRL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.\nExperiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for\ndLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.",

    "title": "Breaking the Compression Ceiling: Data-Free Pipeline for Ultra-Efficient\n  Delta Compression",
    "summary": "With the rise of the fine-tuned-pretrained paradigm, storing numerous\nfine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta\ncompression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly\ncompressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained\nmodel weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high\ncompression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these\nchallenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression\npipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance.\nUltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and\nstabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions,\nusing three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation\nassigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance\nlayers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression\napplies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by\ngroup-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3)\nTrace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a\nglobal rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression.\nExtensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2\n7B and 13B) with up to 50x compression, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base,\nT5-base) with up to 224x compression, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14)\nwith up to 132x compression, and (d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 18x\ncompression, demonstrate that UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing\nmethods, especially under ultra-high compression.

Most existing approaches lack transparency in\ntheir decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We\nintroduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking\nthrough a confidence-weighted voting mechanism.

    "summary": "With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)\nmethods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.\nHowever, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical\nlimitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\\texttt{pass@1024}$), many\nexisting base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math\nbenchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL\nfine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen\nexisting solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such\nsharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster\nexploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we\nintroduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat\ncommon open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling\nbudgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that\nlearn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated\nsampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and\nDeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school\nmath. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as\nNemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform\npoorly on MATH-B at $\\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall\nshort on tackling harder instances.

EAPrivacy utilizes procedurally generated scenarios across\nfour tiers to test an agent's ability to handle sensitive objects, adapt to\nchanging environments, balance task execution with privacy constraints, and\nresolve conflicts with social norms.

Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural\nLanguage (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the\npotential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However,\nRL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base\nmodel, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math\nreasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent\ndisparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning (NFL-HR)**, an\nend-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math\nproblem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the NL-FL\nProblem Alignment method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA)\nproblems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the Mixed Problem\nInput technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and\nexistence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output\nformat gap in reasoning through an LLM-based Answer Extraction mechanism.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that the NFL-HR framework achieves\n**89.80**% and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC\nbenchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by **4.60%** and **4.82%**,\nrespectively.

    "summary": "Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich\nfeatures through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of\nlocal patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face\nsignificant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can\nbe oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we\npropose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel\nneighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors\n(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables\nNV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target\nentities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector\nextraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector\ndensity-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination\nof up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied\nelement-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and\nvalue and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention\nmechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated\nsuperior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial\nshapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%\nmean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%\nand 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in\ncar detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of\nvoxels being filtered out.",

    "summary": "We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating\nmultifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of\ninvasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually\nspecifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable\nsimilarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of\nscientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that\nproduces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to\nmap semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space.\nWe then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified\nembedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a\nscientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we\nintroduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into\nnatural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show\nthat this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in\nlow-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability\nin user-centric settings.",

We posit that the current publication speeds in AI\ncombined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility\nprotocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful\npolicy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt\nstricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve\nconsensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility\ncrisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific\ndomains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased\nstatistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can\nenable effective AI governance.

Leveraging recent advances in deep learning, neural network-based\ndecoders have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reliability of\nQEC. We propose the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), a novel and\ngeneral decoding framework that explicitly leverages the structural graph of\nstabilizer codes to learn error correlations across multiple scales. Our\narchitecture first computes attention locally on structurally related groups of\nstabilizers and then systematically merges these qubit-centric representations\nto build a global view of the error syndrome. The proposed HQMT achieves\nsubstantially lower logical error rates for surface codes by integrating a\ndedicated qubit-merging layer within the transformer architecture. Across\nvarious code distances, HQMT significantly outperforms previous neural\nnetwork-based QEC decoders as well as a powerful belief propagation with\nordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) baseline. This hierarchical approach\nprovides a scalable and effective framework for surface code decoding,\nadvancing the realization of reliable quantum computing.",

As requirements grow, these\ndocuments expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates\ndeveloping internalization methods that embed policy documents into model\npriors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets\ngeneric prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels\nand require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce\nCC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four\nlevels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity\nand offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our\nanalysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose\nmajor reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent\ninteraction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy\ncomplexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose\nCategory-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline\nparses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into\nfactual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex\nconditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis\nand enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive\npretraining loss.

To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an\nevolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional\nexpression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a\nMarkov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to\nevolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios.

Empirical analyses across multiple Transformer\narchitectures reveal consistent links between these latent dynamics and text\nquality: smoother trajectories correspond to greater fluency, and richer\ntopological organization correlates with enhanced coherence. Different models\nexhibit distinct dynamical regimes, reflecting diverse strategies of semantic\norganization in latent space. Moreover, decoding parameters such as temperature\nand top-$p$ shape these trajectories in predictable ways, defining a balanced\nregion that harmonizes fluency and creativity. As a phenomenological rather\nthan first-principles framework, DMET provides a unified and testable\nperspective for interpreting, monitoring, and guiding LLM behavior, offering\nnew insights into the interplay between internal representation dynamics and\nexternal text generation quality.",

    "summary": "Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous\nnetworks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications,\nsuch as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality.\nHowever, most existing network control solutions target only average delay\nperformance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency\nguarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets\nwithin application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in\nMulti-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the\nDelay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem,\nand highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel\nMA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and\ndistributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical\nnetworking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based\non the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where\ncentralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths\nand schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby\nmaximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework\nallows integrating both data-driven \\blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)}\nagents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance\nbetween performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the\nsuperiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic\noptimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and\ninterplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both\nefficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently\ndemonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks.\nSimilar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies,\nRLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring\nnovel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In\nthis study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically\nprobing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various\nmodel families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning\nbenchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric.\nSurprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit\nfundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform\ntheir base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher\npass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the\nobserved reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model.\nTreating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that\nsix popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in\nleveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that\ndistillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and\ngenuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings\nsuggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to\nelicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for\nimproved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn\nagent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.",

    "summary": "Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental\nchallenge across science and engineering. Deep learning has shown remarkable\npotential for capturing complex system behavior, yet achieving models that are\nboth accurate and physically interpretable remains difficult. To address this,\nwe propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a framework\nthat integrates structured state-space modeling with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(KANs). Within a Neural ODE architecture, SKANODE employs a fully trainable KAN\nas a universal function approximator to perform virtual sensing, recovering\nlatent states that correspond to interpretable physical quantities such as\ndisplacements and velocities. Leveraging KAN's symbolic regression capability,\nSKANODE then extracts compact, interpretable expressions for the system's\ngoverning dynamics. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world systems\ndemonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior predictive accuracy, discovers\nphysics-consistent dynamics, and reveals complex nonlinear behavior. Notably,\nit identifies hysteretic behavior in an F-16 aircraft and recovers a concise\nsymbolic equation describing this phenomenon. SKANODE thus enables\ninterpretable, data-driven discovery of physically grounded models for complex\nnonlinear dynamical systems.",

    "summary": "Knowledge distillation enhances the performance of compact student networks\nby transferring knowledge from more powerful teacher networks without\nintroducing additional parameters. In the feature space, local regions within\nan individual global feature encode distinct yet interdependent semantic\ninformation. Previous feature-based distillation methods mainly emphasize\nglobal feature alignment while neglecting the decoupling of local regions\nwithin an individual global feature, which often results in semantic confusion\nand suboptimal performance. Moreover, conventional contrastive representation\ndistillation suffers from low efficiency due to its reliance on a large memory\nbuffer to store feature samples. To address these limitations, this work\nproposes MSDCRD, a model-agnostic distillation framework that systematically\ndecouples global features into multi-scale local features and leverages the\nresulting semantically rich feature samples with tailored sample-wise and\nfeature-wise contrastive losses. This design enables efficient distillation\nusing only a single batch, eliminating the dependence on external memory.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MSDCRD achieves superior performance not\nonly in homogeneous teacher-student settings but also in heterogeneous\narchitectures where feature discrepancies are more pronounced, highlighting its\nstrong generalization capability.",

The MF-RIS plays a\npivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of low-Earth orbit (LEO)\nsatellites operating in the shadowed regions, while accounting for both\ncommunication and computing energy consumption across the SAGIN nodes. To\nmaximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE) of IoT devices, we formulate a\njoint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including signal\namplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element\nselection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude\nplatform station (HAPS) deployment, IoT device association, and computing\ncapability.

But real life also pushes human intelligence along a\ndifferent frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making\nproblems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice\ngameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem\nsettings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how\nthey play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how\nfun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these\ncapacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the \"Intuitive\nGamer\". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited)\ngoal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo\ntree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few\nstochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep\nsearch. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000\nparticipants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our\nparticipants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions\nvarying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no\nexperience at all (\"just thinking\"), to a single round of play, to indirect\nexperience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and\ndoes so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level\nmodels.

    "summary": "Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline\nreinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,\nmulti-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,\niterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while\nfast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded\nperformance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this\ngap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,\nlies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including\ndiffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of\nlearning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer\ndesign space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative\nTrajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns\nthe entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical\nfor offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled\nadaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative\npolicies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.",

    "summary": "Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing,\ninvolving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to\nprepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the\ncontext-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually\nignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to\ntheir ability to take context into account without requiring extensive\nlanguage-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on\nweb-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword\nremoval, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple\ntext classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates\nthat LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal,\nlemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%,\nrespectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts\npreprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the\n$F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques.

    "summary": "Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of\nreusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid\ngeneralization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,\nincluding meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers\nand more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they\nencode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context\nexamples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such\nmethods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as\ninitializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they\nincorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes\namortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on\nwhether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.\nBuilding on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most\nmethods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process\ntask data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address\nthis, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine\nsolutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic\noptimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with\nforward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and\nextensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.",

Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves\nretrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive\nreasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite\ntheir clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and\nabduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in\nisolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for\nDeductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion\nmodel capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and\nconclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction\nfor hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a\nself-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates\ncandidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover\nricher logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement\nlearning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling\nthe model to explore novel reasoning compositions.

    "summary": "Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is\na critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised\nreinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often\npropagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While\nprocess-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they\nlack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific\nsegmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the\nDimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges\nthe gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning\nprocess along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:\nConfidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and\nCoherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects\nbeyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without\nrequiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides\neffective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances\ntheir reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves\nconsistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain\ntasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.\nOur findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning\nprocess can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the\ntraining distribution.",

Yet recent research\nshows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in\nfive cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to\nfully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques\nthat require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL\nthat strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility\nboundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework\ncombines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and\nclassifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based\nrewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through\ninternal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens\nconsistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.\nIn experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved\nself-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic\nbenchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external\nsupervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,\noutperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially\nunlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge\nawareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer\ndeployment in critical applications.

    "summary": "Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks\nsuch as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on\ntextual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for\nreadability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable\nreward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with\nstronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose\nDocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their\nstructure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired\ndocuments, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-\nand low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure\nand style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,\nand in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the\nBradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict\nthe annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a\ntest dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human\nevaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6\nand 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over\nbaselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward\nachieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%\nwin rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward\nproducing human-preferred documents.",

    "summary": "We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process\nmedical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP\nprojections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with\nrespect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation\npatching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a\ncoarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,\ndiseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we\nfind that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's\nlayers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often\nencoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate\nlayers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is\nnon-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in\nLlama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism\nof action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B\nhave activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final\nlayers.

    "summary": "Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow\nmatching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However,\ndistribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can\nstill cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early\nfailure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots\nin human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general\nframework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that\ndoes not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending\nfailure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network\ndistillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in\ngenerated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure\nprediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via\nconformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,\naggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER\nacross five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure\nmodes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures\nfrom benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier\nthan existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards\nmore interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos\nare available at https://tum-lsy.github.io/fiper_website.",

Moreover, even under identical conditions,\nthe routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated\nforward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout\nRouting Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the\ninference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces\ntraining-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies\nwithout compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings\nconfirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and\noutperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS.

    "summary": "Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing\nones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in\nLLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with\nRL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue\nthat RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.\nThis work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills\nduring RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms\nby which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination\nand other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task\ncomplexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.\nSpecifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string\ntransformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g\nprior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen\ncompositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability\ngeneralizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions\nunseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that\ncompositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target\ntask. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,\nrequiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative\nanalysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the\nmodels. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of\nthese findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM\nlearning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,\nthen using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex\nproblems.",

    "summary": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by\nincorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on\nrelevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,\ni.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and\ncomprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic\nattribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from\nthe same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension\nability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion\nof LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple\ndatasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal\nfor LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across\ndifferent LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the\nLLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some\nhuman-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific\nLLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for\nLLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,\nwe propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We\nevaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while\nverbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to\nassess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and\nto select truly useful ones for unknown queries.",

    "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node\nclassification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often\ndepends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world\nscenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive\ninformation, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.\nFurthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data\nleakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework\nthat enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting\nprivacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by\ndividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each\npropagating information independently through the graph topology. The\naggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This\nframework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves\nrobustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance\nutility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets\ndemonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node\nclassification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our\nanalysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations\nrather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility\nwithout compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further\nconfirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse\nscenarios.

    "summary": "Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of\nhigh-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have\nallowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can\naugment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like\nsemantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images\nfrom the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads\nto significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further\nsupervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when\ncompared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any\nstrict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene\nexperiment.",

Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource\nutilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training.

Furthermore, we implement several\npopular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve\nperformance on par with synchronous training.",

    "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate\nimpressive long-horizon reasoning capabilities. However, their reliance on\nstatic internal knowledge limits their performance on complex,\nknowledge-intensive tasks and hinders their ability to produce comprehensive\nresearch reports requiring synthesis of diverse web information. To address\nthis, we propose WebThinker, a deep research agent that empowers LRMs to\nautonomously search the web, navigate among web pages, and draft reports during\nthe reasoning process. WebThinker integrates a Deep Web Explorer module,\nenabling LRMs to dynamically search, navigate, and extract information from the\nweb when encountering knowledge gaps. It also employs an Autonomous\nThink-Search-and-Draft strategy, allowing the model to seamlessly interleave\nreasoning, information gathering, and report writing in real time. To further\nenhance research tool utilization, we introduce an RL-based training strategy\nvia iterative online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive\nexperiments on complex reasoning benchmarks (GPQA, GAIA, WebWalkerQA, HLE) and\nscientific report generation tasks (Glaive) demonstrate that WebThinker\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods and strong proprietary systems. Our\napproach enhances LRM reliability and applicability in complex scenarios,\npaving the way for more capable and versatile deep research systems.

(2) What form do these mechanisms\ntake? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first\nconstruct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit\ncomparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract\ncontext-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context\nencoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally\nimplement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal\nanalysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement\ninterventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the\nmodel's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local\ncomponents into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional\nexpression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65%\nemotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and\nsteering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic\nstudy to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights\ninto interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.",

    "summary": "Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even\nfor benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting\nrankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion\nto a growing ecosystem of competing models. In this paper, we take a different\nperspective on model comparison: instead of relying on out-of-the-box\nperformance via direct evaluation, we compare model potential by providing each\nmodel with identical benchmark-specific fine-tuning before evaluation. We call\nthis approach train-before-test. Our primary contribution is a comprehensive\nempirical evaluation of model potential across 24 benchmarks and 61 models.\nFirst, we demonstrate that model potential rankings obtained through\ntrain-before-test exhibit remarkable consistency across all benchmarks. Whereas\ntraditional rankings demonstrate little external validity under direct\nevaluation, they enjoy a significant degree of external validity when applying\ntrain-before-test: model potential rankings transfer gracefully from one\nbenchmark to another. Second, train-before-test restores the connection between\nperplexity and downstream task performance, lost under direct evaluation.\nRemarkably, even pre-finetuning perplexity of a base model predicts\npost-finetuning downstream performance, suggesting that ranking consistency\nreflects inherent model potential rather than fine-tuning artifacts. Finally,\ntrain-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to essentially rank one,\nindicating that model potential is dominated by one latent factor, uncovered by\ntrain-before-test. Our work supports the recommendation to make\ntrain-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.",

This paper presents the first comprehensive\ncost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with\nzero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on\n1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer\nelectronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership\nmodeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing\narchitecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%\naccuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing\na 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for\n100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond\n55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.\nZero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories\n(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare\nspecialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to\narchitectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes.

    "summary": "This paper proposes an agent-based approach toward a more natural interface\nbetween humans and machines. Large language models equipped with tools and the\ncommunication standard OPC UA are utilized to control machines in natural\nlanguage. Instead of touch interaction, which is currently the state-of-the-art\nmedium for interaction in operations, the proposed approach enables operators\nto talk or text with machines. This allows commands such as 'Please decrease\nthe temperature by 20 % in machine 1 and set the motor speed to 5000 rpm in\nmachine 2.' The large language model receives the user input and selects one of\nthree predefined tools that connect to an OPC UA server and either change or\nread the value of a node. Afterwards, the result of the tool execution is\npassed back to the language model, which then provides a final response to the\nuser. The approach is universally designed and can therefore be applied to any\nmachine that supports the OPC UA standard. The large language model is neither\nfine-tuned nor requires training data, only the relevant machine credentials\nand a parameter dictionary are included within the system prompt. The approach\nis evaluated on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller with four\nmachine parameters in a case study of fifty synthetically generated commands on\nfive different models. The results demonstrate high success rate, with\nproprietary GPT 5 models achieving accuracies between 96.0 % and 98.0 %, and\nopen-weight models reaching up to 90.0 %.

We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse\narchitectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms\n(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104\nexpert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and\nExtendedQA datasets. To assess generalizability, we additionally tested on an\nunseen internal dataset of 65 real-world radiology board examination questions.\nRaR significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting\nand conventional online RAG. The greatest gains occurred in small-scale models,\nwhile very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2%\nimprovement). Additionally, RaR retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%)\nand retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding\nfactual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from RaR\n(e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite\nembedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of RaR to\nenhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future\nstudies to validate their clinical utility. All datasets, code, and the full\nRaR framework are publicly available to support open research and clinical\ntranslation.",

    "summary": "While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in\nauto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its\npractical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods\nmitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.\nHowever, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due\nto per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially\nin long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning\nmodels, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.\nTo address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs\nexhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit\ndistinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.\nBuilding on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache\nretrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,\nLouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal\nlocality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing\ncomputation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,\nfine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input\nand output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's\nattention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.\nFurthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level\noptimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV\nclustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to\n4.7$\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while\nmaintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,\nincluding long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input\nlong-output scenarios.",

    "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are\ntraditionally evaluated in static, \"frozen world\" settings: model responses are\nassumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be\nimmutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for\nshort-term tasks, the \"frozen world\" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning\ntasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think\nthrough problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model\nstarts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the\nfrozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic\nscenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs\non a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to\nin-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require\nlong-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:\neven state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can\nfail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with\nperformance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the\nreasoning process.

In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning\nin agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and\nreasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic\ntrajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger\nSFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration\nand markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are\ncrucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and\nmaintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.\n(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool\ncalls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.\nTogether, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and\ntraining efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with\nsmaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL\nresearch. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a\nhigh-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL\ndataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the\nagentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including\nAIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6.

All\nquestions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo\nrigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and\nanswerable.

    "summary": "Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model\n(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches\ntypically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which\noften leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off\ncourse due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for\nsmaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we\nanalyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning\nand execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from\nincorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan\nAggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan\nexploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on\nthe token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them\ninto a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design\nin which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA\nmodule implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that\noutcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K\ntokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level\npreference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo\n(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields\nmore efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive\nexperiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks\ndemonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method\noutperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward\nRL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.",

However, the necessity of each of\nthese principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically\ndeconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax\nthese principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid\narchitectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical\nanalysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their\nabsence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical\nform and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when\npreserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in\nisolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard\nattention, highlighting a cooperative effect.

    "summary": "Many in-silico simulations of human survey responses with large language\nmodels (LLMs) focus on generating closed-ended survey responses, whereas LLMs\nare typically trained to generate open-ended text instead. Previous research\nhas used a diverse range of methods for generating closed-ended survey\nresponses with LLMs, and a standard practice remains to be identified. In this\npaper, we systematically investigate the impact that various Survey Response\nGeneration Methods have on predicted survey responses. We present the results\nof 32 mio. simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation\nMethods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models. We\nfind significant differences between the Survey Response Generation Methods in\nboth individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment. Our results show that\nRestricted Generation Methods perform best overall, and that reasoning output\ndoes not consistently improve alignment. Our work underlines the significant\nimpact that Survey Response Generation Methods have on simulated survey\nresponses, and we develop practical recommendations on the application of\nSurvey Response Generation Methods.",

    "summary": "Adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) aim to disrupt the\nmodel's ability of link prediction by removing or inserting triples. A recent\nblack-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural\ninformation to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate\nhuman-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past\nfew years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities\nin text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose\nLLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates\nhuman-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context\nunder limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that\nexplicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while\nincorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and\nhesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters,\nwhich compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of\nattack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both\nsemantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order\nadjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance\nfiltering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets\ndemonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and\nprovides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance\ncompared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies\nfurther validate its capability to generate explanations.",

    "summary": "Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs),\nsuch as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak\nattacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the\nmodels to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.\nThe powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and\nwill refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the\njailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,\nsuch as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.\nUnfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be\nextremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once\nhijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover\na surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template\ntokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful\nguardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we\nintroduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based\nguardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range\nfrom effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along\nwith the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve\nalarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different\nbenchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API\nservices).

To mitigate this risk, proprietary\nmodel providers often adopt aggressive protection strategies, such as replacing\ndetailed reasoning with brief summaries, which deprive users of valuable\nintermediate information. To address this trade-off, we propose PART, an\ninformation-preserving antidistillation reformulation of reasoning traces.\nMotivated by the difference between how humans understand reasoning traces and\nhow LLMs exploit them for supervised fine-tuning, we design a simple but\neffective two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering\nsub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model is trained to perform this\nreformulation, incurring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PART consistently disrupts distillation across student models\nof different sizes and types on various reasoning benchmarks. For instance,\nwhen training on reformulated traces, even the performance of a large 32B\nstudent model decreases from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024, corresponding to a\n13.5% degradation.",

    "title": "GenCNER: A Generative Framework for Continual Named Entity Recognition",
    "summary": "Traditional named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify text mentions\ninto pre-defined entity types. Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is\nintroduced since entity categories are continuously increasing in various\nreal-world scenarios. However, existing continual learning (CL) methods for NER\nface challenges of catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift of non-entity\ntype. In this paper, we propose GenCNER, a simple but effective Generative\nframework for CNER to mitigate the above drawbacks. Specifically, we skillfully\nconvert the CNER task into sustained entity triplet sequence generation problem\nand utilize a powerful pre-trained seq2seq model to solve it. Additionally, we\ndesign a type-specific confidence-based pseudo labeling strategy along with\nknowledge distillation (KD) to preserve learned knowledge and alleviate the\nimpact of label noise at the triplet level. Experimental results on two\nbenchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings, and achieves the smallest\ngap compared with non-CL results.",

We instantiate the framework through HealthNotes, a benchmark of\n1.2K helpfulness-annotated health notes paired with a fine-tuned helpfulness\njudge. Experiments on fifteen LLMs reveal an overlooked loophole in current\nhelpfulness evaluation, where stylistic fluency is mistaken for factual\naccuracy, and demonstrate that our hierarchical evaluation and LLM-augmented\ngeneration jointly enhance factual precision and evidence utility.

However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play,\nyielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of\nsocial gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival\ntime or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To\naddress these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal\nWerewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens,\nand 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel\nstrategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies\nas ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as\nmultiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate\nstances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation,\nwhich assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This\nframework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning\ncapabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent\ngameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse\nperformance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in\ndeception and counterfactual reasoning.

    "summary": "Individuals with intellectual disabilities often have difficulties in\ncomprehending complex texts. While many text-to-image models prioritize\naesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate\nto text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a\nstructured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating\naccessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates,\ni.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level\nDetail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while\nadhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial\nseparation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications\nfrom four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and\nASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template\neffectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of\ngenerated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts.\nResults show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest\nsemantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language\naccessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most\naccessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator\nagreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong\nreliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework\noffers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores\nthe importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility\ntools.",

    "summary": "Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,\nwhere emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing\napproaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to\ngeneralize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose\nEvaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time\nfake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process\naccording to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a\nsequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)\nEvidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into\ndecision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)\nReasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is\nadequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates\nsentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the\naccuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo\nlabels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge\nthrough interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the\nevaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable\nevaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.\nMoreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news\nfor evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves\ngeneralization to real-time news.

Our core contribution lies in converting all\njudgment tasks for non-verifiable and verifiable prompts into a unified format\nwith verifiable rewards, enabling direct optimization of evaluation quality\nwhile mitigating positional bias. We then use RL to train thinking-judges at\nscales of 8B, 32B, and 70B and show that they obtain state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple benchmarks. In particular, J1-Qwen-32B, our\nmultitasked pointwise and pairwise judge also outperforms o1-mini, o3, and a\nmuch larger 671B DeepSeek-R1 on some benchmarks, while only training on\nsynthetic data. Through comprehensive ablations of pairwise, pointwise, and\nmultitask J1 variants, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across\nseed prompts, reward strategies, and training recipes. Qualitative analysis\nreveals that J1 develops systematic evaluation strategies, including dynamic\ncriteria generation, reference answer creation, iterative self-correction of\ninitial assessments, and feedback generation for low-quality responses.",

    "summary": "Drug discovery is a long, expensive, and complex process, relying heavily on\nhuman medicinal chemists, who can spend years searching the vast space of\npotential therapies. Recent advances in artificial intelligence for chemistry\nhave sought to expedite individual drug discovery tasks; however, there remains\na critical need for an intelligent agent that can navigate the drug discovery\nprocess. Towards this end, we introduce LIDDIA, an autonomous agent capable of\nintelligently navigating the drug discovery process in silico. By leveraging\nthe reasoning capabilities of large language models, LIDDIA serves as a\nlow-cost and highly-adaptable tool for autonomous drug discovery. We\ncomprehensively examine LIDDIA , demonstrating that (1) it can generate\nmolecules meeting key pharmaceutical criteria on over 70% of 30 clinically\nrelevant targets, (2) it intelligently balances exploration and exploitation in\nthe chemical space, and (3) it identifies one promising novel candidate on\nAR/NR3C4, a critical target for both prostate and breast cancers.

    "summary": "With the growing accessibility and wide adoption of large language models,\nconcerns about their safety and alignment with human values have become\nparamount. In this paper, we identify a concerning phenomenon:\nReasoning-Induced Misalignment (RIM), in which misalignment emerges when\nreasoning capabilities strengthened-particularly when specific types of\nreasoning patterns are introduced during inference or training. Beyond\nreporting this vulnerability, we provide the first mechanistic account of its\norigins. Through representation analysis, we discover that specific attention\nheads facilitate refusal by reducing their attention to CoT tokens, a mechanism\nthat modulates the model's rationalization process during inference. During\ntraining, we find significantly higher activation entanglement between\nreasoning and safety in safety-critical neurons than in control neurons,\nparticularly after fine-tuning with those identified reasoning patterns. This\nentanglement strongly correlates with catastrophic forgetting, providing a\nneuron-level explanation for RIM.",

    "summary": "Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs\nin large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these\ntests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when\napplied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and\nvalidity of human psychometric tests for three constructs: sexism, racism, and\nmorality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt\nvariations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing\ntheory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing\nthe alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream\ntasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in\nsome cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks,\nindicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic\nevaluations of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their\nscores. They also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be\napplied directly to LLMs without adaptation.",

While models display impressive accuracy on factual\nquestion-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex\nqueries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,\nwe introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a\ncontrolled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual\nquestions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex\nqueries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic\nmisalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further\nuncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive\ncorrect or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through\nmechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model\ninternals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict\nshort-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes\nfactual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'\ntrustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly\nassume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in\nmore complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.",

    "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT)\nexplanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision\nprocess, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations\nrarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to\nformats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual\nquestion answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and\nimage modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution,\nand confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist\ncorrelations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes,\nwith strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\\tau_b=0.670$), moderate\nalignment for fidelity ($\\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone\n($\\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows\nthat answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging\ninjected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more\nthan visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy,\nproprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on\nfidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to\nevaluate beyond final answer accuracy.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of\ntool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of\nan LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively\ntrained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training\ndomain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning\ndomains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical\ntasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,\nenabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this\ncross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning\n(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill\nmigration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts\ndomain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,\nfostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system\nthat decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool\nefficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across\ndomain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,\ntool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and\ncoherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse\nbenchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and\nhighlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.",

This means that the linear\nclassification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns\ninto the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art\nXMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we\nshow can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and\ncomputational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically\nretain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose\nELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and\nFloat8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we\ndemonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,\nwithout relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.\nLow-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --\ngradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory\nusage.

    "summary": "Hate speech poses a serious threat to social cohesion and individual\nwell-being, particularly on social media, where it spreads rapidly. While\nresearch on hate speech detection has progressed, it remains largely focused on\nEnglish, resulting in limited resources and benchmarks for low-resource\nlanguages. Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic\nvarieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time,\nlarge language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably,\na requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we\naddress these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for\nEuropean Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This\ncollection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing\nresources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and\nscalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it\ninto European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent\nwith Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with\nPortuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we\nestablish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages. We\nevaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and\nfine-tuning settings, providing baseline results for future research. Moreover,\nwe perform a cross-lingual analysis with our target languages. Our findings\nunderscore the importance of multilingual and variety-aware approaches in hate\nspeech detection and offer a foundation for improved benchmarking in\nunderrepresented European languages.",

This method provides numerous benefits,\nincluding fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed\nto zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training\nin such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information\nretrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text\ninstance is \"similar\" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label\nis determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art\nsentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text\ninstance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary\nclassification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon\nprevious literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and\nevaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based\nclassification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the\nsemantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,\nand label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic\nmulti-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity\ndistributions show statistically significant differences across models,\ndatasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing\nlabel-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific\nthresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5\nthresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work\nby an average of 14%.

    "summary": "Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences through\nfinetuning is resource-intensive, motivating lightweight alternatives at test\ntime. We address test-time alignment through the lens of sequential decision\nmaking, a perspective that reveals two fundamental challenges. When actions are\ndefined at the token level, as in guided decoding, alignment suffers from the\ncurse of horizon. Conversely, when actions are at the response level, as in\ntraditional iterative refinement, the curse of dimensionality emerges. To\nresolve this trade-off, we draw inspiration from Model Predictive Control (MPC)\nin control theory to propose Textual Model Predictive Control (TMPC), a novel\npredictive planning framework adapted for aligning LLMs at inference time. A\nkey limitation of standard MPC is its reliance on predefined, hard segment\nboundaries, which are often absent in text generation. TMPC overcomes this by\nintroducing two principles inspired by hierarchical reinforcement learning: (1)\nHindsight Subgoal Identification, where TMPC analyzes generation subgoals to\nretrospectively identify high-reward intermediate outputs as subgoals. This\nallows the framework to discover meaningful, task-specific planning steps\n(e.g., a sentence in machine translation or a bug fix in code generation.). (2)\nSubgoal-Conditioned Re-Generation, where these identified subgoals are used to\nguide subsequent planning iterations. By conditioning on these proven,\nhigh-quality subgoals, TMPC ensures stable improvement by building upon\npreviously validated successes. TMPC is evaluated on three tasks with distinct\nsegmentation properties: discourse-level translation, long-form response\ngeneration, and program synthesis. The results demonstrate that TMPC\nconsistently improves performance, highlighting the generality.",

    "summary": "Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large\nlanguage model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact\nrepresentations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on\nautoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress\ncontextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to\nacquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a\nfundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge\nfrom actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial\nfor real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel\nmethod that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture\nthat is equipped with this compression capability \\textit{a priori}. Instead of\ntraining models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly\nselects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates\ncontextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving\nrepresentations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need\nfor autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly\nleveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor\nembeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)\nbidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture\ninformation from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC\nconsistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various\ncompression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves\n1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing\nadvantages at higher compression ratios.",

To generate high-quality spotlights, we propose a two-stage approach:\nfine-tuning a large language model on our benchmark data, followed by alignment\nvia Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

    "summary": "Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to\nmitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating\nvision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional\nsafeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to\npreempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM\nsafety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce\nVLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a\nreasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to\ndeliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures\nwithout altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a\nthree-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter\nto infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic\nrefusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal\nthat VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1\nachieves a remarkable 43.59\\% increase in average safety across five models on\nthe SIUO benchmark.",

    "summary": "Generative LLM have achieved remarkable success in various industrial\napplications, owing to their promising In-Context Learning capabilities.\nHowever, the issue of long context in complex tasks poses a significant barrier\nto their wider adoption, manifested in two main aspects: (i) The excessively\nlong context leads to high costs and inference delays. (ii) A substantial\namount of task-irrelevant information introduced by long contexts exacerbates\nthe \"lost in the middle\" problem. Existing methods compress context by removing\nredundant tokens using metrics such as self-information or PPL, which is\ninconsistent with the objective of retaining the most important tokens when\nconditioning on a given query. In this study, we introduce information\nbottleneck theory (IB) to model the problem, offering a novel perspective that\nthoroughly addresses the essential properties required for context compression.\nAdditionally, we propose a cross-attention-based approach to approximate mutual\ninformation in IB, which can be flexibly replaced with suitable alternatives in\ndifferent scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that\nour method achieves a 25% increase in compression rate compared to the\nstate-of-the-art, while maintaining question answering performance. In\nparticular, the context compressed by our method even outperform the full\ncontext in some cases.",

    "summary": "Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a\ntraining bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference\noptimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model\nannotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative,\nnon-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance.\nFurthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in\napproximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the\nlowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its\nlowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than\nlocating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided\nReasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a\nconfidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's\nreasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path\nguidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models\napplied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks.

    "summary": "Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)\nlearners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as\nEnglish and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate\nvocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to\ngenerate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's\nfirst language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most methods\nstill rely on direct IPA-based phonetic matching or employ LLMs without\nphonological guidance. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel\ncross-lingual mnemonic generation system that performs IPA-based phonological\nadaptation and syllable-aware alignment to retrieve L1 keyword sequence and\nuses LLMs to generate verbal cues. We evaluate PhoniTale through automated\nmetrics and a short-term recall test with human participants, comparing its\noutput to human-written and prior automated mnemonics. Our findings show that\nPhoniTale consistently outperforms previous automated approaches and achieves\nquality comparable to human-written mnemonics.",

    "summary": "Human infants rapidly develop visual reasoning skills from minimal input,\nsuggesting that developmentally inspired pretraining could significantly\nenhance the efficiency of vision-language models (VLMs). Although recent\nefforts have leveraged infant-inspired datasets like SAYCam, existing\nevaluation benchmarks remain misaligned--they are either too simplistic,\nnarrowly scoped, or tailored for large-scale pretrained models. Additionally,\ntraining exclusively on infant data overlooks the broader, diverse input from\nwhich infants naturally learn. To address these limitations, we propose\nBabyVLM, a novel framework comprising comprehensive in-domain evaluation\nbenchmarks and a synthetic training dataset created via child-directed\ntransformations of existing datasets. We demonstrate that VLMs trained with our\nsynthetic dataset achieve superior performance on BabyVLM tasks compared to\nmodels trained solely on SAYCam or general-purpose data of the SAYCam size.\nBabyVLM thus provides a robust, developmentally aligned evaluation tool and\nillustrates how compact models trained on carefully curated data can generalize\neffectively, opening pathways toward data-efficient vision-language learning\nparadigms.",

    "summary": "While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge\nmastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student\ndialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a\nsuitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's\ndifficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To\novercome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted\nthe initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to\ndesign a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique\ngraph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant\nknowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our\nknowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue\nsetting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM\nnot only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the\nresults' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for\nassessing students' cognitive states.

To evaluate model performance in doctor-facing applications, we\nintroduce DoctorFLAN-test (550 single-turn Q&A items) and DotaBench (74\nmulti-turn conversations). Experimental results with over ten popular LLMs\ndemonstrate that DoctorFLAN notably improves the performance of open-source\nLLMs in medical contexts, facilitating their alignment with physician workflows\nand complementing existing patient-oriented models.

Directly using such\nrationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training\nstability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,\na framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats\nLLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.\nThe framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust\nmetrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated\nrationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which\nassesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM\nAgreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics\nare integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training\nsamples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling\nreasoning-aware supervision.

    "title": "A Survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models",
    "summary": "With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,\nresearch community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,\npassive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and\ngeneralizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and\nits potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on\nAgentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we\nexplore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual\nfoundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based\nagents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along\nthree fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as\nthe system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through\nreasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,\nwhereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their\nproblem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)\nAgentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or\nphysical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and\nsustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further\naccelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source\ntraining frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic\nMLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and\noutline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To\ncontinuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also\nactively update a public repository at\nhttps://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.",

    "summary": "Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and\neven lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text\nin the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns.\nTherefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been\nproposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting\nsensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes\nuniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in\nsubstantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose\nSecret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private\nevolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE\nsatisfies $(\\mathrm{p}, \\mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a\nrelaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs,\nwhile also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline\nmethods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE\nconsistently achieves lower Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher\ndownstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less\nnoise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that\nsecret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective\nprivacy-preserving synthetic text generation.",

    "summary": "Selecting high-quality and diverse training samples from extensive datasets\nplays a crucial role in reducing training overhead and enhancing the\nperformance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing studies fall\nshort in assessing the overall value of selected data, focusing primarily on\nindividual quality, and struggle to strike an effective balance between\nensuring diversity and minimizing data point traversals. Therefore, this paper\nintroduces a novel choice-based sample selection framework that shifts the\nfocus from evaluating individual sample quality to comparing the contribution\nvalue of different samples when incorporated into the subset. Thanks to the\nadvanced language understanding capabilities of LLMs, we utilize LLMs to\nevaluate the value of each option during the selection process. Furthermore, we\ndesign a greedy sampling process where samples are incrementally added to the\nsubset, thereby improving efficiency by eliminating the need for exhaustive\ntraversal of the entire dataset with the limited budget. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that selected data from our method not only surpasses the\nperformance of the full dataset but also achieves competitive results with\nrecent powerful studies, while requiring fewer selections. Moreover, we\nvalidate our approach on a larger medical dataset, highlighting its practical\napplicability in real-world applications.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nas a key method to adapt pre-trained models to domain-specific tasks such as\nmathematical reasoning. However, standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens,\nneglecting that only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning\ncorrectness. This uniform supervision often causes reduced output diversity and\nlimited generalization. We propose Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a simple\nyet effective approach that updates only tokens identified as functionally\nindispensable via counterfactual perturbations. By focusing gradient signals on\nthese decisive reasoning steps while preserving the diversity of non-critical\ntokens, CFT can enhance both generation and diversity. Extensive experiments on\nfive models across three families (Qwen, OLMo, LLaMA) and eleven mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks show that CFT, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of\ntokens, consistently outperforms standard SFT. Moreover, CFT enables test-time\nscaling through improved sampling diversity and provides a stronger\ninitialization for reinforcement learning, sustaining performance gains in\nlater training stages while maintaining higher entropy for better exploration.\nThese results highlight CFT as a practical and general framework for efficient\nand robust LLM fine-tuning.",

Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity\naccelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech\ndatasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed\nfrom different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic\nstyles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate\nspeech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to\ndata-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to\naccount for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.\nRV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on\ndistinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework\nemploys reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the\ncontribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then\naggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two\nprimary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the\ndetection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides\ninterpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset.\nConsequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and\nachieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods.

This paper introduces\nRL-Focal, a two-stage RL agent framework that routes and ensembles LLMs. First,\nwe develop the Decider RL-agent, which learns to dynamically select an ensemble\nof small size ($m_i$) among $N$ LLMs ($m_i \\ll N$) for incoming queries from a\nuser-defined downstream task $i$, by maximizing both error-diversity and\nreasoning-performance of the selected ensemble through iterative updates of\ntask-adaptive rewards and policy. Second, to enable effective fusion of\ndynamically selected LLMs, we develop the stage-2 Fusion RL-agent, which learns\nto resolve reasoning conflicts from different LLMs and dynamically adapts to\ndifferent ensemble teams composed by the Decider Agent for different downstream\ntasks. Third, we introduce the focal diversity metric to better model the error\ncorrelations among multiple LLMs, further improving the generalization\nperformance of the Decider Agent, which actively prunes the ensemble\ncombinations. By focal diversity, we enhance performance across tasks by\neffectively promoting reward-aware and policy-adaptive ensemble selection and\ninference fusion. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that RL-Focal\nachieves the performance improvement of 8.48\\% with an ensemble of small size\ncompared to the best individual LLM in a pool and offers stronger robustness.\nCode is available at https://github.com/sftekin/rl-focal",

    "summary": "While large reasoning models demonstrate strong performance on complex tasks,\nthey lack the ability to adjust reasoning token usage based on task difficulty.\nThis often leads to the \"overthinking\" problem -- excessive and unnecessary\nreasoning -- which, although potentially mitigated by human intervention to\ncontrol the token budget, still fundamentally contradicts the goal of achieving\nfully autonomous AI. In this work, we propose Adaptive Reasoning Model (ARM), a\nreasoning model capable of adaptively selecting appropriate reasoning formats\nbased on the task at hand. These formats include three efficient ones -- Direct\nAnswer, Short CoT, and Code -- as well as a more elaborate format, Long CoT. To\ntrain ARM, we introduce Ada-GRPO, an adaptation of Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), which addresses the format collapse issue in traditional\nGRPO. Ada-GRPO enables ARM to achieve high token efficiency, reducing tokens by\nan average of 30%, and up to 70%, while maintaining performance comparable to\nthe model that relies solely on Long CoT. Furthermore, not only does it improve\ninference efficiency through reduced token generation, but it also brings a 2x\nspeedup in training. In addition to the default Adaptive Mode, ARM supports two\nadditional reasoning modes: 1) Instruction-Guided Mode, which allows users to\nexplicitly specify the reasoning format via special tokens -- ideal when the\nappropriate format is known for a batch of tasks. 2) Consensus-Guided Mode,\nwhich aggregates the outputs of the three efficient formats and resorts to Long\nCoT in case of disagreement, prioritizing performance with higher token usage.",

In this work, we\nrevisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been\nlargely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty\ndemand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may\nrequire the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its\ninitial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a\nframework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three\ncomponents: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target\nentropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment.

    "summary": "Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating\nwhich problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence\n(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how\nmodels play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new\nparadigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a\nformalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale\ndataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare\nevaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of\npeople and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative\nqueries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These\nqueries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI\nevaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to\nquantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to\npeople in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.\nHowever, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to\ngame-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more\n\"jaggedness\" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater\ndifficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning\nmodels show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing\nqueries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational\nmeta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.",

    "summary": "In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of\nnon-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize\ndiscontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which\nface challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide\nvariety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply\nexplore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid\ntagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our\nGapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps\nbetween entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance\ndiscontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an\nadditional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid\ntagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to\ncomprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span\nperspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine\nmechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of\neach span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes\ncriss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At\nthe inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each\nentity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all\nvalid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental\nresults on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable\nadvantages in recognizing complex entity structures.",

However, recent\nstudies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a\nmismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this\nissue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis\nstrategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create\ndata tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.\nSpecifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a\nquery-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher\nresponse quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned\nprompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate\nthen Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for\nthe entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset.

Recent studies have begun to explore using large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to\nstatic graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of\nreasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced\nLearning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that\nfine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.\nReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning\nstrategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly\njustify their predictions.

    "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for\napplications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical\nsettings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,\nand (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As\nclinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of\nits predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high\nconfidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting\nconfidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce\ncontext-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate\nresponses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive\naccuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically\nprioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy\nclinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically\nmotivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task\naccuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)\nperformance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice\nquestions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework\ntrained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot\ngeneralization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for\nscalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work\ndemonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering\nfor improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

While existing unlearning methods take into account the specific\ncharacteristics of LLMs, they often suffer from high computational demands,\nlimited applicability, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a lightweight behavioral unlearning framework based on\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. By modifying the external\nknowledge base of RAG, we simulate the effects of forgetting without directly\ninteracting with the unlearned LLM. We approach the construction of unlearned\nknowledge as a constrained optimization problem, deriving two key components\nthat underpin the effectiveness of RAG-based unlearning.

    "summary": "As increasingly capable large language models (LLMs) emerge, researchers have\nbegun exploring their potential for subjective tasks. While recent work\ndemonstrates that LLMs can be aligned with diverse human perspectives,\nevaluating this alignment on downstream tasks (e.g., hate speech detection)\nremains challenging due to the use of inconsistent datasets across studies. To\naddress this issue, in this resource paper we propose a two-step framework: we\n(1) introduce SubData, an open-source Python library designed for standardizing\nheterogeneous datasets to evaluate LLMs perspective alignment; and (2) present\na theory-driven approach leveraging this library to test how\ndifferently-aligned LLMs (e.g., aligned with different political viewpoints)\nclassify content targeting specific demographics. SubData's flexible mapping\nand taxonomy enable customization for diverse research needs, distinguishing it\nfrom existing resources. We illustrate its usage with an example application\nand invite contributions to extend our initial release into a multi-construct\nbenchmark suite for evaluating LLMs perspective alignment on natural language\nprocessing tasks.",

    "summary": "As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance\nbetween safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms,\nwhile essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline\nbenign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has\nsystematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting\nintroduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is\nharmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models\nfrequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or\ncompleting tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained\nalignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign\nparts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful\nelements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal\nbenchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18\nVLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under\nsemantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room\nfor improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models\naverage 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster\nthe development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain\nboth safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.",

    "summary": "Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving\nremains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to\nidentify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its\ncorresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current\nretrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using\nthe informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:\ninformal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on\nthe underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel\nframework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into\nsmaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval\nof premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT\nretrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in\nformalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,\nConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise\nretrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on\nProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the\nout-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and\n42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that\nretrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on\nmodel-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive\nretrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.",

While this ability is useful for interacting\nwith structured data like code files, another popular method,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment\nthe model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best\nrepresent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,\nparticularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a\nnovel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a\nGitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each\nhierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a\nknowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using\nRAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the\ngenerated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable\nacross both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the\nretriever, a significant gain in efficiency.

First, we conduct an English color-naming\nstudy, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native\nEnglish speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while\nLlama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.\nSecond, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or\nactually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate\ncultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated\nin-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively\nrestructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and\nincreased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages.

    "title": "Ev4DGS: Novel-view Rendering of Non-Rigid Objects from Monocular Event\n  Streams",
    "summary": "Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to\nsynchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques\nsupporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In\nthe case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally\nrequire sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it\nremains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.\nThis paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,\ni.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming\nobjects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)\nfrom monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian\nSplatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the\nestimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D\ndeformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform\nexperimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets\nwith non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its\nsuperior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied\nin our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the\nevaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:\nhttps://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/Ev4DGS/.",

    "summary": "Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former\nanalyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection\nenables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking\nby simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We\nplace a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the\nrest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker\nacross frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker\nremains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being\nunlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative\nprompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion\nmodels, we find that these \"emergent\" tracks outperform those of prior\nzero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance\nthat is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.",

    "summary": "In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid\ntraining on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For\nthe issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation\nquality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,\nreal-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior\nmethods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules\nfor inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both\nthe pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we\nincorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and\npanoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing\ndiversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied\nacross multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary\ncontinuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion\nawareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and\noutpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary\nconsistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics.

    "summary": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main\nworkhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of\ndata to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the\nability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these\nconcerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel\ninterplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,\nit utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while\nreducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters\nand properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our\nwork is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which\ncan effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of\nour novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image\nclassification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,\nBayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply\nevidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training\ndata is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows\nfor better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more\nreadily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been\ntrained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for\nmore efficient and robust image classification.",

    "title": "Diffusion Transformers with Representation Autoencoders",
    "summary": "Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a\nlatent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for\nDiffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely\nevolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which\nintroduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise\narchitectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict\ninformation capacity, and weak representations that result from purely\nreconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this\nwork, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders\n(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term\nRepresentation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality\nreconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a\nscalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are\ntypically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers\nto operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,\npropose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our\napproach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment\nlosses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we\nachieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no\nguidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance).

The central question we address\nin this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate\ntheoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce\nInfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce\nrichly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited\nscalability.

However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,\nocclusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene\nInteraction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent\nSMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within\na shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse\nmonocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,\nfuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and\nsynthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted\noptimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly\nenforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D\nreprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible\nregions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only\n9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.\nIt naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse\ninteractions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing\nmean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,\nand improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51.

To enable efficient inference, we design a\nstreaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory\nstructure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic\nretrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional\nKV-cache.

In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on\nenhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on\nedge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate\nperformance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a\npyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators\nthrough closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This\napproach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving\nexcellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that\ncapitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while\nincorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global\nimage enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency\ntransformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct\nweights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local\nLaplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency\ncomponents. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and\ntransformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on\nthe HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images\nprocessed in just 13 ms on a single GPU.

When imaging conditions of query\nimages, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training\nviews, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of\nprevious SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the\ntraining views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor\nessentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate\nthe coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer\nand a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the\ntransformer on tens of thousands of scenes.

    "summary": "Language-Guided object recognition in remote sensing imagery is crucial for\nlarge-scale mapping and automated data annotation. However, existing\nopen-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues,\nlimiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require\nadvanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks,\nincluding Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation\n(InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass\nscenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark\nfor earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing\ndatasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20\ncategories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions.\nGiven the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we\npropose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object\nrecognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret\nuser instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal,\nand formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem.\nBy integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM\nefficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence\nthresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses\nspecialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant\ninference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and\noverall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We\nbelieve the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective\napproach will advance future research in developing versatile object\nrecognition systems.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human\nemotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as\ntext, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network\narchitecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated\ndata. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal\ntasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random\nmixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the\nlack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose\nMS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that\nautomatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key\ncomponents of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)\nstrategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples\nwith contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module\nusing multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios\ndynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment\nAlignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across\nmodalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional\nregularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone\nnetwork jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six\nstate-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms\nexisting methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment\naugmentation.

    "summary": "Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a\ncritical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to\ninherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches\nleverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to\nhallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from\nSMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and\nreconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel\nframework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative\nmodel for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh\nreconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.\nMultiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles\nwith structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates\ncoarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary\nstrengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation\nframework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative\nmodel and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D\nsynchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D\nmultiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection\nmechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D\nshapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D\nhuman reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method\noutperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,\ndemonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.",

Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision\nsuffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging\nfrom user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content\n(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel\nuse cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for\nuniversal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system.

We build a\nmulti-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest\ntier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for\ninterpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the\ncomplementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and\nrobustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video\nsources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or\nsurpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while\nsubstantially improving generalization and interpretability.

This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target\ndomain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,\nobject appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.\nClosing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset\nand scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address\nthis, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model\nto a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it\ngenerates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any\nsynthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than\nmonths. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label\nmisalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak\nsynthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five\nsynthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up\nto +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly\nconstructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive\nsynthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design.

The recent emergence of\nVideo-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders\nwith powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that\ntransforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated\nreasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.\nThis survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training\nmethodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)\nfrom verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced\ninference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the\nroles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,\naddressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal\ngrounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through\nsystematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design\nprinciples, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open\nchallenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We\nfurther curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate\nrigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness.

    "summary": "Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet\ncurrent 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either\ndynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete\ncomprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an\nextensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks\nfollowing the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change\ndescriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the\naction task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages\n11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental\nmodels and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These\nobservations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as\ncategorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to\nsupport understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of\ncomparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we\npropose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point\ncloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens\nrequired for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange\ntasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene\nand situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and\ncross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using\nSituat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.",

However, the communication challenges associated with Semantic\nFacial Editing, one of the most important real-time CV applications on social\nmedia, still remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap by\nproposing Editable-DeepSC, a novel cross-modal semantic communication approach\nfor facial editing. Firstly, we theoretically discuss different transmission\nschemes that separately handle communications and editings, and emphasize the\nnecessity of Joint Editing-Channel Coding (JECC) via iterative attributes\nmatching, which integrates editings into the communication chain to preserve\nmore semantic mutual information. To compactly represent the high-dimensional\ndata, we leverage inversion methods via pre-trained StyleGAN priors for\nsemantic coding. To tackle the dynamic channel noise conditions, we propose\nSNR-aware channel coding via model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments indicate\nthat Editable-DeepSC can achieve superior editings while significantly saving\nthe transmission bandwidth, even under high-resolution and out-of-distribution\n(OOD) settings.",

    "summary": "Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through\nreinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the\nunderlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain\nunderexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior\nperformance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of\nmagnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment\nin specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and\nelaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability\nto convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned\ntext representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the\ngeneralization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this\nfundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs\ncontrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text\nrepresentations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on\nreasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality\nscoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to\nreasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters\nand inference time.",

These problems hinder fair comparisons\nbetween TTA methods and make it difficult to assess their practical strengths\nand weaknesses. To address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark\nimplements 8 episodic TTA and 7 online TTA methods within a unified and\nreproducible framework, and evaluates them across 15 widely used datasets.\nUnlike prior studies focused solely on CLIP, we extend the evaluation to\nSigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid loss--and include training-time tuning\nmethods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA to assess generality. Beyond\nclassification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates various evaluation metrics,\nincluding robustness, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and\nstability, enabling a more holistic assessment of TTA methods. Through\nextensive experiments, we find that 1) existing TTA methods produce limited\ngains compared to the previous pioneering work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit\npoor collaboration with training-time fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains\nfrequently come at the cost of reduced model trustworthiness.

This\nchallenge has recently been approached by pairwise matching of semantic\nfeatures from pre-trained vision models. However, despite their power, these\nfeatures struggle to differentiate instances of the same semantic class such as\n``left hand'' versus ``right hand'' which leads to substantial mapping errors.\nTo solve this, we learn a surface-aware embedding space that is robust to these\nambiguities while facilitating shared mapping for an entire family of 3D\nshapes. Importantly, our approach is self-supervised and requires only a small\nnumber of unpaired training meshes to infer features for new possibly imperfect\n3D shapes at test time. We achieve this by introducing a contrastive loss that\npreserves the semantic content of the features distilled from foundational\nmodels while disambiguating features located far apart on the shape's surface.\nWe observe superior performance in correspondence matching benchmarks and\nenable downstream applications including 2D-to-3D and 3D-to-3D texture\ntransfer, in-part segmentation, pose alignment, and motion transfer in low-data\nregimes.

To this end, we propose a\nnovel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert\nModality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective.\nIt consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to\ncompensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary\ninformation through multiple experts.

    "summary": "Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable\nsuccess in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world\ndownstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data\nand out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both\ncovariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and\nsemantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the\nimportance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD\ndata, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In\nthis paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set\ndata when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly\nreducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel\nOOD score, named {\\Delta}Energy. {\\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the\nvanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD\ndetection. Furthermore, {\\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD\ngeneralization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound\nmaximization for {\\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to\nnot only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,\nwhich serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this\nfinding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving\nVLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive\nexperiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by\n10% to 25% in AUROC.",

    "summary": "Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual\nQuestion Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with\nmassive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,\nreal-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human\nconfidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the\nmost frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open\nquestions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in\ntraining? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across\nvarying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples\ncontribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training\non the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU\ndistributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human\nuncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework.

    "summary": "Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical\nimaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their\npredefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing\ndifficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting\nto distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus\nnarrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a\nbottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited\ninvestigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we\nintroduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation\nadjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes\nin weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the\nlatent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift\nand that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features\nalong these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision\nboundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality\nof Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing\nvia simple class arithmetic.

Determining the scale bars is an important first step of\naccurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual\noperations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this\nissue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and\nextraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection\nand text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed\nframework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)\nmodel to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training\nand high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)\ninformation extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)\nsystem with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based\nalgorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The\nproposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and\naccurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean\nAverage Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95.

Previous arts failed to address both of them,\nalways with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem\nfrom the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that\nencode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text\nprompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a\nnull-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \\textbf{NTN-Diff}, for\ntext-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across\nmasked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,\nwhile preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.\nBased on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into\nearly (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the\nmid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As\nobserved, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be\nsemantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,\nserves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise\nlow-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided\ndenoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for\nmid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve\nthe unmasked regions.

    "summary": "The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early\nchildhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out\nappropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an\napproach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two\nwidely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we\nchoose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For\nexample, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes\ninclude `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel\nclassification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational\ncontent and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'\nvs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised\ncontrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated\nwith multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss\nfunction is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and\nthe samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and\nthe samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual\nand audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a\nmultimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and\naudio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,\nwe present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube\nlabeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers.

We begin by\ninvestigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs\nand find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's\nassociative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers\neffectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations\ncan be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.\nBuilding on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),\na lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior\nin MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate\nrepresentations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects\nhigh-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,\nwhose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with\noutput stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of\nassociative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors\nderived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to\nfollow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.\nNotably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on\nCreation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing\nexisting baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible\ncontrol over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.",

The SSL dataset includes three\nchallenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across\ndifferent scenarios.

Our findings highlight the benefits of\nleveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights\ninto the development of more effective sign language translation systems.

Building on the BLEnD dataset,\nBLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16\nregions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only\nbaseline querying from Region $\\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant\n(Entity $\\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated\nimages.

    "summary": "Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling\ntraining data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size\nconsistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,\nwhich are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer\ntypes and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for\npractical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development\nand deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L\nframework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which\nconsist of only $15\\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable\nperformance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach\napplies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale\nmodel to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer\n(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only\noutperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)\nacross several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale\nteacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled\nmodel exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to\nimage variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest\nthat the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and\nparameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for\ncancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.",

    "summary": "Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the\nsemantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for\nachieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched\npairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely\nsemantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during\nalignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These\nnon-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the\ndata, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is\nto separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.\nHowever, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which\ncannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style\ninformation. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing\nstyle interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the\nprobability of each feature column representing semantic information, and\nregard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the\nreliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative\nconstruction method. The key operation of this method is a performance\nfeedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the\nfunction can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance\nimprovements.

To solve this, we present\nCoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model\nthat bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and\ninterpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the\nreasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable\nheatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and\nyields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration\ntoken aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this\npositional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight\ndecoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.\nAcross the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best\nreported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with\nperformance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test\npartitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap\nstrongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent\nassociation between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.\nCollectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging\nreasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by\nreasoning and predicting masks more precisely.

    "summary": "Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their\nextracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and\nboundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable\ninformation for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically\nconcatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.\nHowever, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary\nviews, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing\nfusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and\nignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these\nissues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to\neffectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR\nmanifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.\nSpecifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive\nDefinite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann\nmanifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to\nlearn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview\nevidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates\nbelief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep\nfeatures. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines\nevidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification.

    "summary": "We present LiDAR-GS, a Gaussian Splatting (GS) method for real-time,\nhigh-fidelity re-simulation of LiDAR scans in public urban road scenes. Recent\nGS methods proposed for cameras have achieved significant advancements in\nreal-time rendering beyond Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, applying GS\nrepresentation to LiDAR, an active 3D sensor type, poses several challenges\nthat must be addressed to preserve high accuracy and unique characteristics.\nSpecifically, LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam splatting, using\nrange-view representation for precise surface splatting by projecting lasers\nonto micro cross-sections, effectively eliminating artifacts associated with\nlocal affine approximations. Furthermore, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian\nRepresentation, which further integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key\nLiDAR properties that are influenced by the incident direction and external\nfactors. Combining these practices with some essential adaptations, e.g.,\ndynamic instances decomposition, LiDAR-GS succeeds in simultaneously\nre-simulating depth, intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results in both rendering frame rate and quality on publically\navailable large scene datasets when compared with the methods using explicit\nmesh or implicit NeRF.

    "summary": "Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for\napplications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack\nof rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or\nimage translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or\nintroduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address\nthis, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a\nnovel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer\nfrom model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD\nmodels. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality\ngap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation\nfails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To\novercome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a\nbidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a\nconnection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich\nRGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by\nfeeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop\nsupervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are\nsemantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge\ntransfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on\npublic thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while\ndrastically reducing computational overhead.",

In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet\noften overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct\nnumber of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the\ndataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we\nconstruct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary\ndatasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6\nfeaturing complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the\nscaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to\nimprove counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key\nreason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization\nrather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that\nnoise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we\npropose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting\ncount-aware layout information into the noise prior.

While some methods leverage semantic knowledge\nfrom smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often\nintroduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which\neffectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal\nmodels to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans\nemploys CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak\nstudent, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy\ntask. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module\nfacilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality\nsemantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module\nenables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,\ntransforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into\ncategory-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual\nweight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct\noptimal multimodal FSL classifiers.

Current diagnostic workflows are complex and\nheavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early\ndetection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these\nissues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed\nPD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly\nfrom raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing\nModule (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability\nby flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It\nthen incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)\nBrain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions\nstrongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),\nwhich reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated\nregions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the\nRelevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides\nthe model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the\nAge-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps\nas auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic\naccuracy and clinical interpretability.

However, their\nmultimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can\nperturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or\npolicy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial\ntraining and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training\ntypically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high\ncomputational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer\nfrom degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex\nmultimodal tasks.\n  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently\nserves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation.

Unlike prior unsupervised purification\nmethods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions\nwhile significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.\nFurthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense\nmechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.\n  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering\ndemonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also\nexhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks.

This limitation restricts the model's ability to make\ninformed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios.

    "summary": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human\nassistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean\ndatasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,\nleading to inaccurate predictions. To address this, we introduce the first\nrobustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under\ndiverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with\nenvironmental variability, occlusions, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI,\nincludes 20 corruption types based on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a\nnew robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the\nHOI field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To\nimprove robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive\nLearning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic\nand partial cues, thus dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to\nenhance robust feature learning.

    "summary": "Structuring latent representations in a hierarchical manner enables models to\nlearn patterns at multiple levels of abstraction. However, most prevalent image\nunderstanding models focus on visual similarity, and learning visual\nhierarchies is relatively unexplored. In this work, for the first time, we\nintroduce a learning paradigm that can encode user-defined multi-level complex\nvisual hierarchies in hyperbolic space without requiring explicit hierarchical\nlabels. As a concrete example, first, we define a part-based image hierarchy\nusing object-level annotations within and across images. Then, we introduce an\napproach to enforce the hierarchy using contrastive loss with pairwise\nentailment metrics. Finally, we discuss new evaluation metrics to effectively\nmeasure hierarchical image retrieval. Encoding these complex relationships\nensures that the learned representations capture semantic and structural\ninformation that transcends mere visual similarity. Experiments in part-based\nimage retrieval show significant improvements in hierarchical retrieval tasks,\ndemonstrating the capability of our model in capturing visual hierarchies.",

    "summary": "Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to\nreduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often\nintroduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In\nparallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the\nordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant\ncontext during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided\nTransformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of\nthe current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and\ndependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns\npredefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using\ntransformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a\nteacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context\nassigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The\nteacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy\nmap to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the\nstudent to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial\ndependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded\ntokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves\nan 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional\nentropy model.",

Traditional Gradual Domain\nAdaptation methods mitigate domain bias by introducing intermediate domains and\nself-training strategies, but often face the challenges of inefficient\nknowledge migration or missing data in intermediate domains. In this paper, we\ndesign an optimisation framework based on the hyperparameter $\\lambda$ by\ndynamically balancing the loss weights of the source and target domains, which\nenables the model to progressively adjust the strength of knowledge migration\n($\\lambda$ incrementing from 0 to 1) during the training process, thus\nachieving cross-domain generalisation more efficiently. Specifically, the\nmethod incorporates self-training to generate pseudo-labels and iteratively\nupdates the model by minimising a weighted loss function to ensure stability\nand robustness during progressive adaptation in the intermediate domain. The\nexperimental part validates the effectiveness of the method on rotated MNIST,\ncolour-shifted MNIST, portrait dataset and forest cover type dataset, and the\nresults show that it outperforms existing baseline methods.

To this end, we introduce \\textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary\nperspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency\n(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same\nknowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate\nwhether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that\nrequires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate\nfaithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models\ncan handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,\nwe carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for\neach task.

    "summary": "Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but\nremain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than\nediting diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models\nstruggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions\nof auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational\nstrengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial\nstructure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances\ndiagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward\nthat evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an\noriginal diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this\nreward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line\nreasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL\nstage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop\na scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of\n3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual\nfields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often\nsuperior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on\nauxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective\nrequires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning\nresilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient\ntraining on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy\nand fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a\nframework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its\n\\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm\n(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \\textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)\nare less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.\nLeveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm\nthat retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show\nthat models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher\nadversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under\nboth standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset\nproperty, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method\nfor improving adversarial robustness.

    "summary": "Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both\nglobal dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local\nmotion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for\nvideo-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods\ntypically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling\nstructure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have\ndifficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the\nnetwork to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing\nVHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global\ndependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution\nsequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated\nsignificant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;\nhowever, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a\nnovel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global\nand local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.\nSpecifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D\nselective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to\nefficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We\nfurther introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to\nenhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive\nexperiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model\noutperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better\ncomputational trade-offs.",

    "summary": "Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision\nlanguage models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding\nhow multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.\nMultiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance\nby creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought\nreasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional\nreasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are\nfar superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the\nlimited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either\nresource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In\nthis paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs\nwith carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to\nimprove VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning\nprocess boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM\npredictions.

We introduce\nNovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes\nfront-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a\nsingle branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns\nwaypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image\nand depth patches.

On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the\nMD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts\npath-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from\n2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art.

While prior studies\nhave predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and\nachieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental\nbottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored.

This modular decomposition facilitates a\nsystematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our\nfindings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual\ndeficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current\nmodels.

    "summary": "Fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for infrared small target\ndetection poses significant challenges due to severe domain shifts. Existing\nadaptation methods often incorporate handcrafted priors to bridge this gap, yet\nsuch designs limit generalization and scalability. We identify a fundamental\ntexture bias in foundation models, which overly depend on local texture cues\nfor target localization. To address this, we propose Ladder Shape-Biased\nSide-Tuning (LSP-ST), a novel approach that introduces a shape-aware inductive\nbias to facilitate effective adaptation beyond texture cues. In contrast to\nprior work that injects explicit edge or contour features, LSP-ST models shape\nas a global structural prior, integrating both boundaries and internal layouts.\nWe design a Shape-Enhanced Large-Kernel Attention Module to hierarchically and\nimplicitly capture structural information in a fully differentiable manner,\nwithout task-specific handcrafted guidance. A theoretical analysis grounded in\nmatched filtering and backpropagation reveals the mechanism by which the\nproposed attention improves structure-aware learning. With only 4.72M learnable\nparameters, LSP-ST achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple infrared\nsmall target detection benchmarks. Furthermore, its strong generalization is\nvalidated across tasks such as mirror detection, shadow detection, and\ncamouflaged object detection, while maintaining stable performance on\ntexture-driven tasks like salient object detection, demonstrating that the\nintroduced shape bias complements rather than competes with texture-based\nreasoning.",

    "summary": "Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action\nrecognition and emotion classification by combining information from different\nmodalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong\nmodalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of\nweaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),\nwhich applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to\nmitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM\neffectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and\ndoes not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we\nfurther introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts\nthe mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to\nthe learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal\nrobustness.",

    "summary": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning\nmeaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical\nframework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL\nparadigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel\ninformation-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We\ndefine representation efficiency $\\eta$ as the ratio between the effective\nintrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient\ndimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral\nproperties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold\ninduced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical\nanalysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we\nprove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\\eta = 1$)\nby driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity\nmatrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous\ntheoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and\noffers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.",

While Variational\nAutoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their\nGaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency\ninformation, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose\nLatent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration\nby jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware\nreconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic\nrobustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation\nperturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency\nreconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration\nmodel using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA\nguided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover\nauthentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to\nsynthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating\noptimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained\nlatent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\\alpha} enables flexible\nfidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,\neffectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction\naccuracy.",

To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking\nmethod named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a\ndual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and\nlocalization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative\nquality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a\ndense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion\nsensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and\nthe tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results.

While these priors improve reconstruction quality\nwith fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie\noutside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods\nin this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may\nnot be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or\n(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather\nthan distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free\nuncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no\nknowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key\nhypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable\nunder random measurement variations, while reconstructions of\nout-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this\nstability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD\nindicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse\nproblem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where\na learned proximal network trained only on digit \"0\" is evaluated on all ten\ndigits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and\ncorrespondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These\nresults suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with\nlightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for\nin-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out\nof distribution.",

We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark\nstate-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference\nvideo pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research\nin AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated,\nrubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across\nmodels. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level\ncoaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating\nnuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems.

    "summary": "Most video compression methods focus on human visual perception, neglecting\nsemantic preservation. This leads to severe semantic loss during the\ncompression, hampering downstream video analysis tasks. In this paper, we\npropose a Masked Video Modeling (MVM)-powered compression framework that\nparticularly preserves video semantics, by jointly mining and compressing the\nsemantics in a self-supervised manner. While MVM is proficient at learning\ngeneralizable semantics through the masked patch prediction task, it may also\nencode non-semantic information like trivial textural details, wasting bitcost\nand bringing semantic noises. To suppress this, we explicitly regularize the\nnon-semantic entropy of the compressed video in the MVM token space. The\nproposed framework is instantiated as a simple Semantic-Mining-then-Compression\n(SMC) model. Furthermore, we extend SMC as an advanced SMC++ model from several\naspects. First, we equip it with a masked motion prediction objective, leading\nto better temporal semantic learning ability. Second, we introduce a\nTransformer-based compression module, to improve the semantic compression\nefficacy. Considering that directly mining the complex redundancy among\nheterogeneous features in different coding stages is non-trivial, we introduce\na compact blueprint semantic representation to align these features into a\nsimilar form, fully unleashing the power of the Transformer-based compression\nmodule. Extensive results demonstrate the proposed SMC and SMC++ models show\nremarkable superiority over previous traditional, learnable, and perceptual\nquality-oriented video codecs, on three video analysis tasks and seven\ndatasets. \\textit{Codes and model are available at:\nhttps://github.com/tianyuan168326/VideoSemanticCompression-Pytorch.",

    "summary": "With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made\nremarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene\ntext remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing\nmethods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to\ncontent replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style\ntransfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free\ndiffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text\nin scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style\ntransfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables\nprompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while\npreserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we\ndesign a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and\nself-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region\ncontrol mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at\neach denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance\nvisual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier\ntransform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method achieves superior performance in scene text style\ntransformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual\nfidelity and text preservation.",

    "summary": "In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR)\nalgorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite\nits reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard\nsamples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular\nor cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition\nhardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an\noverly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss\nfunction is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).\nFirstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution\nis stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density\nFunction (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability\ndistribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification\nmethod using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is\nimplemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to\napply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their\nrepresentation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that\noptimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is\nsuperior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving\n49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method\nby 2.37%.",

Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate\nreasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted\nthinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution.

In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and\nrace-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We\nextend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and\nevaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing\nthe final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves\nthe fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall\npredictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method\nto different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve\nsimilarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its\nmodel-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training\nmethod with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,\nincluding adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active\nlearning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias\nreduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that\ncombining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the\nlargest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of\ndistribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and\neffective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.",

    "summary": "Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering\nreliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate\nresearch. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with\nMulti-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud\nsegmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2\n(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:\nclear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a\nSwin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale\ncontext modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A\nCross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature\nfusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)\nand a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.\nComprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM\ndelivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline\narchitectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.\nThese results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it\nwell-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world\napplications.",

Previous methods directly divided the latent\nspace into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the\nglobal shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we\nretain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate\nregion-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,\nwe curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a\nstep-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we\ndemonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse\nidentities and expressions outperforming previous approaches.

    "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across\nvarious tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily\nlarge model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory\nfootprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but\nnot all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep\narchitectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted\ncomputation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which\nin turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.\nTo address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which\nprovide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we\npropose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which\nbegins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally\nincreases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process\nuntil the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the\ngiven datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and\ninference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational\nefficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show\nthat the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve\nup to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a\ncompetitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.",

This limitation\nmotivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision\nprocesses are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face\nsimilarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from\nrestricted receptive fields.

    "summary": "In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge\nachieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled\nlearning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and\nindividual regrets can be bounded by $O(\\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of\nactions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality\nof the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this\nend, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the\nstrongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,\nboth the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\\sqrt{\\log m\n\\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an\noptimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of\ncertain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We\nthen show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and\nindividual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge\nby providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,\nthese social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant\nfactor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the\nlast-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic\nbased on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent\ndynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.",

The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an\nODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \\emph{which processes\nproduce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration\nvanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide\na concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional\nacceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.\nUsing this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show\nthat straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We\nalso derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general\nprocesses, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to\nintegrate.",

    "summary": "We study the sublinear space continual release model for edge-differentially\nprivate (DP) graph algorithms, with a focus on the densest subgraph problem\n(DSG) in the insertion-only setting. Our main result is the first continual\nrelease DSG algorithm that matches the additive error of the best static DP\nalgorithms and the space complexity of the best non-private streaming\nalgorithms, up to constants. The key idea is a refined use of subsampling that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy amplification and sparsification, a connection\nnot previously formalized in graph DP. Via a simple black-box reduction to the\nstatic setting, we obtain both pure and approximate-DP algorithms with $O(\\log\nn)$ additive error and $O(n\\log n)$ space, improving both accuracy and space\ncomplexity over the previous state of the art. Along the way, we introduce\ngraph densification in the graph DP setting, adding edges to trigger earlier\nsubsampling, which removes the extra logarithmic factors in error and space\nincurred by prior work [ELMZ25].

To date, existing DFL methods\ntypically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient\nto capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address\nthis challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains\na diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and\noptimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn\nfrom the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate\ndiffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training\nthrough diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to\nthe need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we\npropose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward\ndiffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows\nfrom our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be\napproximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that\nour diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in\ndecision quality.

We\ndemonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to\nout-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We\nalso demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as\nwell as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL\napproaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been\nenabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously\ntrained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning\nalgorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and\nwe theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement\nlearning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning\nfrom mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences\nencoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the\nparity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement\nlearning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to\ngeneralize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or\ncomputational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning\nleverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to\nfacilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically\nprove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can\nefficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion\nof long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input\ndimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,\nincluding the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of\ncommon mathematical reasoning benchmarks.",

To mitigate this hallucination\neffect, selectively abstaining from answering, called selective generation,\nprovides an effective way for generators to control the hallucination when\nuncertain about their answers. However, as selective generators interact under\nadversarial environments and receive partial feedback from users on selected\ngeneration (e.g., thumbs up or down on the selected answer), learning methods\nfor selective generation under such practical setups are crucial but currently\nmissing. To address this limitation, we propose an online learning algorithm\nfor selective generation with partial feedback under an adaptive adversary. In\nparticular, we re-purpose an adversarial bandit algorithm to design an online\nselective generation method with controllable false discovery rates (FDR),\nwhich measures the rate of hallucination. The key building blocks include a\nnovel conversion lemma from regret of any bandit algorithm to the FDR, and the\nexploitation of a unique structure of selective generation to reuse partial\nfeedback, which we call feedback unlocking. We empirically evaluate the\nefficacy of the proposed online selective generation algorithm with partial\nfeedback over diverse learning environments, demonstrating its ability to\ncontrol the FDR, while maintaining reasonable selection efficiency, i.e., the\nratio of non-abstaining answers, compared to baselines.",

    "summary": "Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information\nretrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is\nnon-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include\nLearning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics\nlike NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable\nsorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for\ndirect Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix\naggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable\napproximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft\npermutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K\noperator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \\log n)$ complexity due to their\ndependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a\nnovel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.\nBy relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and\navoids sorting.

    "summary": "Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence\nof undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its\nutility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing\nprivacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning\neffects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight\nquantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.\nPrior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives\nby explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take\na different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent\nof unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We\nshow that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it\nexploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order\n(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the\nresilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,\nsuch as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,\ngradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While\nthese optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage\nconvergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby\nresisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with\nrandomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust\nunlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that\ncombines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy\nwhile enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP\nbenchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our\napproach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning\nquality.",

However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus\non semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models\noften generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no\ncorresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination\nand identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the\nprevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current\nmetrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation\nframework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event\ndetectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and\nseverity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and\nIH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose\nPosterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that\nmitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial\naudio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio\nafter masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments\non several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models\nsuffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence\nand duration of hallucinations by over 50\\% on average, without degrading, and\nin some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and\ntemporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define,\nsystematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination,\npaving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.",

While Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they\ninherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based\ntraffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as\nrepresenting the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can\nbe inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,\nwe propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal\nforecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a\nVision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as\nimage sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform\ncell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling\nnumerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents\nfloating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled\nwith a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first\ntrained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for\npredictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a\nmemory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world\nmobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing\nmethods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best\nbaseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios.

    "summary": "Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages\ndistributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the\nchallenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained\nmodels by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,\nin heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the\nglobal model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of\nindividual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning\ntechniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address\nthis, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA\nmatrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and\nmagnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning\nmethod. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,\nwhich encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more\neffectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,\nby fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which\nencode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized\nknowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a\npipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further\nimproves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and\nlocal levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model\nand the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data\nscenarios.

    "summary": "In the era of mega-constellations, the need for accurate and publicly\navailable information has become fundamental for satellite operators to\nguarantee the safety of spacecrafts and the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space\nenvironment. This study critically evaluates the accuracy and reliability of\npublicly available ephemeris data for a LEO mega-constellation - Starlink. The\ngoal of this work is twofold: (i) compare and analyze the quality of the data\nagainst high-precision numerical propagation. (ii) Leverage Physics-Informed\nMachine Learning to extract relevant satellite quantities, such as\nnon-conservative forces, during the decay process. By analyzing two months of\nreal orbital data for approximately 1500 Starlink satellites, we identify\ndiscrepancies between high precision numerical algorithms and the published\nephemerides, recognizing the use of simplified dynamics at fixed thresholds,\nplanned maneuvers, and limitations in uncertainty propagations. Furthermore, we\ncompare data obtained from multiple sources to track and analyze deorbiting\nsatellites over the same period. Empirically, we extract the acceleration\nprofile of satellites during deorbiting and provide insights relating to the\neffects of non-conservative forces during reentry. For non-deorbiting\nsatellites, the position Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was approximately 300 m,\nwhile for deorbiting satellites it increased to about 600 m. Through this\nin-depth analysis, we highlight potential limitations in publicly available\ndata for accurate and robust Space Situational Awareness (SSA), and\nimportantly, we propose a data-driven model of satellite decay in\nmega-constellations.",

    "summary": "Classical federated learning (FL) assumes that the clients have a limited\namount of noisy data with which they voluntarily participate and contribute\ntowards learning a global, more accurate model in a principled manner. The\nlearning happens in a distributed fashion without sharing the data with the\ncenter. However, these methods do not consider the incentive of an agent for\nparticipating and contributing to the process, given that data collection and\nrunning a distributed algorithm is costly for the clients. The question of\nrationality of contribution has been asked recently in the literature and some\nresults exist that consider this problem. This paper addresses the question of\nsimultaneous parameter learning and incentivizing contribution in a truthful\nmanner, which distinguishes it from the extant literature. Our first mechanism\nincentivizes each client to contribute to the FL process at a Nash equilibrium\nand simultaneously learn the model parameters. We also ensure that agents are\nincentivized to truthfully reveal information in the intermediate stages of the\nalgorithm. However, this equilibrium outcome can be away from the optimal,\nwhere clients contribute with their full data and the algorithm learns the\noptimal parameters. We propose a second mechanism that enables the full data\ncontribution along with optimal parameter learning. Large scale experiments\nwith real (federated) datasets (CIFAR-10, FEMNIST, and Twitter) show that these\nalgorithms converge quite fast in practice, yield good welfare guarantees and\nbetter model performance for all agents.",

    "summary": "The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming\nincreasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,\nas our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good\ncompression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,\ntrial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression\nframework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model\nweights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose\nunique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,\nand the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions\nrather than na\\\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight\nCompression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model\nweight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of\nautoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)\ncolumn-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training\nloss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model\noutputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves\ncompetitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with\nparticularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly\non par with FP16 models.",

    "summary": "Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks.\nWhile PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language\nmodels (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to\nboth correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical\napplications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled\ndata for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose\nDisagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to\noptimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\\tau$) in post-hoc confidence\ncalibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by\nprediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their\nconfidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence\nunderestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a\nlarger $\\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by\nselectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively\ndecoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an\noverly large $\\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples,\nimproving calibration performance.

A key challenge is integrating these\nmodalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D\ncoordinates.

In this work, we propose \\textbf{U}nified\nVariational \\textbf{A}uto-\\textbf{E}ncoder for \\textbf{3D} Molecular Latent\nDiffusion Modeling (\\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D\nmolecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining\nnear-zero reconstruction error.

    "summary": "Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network\ntraining, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar\ngradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a\ndiversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an\napproximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously\noverlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally\nnon-gradient \"curl\"-like components while still being able to effectively\noptimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with\ninhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,\nresulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any\nobjective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze\nfeedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher\nframework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons\nexhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of\nthe original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to\ngradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the\nsolution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of\nstability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In\nother cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to\ngradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by\ntemporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures\ncapable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an\nimportant counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in\nneural networks.",

Despite their\nnow established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to\nflagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than\nprecisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection\ngranularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,\nensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,\nevaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent\nwork made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus\nnarrowing down the vulnerability detection \"window\" and providing more\nfine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the\npresence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often\npredominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms.

Our approach, defined as Detection\nAlignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines\nthat most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the\nvulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and\nadaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze\nmultiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets.

    "summary": "High-intensity laser plasma interactions create complex computational\nproblems because they involve both fluid and kinetic regimes, which need models\nthat maintain physical precision while keeping computational speed. The\nresearch introduces a machine learning-based three-dimensional hybrid\nfluid-particle-in-cell (PIC) system, which links relativistic plasma behavior\nto automatic regime transitions. The technique employs fluid approximations for\nstable areas but activates the PIC solver when SwitchNet directs it to unstable\nsections through its training on physics-based synthetic data. The model uses a\nsmooth transition between Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) tunneling and\nmultiphoton ionization rates to simulate ionization, while Airy-function\napproximations simulate quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects for radiation\nreaction and pair production. The convolutional neural network applies energy\nconservation through physics-based loss functions, which operate on normalized\nfields per channel. Monte Carlo dropout provides uncertainty measurement. The\nhybrid model produces precise predictions with coefficient of determination\n(R^2) values above 0.95 and mean squared errors below 10^-4 for all field\ncomponents. This adaptive approach enhances the accuracy and scalability of\nlaser-plasma simulations, providing a unified predictive framework for\nhigh-energy-density and particle acceleration applications.",

    "summary": "Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that\nemerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine\nintelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role\nof the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains\nlargely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and\nsupervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward\nfundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical\ndecision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal\nthat RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining\nstable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic\nattractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,\nwhich converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We\nfurther show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a\npowerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that\nenhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous\nsolutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex\ndynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and\ncorrelates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity\nincreases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary\ndeterminant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization\nautonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less\naccessible to direct gradient-based optimization.

    "summary": "Recent advance in sparse attention mechanisms has demonstrated strong\npotential for reducing the computational cost of long-context training and\ninference in large language models (LLMs). Native Sparse Attention (NSA), one\nstate-of-the-art approach, introduces natively trainable, hardware-aligned\nsparse attention that delivers substantial system-level performance boost while\nmaintaining accuracy comparable to full attention. However, the kernel\nimplementation of NSA forces a loop order that is only efficient with a\nrelatively large number of query heads in each Grouped Query Attention (GQA)\ngroup, whereas existing LLMs widely adopt much smaller number of query heads in\neach GQA group -- such an inconsistency significantly limits the applicability\nof this sparse algorithmic advance.

To address these requirements, we\nintroduce AB-UPT as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for\nCFD simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and\nprediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to\nhigh-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent\nspace, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity\noutputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a divergence-free formulation.

Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables\nthe enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without\ndegradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity\nfields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less\nthan a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within\nseconds.

We develop a 24-48 h\nearly-warning model for summer, thunderstorm-related outages in Michigan using\nonly open sources (EAGLE-I for ground truth; METAR for weather). We use the\npublicly released EAGLE-I outage dataset (2014-2022), maintained by Oak Ridge\nNational Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. The pipeline preserves\nconvective micro-signals from a sparse station network via parameter-specific\nkriging with hourly variograms and targeted overdrafting to retain extremes,\nand builds causal spatio-temporal features (lags/rolling statistics; k-NN/IDW\nspatial aggregates) capturing precursors of severe convection (moisture\nadvection, wind shifts, and pressure drops). The two-stage model design,\ncombining a logistic gate and an LSTM regressor, limits routine periods and\nreduces noise exposure. The study uses event-centric metrics (cluster-based\nhits/misses/false alarms) and peak-conditional MASE (cMASE) in +/-Delta-hour\nwindows around state-level peaks (>= 50,000), with uncertainty quantified by\nhourly moving-block bootstrap.\n  On the test sample, Two-Stage detects more reference peaks across all windows\n(e.g., at +/-48 h it records 3/4 vs. 2/4; F1 66.7% vs. 57.1%) with one extra\nfalse alarm. Near peaks, it shows modest amplitude gains (2-3% lower cMASE at\n+/-0-12 h; bootstrap medians +9-13% at +/-6-12 h) but small losses at +/-36-48\nh (~3-4%). Overall, errors are comparable to the one-step LSTM baseline. SHAP\nanalysis confirms moisture-advection and wind/gust precursors, underscoring the\nvalue of the feature engineering.

To\naddress these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of\nfreedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the\nunbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time\nrequired to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition\nregions, while preserving the correct PMF.

    "summary": "Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a\nmodel at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and\nhave found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is\nlimited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations\nmostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to\nout-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the\ngrowing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution\nquestions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain\nglobally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization\nafter generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.\nSpecifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in\nwhich TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than\nglobal training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by\ntraining a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related\ndata points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform\nscaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical\nimplications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most\neffective.",

    "summary": "Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution\nshifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary\ncause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on\nfeatures that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We\nintroduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that\nidentifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test\ndistributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features\nwhile varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations\nusing Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance\ndirections associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by\nremoving their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed\nrepresentations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously\ntracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal\nfeatures. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and\nempirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Traditional\nshortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally\nprohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous\nuser demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based\napproaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological\ngeneralization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper\npresents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that\njointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video\nquality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained\nminimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is\ndeveloped to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths\nand adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed\nas the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing\ndecisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely\napproximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly\nreducing computational complexity.

In this\nwork, we propose a novel adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation\ntheorem for generative modeling and introduce the Thermodynamic\nKolmogorov-Arnold Model (T-KAM) to take advantage of structural and inductive\nbiases.

This paper presents\na deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving\nphysiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based\ndenoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance\ndenoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant\nsignal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an\nauxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through\nHR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method\nachieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion\nartifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our\nmethod can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,\nhighlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.\nThese results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical\ndeployment in wearable healthcare systems.",

However, the open wireless\nenvironment, dynamic topology, and resource constraints of UAVs expose\nlow-altitude networks to severe DoS threats. Traditional defense approaches,\nwhich rely on fixed configurations or centralized decision-making, cannot\neffectively respond to the rapidly changing conditions in UAV swarm\nenvironments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated\nmulti-agent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense\n(MTD) framework for proactive DoS mitigation in low-altitude networks.\nSpecifically, we design lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including\nleader switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, to disrupt attacker\nefforts and enhance network resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a\nmulti-agent partially observable Markov decision process, capturing the\nuncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV is equipped with a policy\nagent that autonomously selects MTD actions based on partial observations and\nlocal experiences. By employing a policy gradient-based algorithm, UAVs\ncollaboratively optimize their policies via reward-weighted aggregation.\nExtensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack\nmitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and\ndecreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,\nrespectively, under various DoS attack strategies.

Despite the progress in the past\ndecades, existing practice in causal discovery (CD) heavily relies on\nhigh-quality measured variables, which are usually given by human experts. In\nfact, the lack of well-defined high-level variables behind unstructured data\nhas been a longstanding roadblock to a broader real-world application of CD.\nThis procedure can naturally benefit from an automated process that can suggest\npotential hidden variables in the system. Interestingly, Large language models\n(LLMs) are trained on massive observations of the world and have demonstrated\ngreat capability in processing unstructured data. To leverage the power of\nLLMs, we develop a new framework termed Causal representatiOn AssistanT (COAT)\nthat incorporates the rich world knowledge of LLMs to propose useful measured\nvariables for CD with respect to high-value target variables on their paired\nunstructured data. Instead of directly inferring causality with LLMs, COAT\nconstructs feedback from intermediate CD results to LLMs to refine the proposed\nvariables. Given the target variable and the paired unstructured data, we first\ndevelop COAT-MB that leverages the predictivity of the proposed variables to\niteratively uncover the Markov Blanket of the target variable. Built upon\nCOAT-MB, COAT-PAG further extends to uncover a more complete causal graph,\ni.e., Partial Ancestral Graph, by iterating over the target variables and\nactively seeking new high-level variables. Moreover, the reliable CD\ncapabilities of COAT also extend the debiased causal inference to unstructured\ndata by discovering an adjustment set. We establish theoretical guarantees for\nthe CD results and verify their efficiency and reliability across realistic\nbenchmarks and real-world case studies.",

    "title": "Joint Source-Environment Adaptation of Data-Driven Underwater Acoustic\n  Source Ranging Based on Model Uncertainty",
    "summary": "Adapting pre-trained deep learning models to new and unknown environments\nremains a major challenge in underwater acoustic localization. We show that\nalthough the performance of pre-trained models suffers from mismatch between\nthe training and test data, they generally exhibit a higher uncertainty in\nenvironments where there is more mismatch. Additionally, in the presence of\nenvironmental mismatch, spurious peaks can appear in the output of\nclassification-based localization approaches, which inspires us to define and\nuse a method to quantify the \"implied uncertainty\" based on the number of model\noutput peaks. Leveraging this notion of implied uncertainty, we partition the\ntest samples into sets with more certain and less certain samples, and\nimplement a method to adapt the model to new environments by using the certain\nsamples to improve the labeling for uncertain samples, which helps to adapt the\nmodel. Thus, using this efficient method for model uncertainty quantification,\nwe showcase an innovative approach to adapt a pre-trained model to unseen\nunderwater environments at test time. This eliminates the need for labeled data\nfrom the target environment or the original training data. This adaptation is\nenhanced by integrating an independent estimate based on the received signal\nenergy. We validate the approach extensively using real experimental data, as\nwell as synthetic data consisting of model-generated signals with real ocean\nnoise. The results demonstrate significant improvements in model prediction\naccuracy, underscoring the potential of the method to enhance underwater\nacoustic localization in diverse, noisy, and unknown environments.",

To\nthis end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog\ngeneration LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that\nperforms robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we\npropose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog\nsnippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency\nvia the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a\nhigh-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage \"distill-then-RL\" training\npipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by\nadaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by\nadaptively adjusting sampling rate.

We introduce a principled risk decomposition\nthat separates the total ICL risk into two orthogonal components: Bayes Gap and\nPosterior Variance. The Bayes Gap quantifies how well the trained model\napproximates the Bayes-optimal in-context predictor. For a uniform-attention\nTransformer, we derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on this gap, which\nexplicitly clarifies the dependence on the number of pretraining prompts and\ntheir context length. The Posterior Variance is a model-independent risk\nrepresenting the intrinsic task uncertainty. Our key finding is that this term\nis determined solely by the difficulty of the true underlying task, while the\nuncertainty arising from the task mixture vanishes exponentially fast with only\na few in-context examples. Together, these results provide a unified view of\nICL: the Transformer selects the optimal meta-algorithm during pretraining and\nrapidly converges to the optimal algorithm for the true task at test time.",

Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized\nto regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning.

However, BT-based RMs often\nstruggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,\nleading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.\nConsequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well\nto Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To\naddress these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to\nBT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to\ndynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,\nbased on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which\nis approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport\n(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,\nour adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences\nbetween chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in\nperformance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities.

    "title": "Redundancy as a Structural Information Principle for Learning and\n  Generalization",
    "summary": "We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory\nto finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental\nproperty of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this\nframework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational\ndivergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual\ninformation, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single\ngeometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not\nisolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory\nfurther predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise\nto an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)\nand over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors\nminimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,\nsuch as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and\ngeneralization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are\nused to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable\nredundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish\nredundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic\nworld of communication and the finite world of learning.",

    "summary": "Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a fundamental graph similarity metric widely\nused in various applications. However, computing GED is an NP-hard problem.\nRecent state-of-the-art hybrid GED solver has shown promising performance by\nformulating GED as a bipartite graph matching problem, then leveraging a\ngenerative diffusion model to predict node matching between two graphs, from\nwhich both the GED and its corresponding edit path can be extracted using a\ntraditional algorithm. However, such methods typically rely heavily on\nground-truth supervision, where the ground-truth node matchings are often\ncostly to obtain in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose GEDRanker,\na novel unsupervised GAN-based framework for GED computation. Specifically,\nGEDRanker consists of a matching-based GED solver and introduces an\ninterpretable preference-aware discriminator. By leveraging preference signals\nover different node matchings derived from edit path lengths, the discriminator\ncan guide the matching-based solver toward generating high-quality node\nmatching without the need for ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments\non benchmark datasets demonstrate that our GEDRanker enables the matching-based\nGED solver to achieve near-optimal solution quality without any ground-truth\nsupervision.",

However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on\neither directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent\ninteracts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim\nagent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising\nresults, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two\nmajor reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and\ndependent on interactions with victim agents.\n  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we\nredesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead\nwell-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these\nagents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a\nneutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open\nsystems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim\nagents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment.

Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this\nissue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control\nunresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance\nunclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which\neliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy\ngradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through\ntemperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as\nregularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as\nregularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting\noptimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)\nstabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in\nGRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves\nthen declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,\nexploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a\nbroader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE\nregularizers.",

Recently, Large Language\nModels have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their\npotential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make\ntwo contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including\nGPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional\nsequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and\n(2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to\naddress the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain.

Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric\nchanges, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for\nlong-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via\nInterpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block\nthat embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation.

    "title": "A Comprehensive Evaluation on Quantization Techniques for Large Language\n  Models",
    "summary": "For large language models (LLMs), post-training quantization (PTQ) can\nsignificantly reduce memory footprint and computational overhead. Model\nquantization is rapidly evolving. Though many papers report breakthrough\nresults, they are often evaluated under different settings because a method\ntypically contains multiple components. Analyzing connections among existing\nmethods is important for deeper understanding. To bridge these gaps, we conduct\nan extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive\nevaluations under the same conditions for fair comparison. To our knowledge,\nsuch a fair and extensive investigation remains critically underexplored. To\nbetter understand connections, first, we decouple published quantization\nmethods into two steps: pre-quantization transformation and quantization error\nmitigation. The former is a preprocessing step that reduces outlier impact by\nflattening the data distribution; the latter offsets quantization errors to\nimprove performance. Second, we evaluate and analyze the impact of different\nsettings, including granularity and symmetry. Third, we analyze and evaluate\nthe latest MXFP4 and NVFP4 data formats and their performance. Our experiments\nfirst demonstrate that optimized rotation and scaling yield the best\npre-quantization performance, and that combining low-rank compensation with\nGPTQ can occasionally outperform GPTQ alone for error mitigation. Second, finer\ngranularity improves performance but increases storage overhead. Third, we find\nthat scaling-factor format and precision greatly affect FP4 performance, and\nthat rotation-based strategies effective for INT4 offer limited gains for MXFP4\nand NVFP4, motivating further study.",

    "title": "Quantifying Dataset Similarity to Guide Transfer Learning",
    "summary": "Transfer learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, as it\ncan empower models by leveraging knowledge from related domains to improve\nlearning effectiveness. However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm\nrather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the\ntransfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address\nthis challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity\nand provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature,\nexisting methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label\ninformation and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical\ntransferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning\nScore (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization\nperformance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by\nestablishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision\nboundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is\nefficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive\ndistribution estimation for high-dimensional problems. We further introduce a\ngeneral framework that categorizes source datasets into positive, ambiguous, or\nnegative transfer zones based on their CLS relative to the baseline error,\nenabling informed decisions. Additionally, we extend this approach to\nencoder-head architectures in deep learning to better reflect modern transfer\npipelines. Extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that CLS can reliably predict whether transfer will improve or\ndegrade performance, offering a principled tool for guiding data selection in\ntransfer learning.",

Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel\nround-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing\ntime into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)\nadapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and\n(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions.

    "summary": "Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted\nsignificant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach\n- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for\nheterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph\nheterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response\nvaries across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic\ncorrelation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed\nfilter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve\nexpressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a\nheterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily\ndegree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters\nto fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals\nthat the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not\nfollow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to\nguarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a\nsimple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily\nspectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD\nNAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over\nleading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.",

    "summary": "Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied\nuniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We\nargue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide\nbenefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we\nreframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show\nthat performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each\nexcelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage\nthis finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and\nContext-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's\nprediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive\nper-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are\nnon-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective\nthat compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the\nGNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance\nacross node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up\nto $+13\\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our\nfindings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,\nwhere selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs\nwithout incurring high computational costs.",

Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically\nanonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple\nmasking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.\nConsequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal\nmasking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents\nAEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration\nfor machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We\nintroduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a\nmetric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after\nmasking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)\nor none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable\nfor scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To\nachieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative\nproportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation\nquantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square.

    "summary": "Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods\noften face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and\nleveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to\ndifferent geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,\nwhereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information\nbut are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across\ndiverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework\ngeneralizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods\nthrough the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction\nreveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more\nadvanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP\nand SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this\nframework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale\ninvariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and\nsufficient conditions under generalized norms.

    "summary": "In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to\nmodeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock\ndependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages\nduring macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an\nattention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic\ncontext via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.\nCentral to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling\nrapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range\nmulti-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to\nweigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal\ndynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms\nexisting stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating\nstrong robustness during the COVID-19 period.",

Existing Persian speech\ndatasets are typically smaller than their English counterparts, which creates a\nkey limitation for developing Persian speech technologies. We address this gap\nby introducing ParsVoice, the largest Persian speech corpus designed\nspecifically for TTS applications. We created an automated pipeline that\ntransforms raw audiobook content into TTS-ready data, incorporating components\nsuch as a BERT-based sentence completion detector, a binary search boundary\noptimization method for precise audio-text alignment, and multi-dimensional\nquality assessment frameworks tailored to Persian. The pipeline processes 2,000\naudiobooks, yielding 3,526 hours of clean speech, which was further filtered\ninto a 1,804-hour high-quality subset suitable for TTS, featuring more than 470\nspeakers. ParsVoice is the largest high-quality Persian speech dataset,\noffering speaker diversity and audio quality comparable to major English\ncorpora. The complete dataset has been made publicly available to accelerate\nthe development of Persian speech technologies and to serve as a template for\nother low-resource languages.

    "summary": "Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization,\nediting, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients\nas inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent\nworks explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use\narchitectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing,\nlimiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach\nfor designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by\nthree principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation\nsymmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to\ncapture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation\nthrough rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce\nGradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from\nsimple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and\nshow that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based\nfunctions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness\non a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as\nlearned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to\nfine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch\nbetween stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers\nused during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE\nsamplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on\ndeterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy\ninduces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can\nbe expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this\nreward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along\nwith sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance\nPreserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized\ndenoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily\nhigh levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.\nEmpirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image\nmodels using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group\nrelative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently\nnarrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated\nusing higher-stochasticity SDE training.",

Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured\nby high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across\ndownstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what\nconstitutes \"diversity\" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific\nnotion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to\ninconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across\ndifferent approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity\nunexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity\nthat translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --\nallowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We\ndemonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,\na unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills.

However, these\nalgorithms rely on the presence of underlying patterns in the data, and their\nidentification often depends heavily on human expertise. Misinterpreting these\npatterns can lead to model misspecification, resulting in increased\ngeneralization error and degraded performance. The recently proposed evolving\npattern (EvoRate) metric addresses this by using the mutual information between\nthe next data point and its past to guide regression order estimation and\nfeature selection. Building on this idea, we introduce a general framework\nbased on predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the\npast and the future, $I(X_{past}; X_{future})$. This quantity naturally defines\nan information-theoretic learning curve, which quantifies the amount of\npredictive information available as the observation window grows. Using this\nformalism, we show that the presence or absence of temporal patterns\nfundamentally constrains the learnability of sequential models: even an optimal\npredictor cannot outperform the intrinsic information limit imposed by the\ndata.

    "summary": "We propose a novel optimization framework for computing the medial axis\ntransform that simultaneously preserves the medial structure and ensures high\nmedial mesh quality. The medial structure, consisting of interconnected sheets,\nseams, and junctions, provides a natural volumetric decomposition of a 3D\nshape. Our method introduces a structure-aware, particle-based optimization\npipeline guided by the restricted power diagram (RPD), which partitions the\ninput volume into convex cells whose dual encodes the connectivity of the\nmedial mesh. Structure-awareness is enforced through a spherical quadratic\nerror metric (SQEM) projection that constrains the movement of medial spheres,\nwhile a Gaussian kernel energy encourages an even spatial distribution.\nCompared to feature-preserving methods such as MATFP and MATTopo, our approach\nproduces cleaner and more accurate medial structures with significantly\nimproved mesh quality. In contrast to voxel-based, point-cloud-based, and\nvariational methods, our framework is the first to integrate structural\nawareness into the optimization process, yielding medial meshes with superior\ngeometric fidelity, topological correctness, and explicit structural\ndecomposition.",

Yet, it can be difficult to tune\ndesired robot behaviors due to unintuitive and complex reward design. In\ncomparison, offline trajectory optimization methods, like Hybrid Zero Dynamics,\noffer more tuneable, interpretable, and mathematically grounded motion plans\nfor high-dimensional legged systems. However, these methods often remain\nbrittle to real-world disturbances like external perturbations.\n  In this work, we present NaviGait, a hierarchical framework that combines the\nstructure of trajectory optimization with the adaptability of RL for robust and\nintuitive locomotion control. NaviGait leverages a library of offline-optimized\ngaits and smoothly interpolates between them to produce continuous reference\nmotions in response to high-level commands. The policy provides both\njoint-level and velocity command residual corrections to modulate and stabilize\nthe reference trajectories in the gait library. One notable advantage of\nNaviGait is that it dramatically simplifies reward design by encoding rich\nmotion priors from trajectory optimization, reducing the need for finely tuned\nshaping terms and enabling more stable and interpretable learning. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that NaviGait enables faster training compared\nto conventional and imitation-based RL, and produces motions that remain\nclosest to the original reference. Overall, by decoupling high-level motion\ngeneration from low-level correction, NaviGait offers a more scalable and\ngeneralizable approach for achieving dynamic and robust locomotion.",
