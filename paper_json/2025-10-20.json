    "title": "Unbiased Gradient Low-Rank Projection",
    "summary": "Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large\nlanguage models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank\nprojection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a\nrepresentative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is\ntheir lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches\nintroduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,\nwhich contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.\nAiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling\ntechnique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an\ninstantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank\noptimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named\nGaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the\nconvergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory\nefficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and\npretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even\nbetter performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows\nthat the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution\nof knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model\nparameter space and better memorization.",

However, recent work has largely focused on applying\nnew methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators,\nshying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus\non data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation\ntasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification,\nand single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With\nour data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family\nof 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative\nrejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges\nlarger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for\nopen-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static\nbenchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers,\nFARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training,\nFARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs.\nstring-matching verifiers.

    "summary": "Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving\nremains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to\nidentify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its\ncorresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current\nretrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using\nthe informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:\ninformal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on\nthe underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel\nframework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into\nsmaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval\nof premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT\nretrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in\nformalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,\nConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise\nretrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on\nProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the\nout-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and\n42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that\nretrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on\nmodel-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive\nretrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.",

    "summary": "Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in\nlanguage models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly\nunderstood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.\npresident or an API call) does not \"average out\" by recalling another. Hence,\nwe propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when\nbackward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before\npost-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to\nquantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects\nand obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add\nchance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random\nguessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across\npost-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis\nshows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with\nlow-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base\nmodels and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on\nmath and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to\ninstruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both\nforgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed\nand warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not\nreliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical\nyardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --\nenabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.",

    "summary": "Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly\nimproves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is\nchallenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class\ndifferences. Many deep learning models operate as \"black boxes,\" limiting\nclinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based\nframework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to\nenhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and\ninterpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates\n(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment\nlesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the\noriginal image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via\nmulti-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on\nsalient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module\nincorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We\nevaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019\nchallenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation\nperformance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC\ncompared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use\nGradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.\nThese visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the\nlesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These\nresults demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical\ndata with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable\nskin cancer classification model.",

Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the\nvisual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term\n``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families.

In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase\nwith thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML\nmodel trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the\ndynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we\ndevelop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical\nknowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical\nInformation-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics\nloss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV\nand SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the\ndaily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of\nsamples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and\nearly freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.",

    "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have sparse, event driven processing that can\nleverage neuromorphic applications. In this work, we introduce a\nmulti-threading kernel that enables neuromorphic applications running at the\nedge, meaning they process sensory input directly and without any up-link to or\ndependency on a cloud service. The kernel shows speed-up gains over single\nthread processing by a factor of four on moderately sized SNNs and 1.7X on a\nSynfire network. Furthermore, it load-balances all cores available on\nmulti-core processors, such as ARM, which run today's mobile devices and is up\nto 70% more energy efficient compared to statical core assignment. The present\nwork can enable the development of edge applications that have low Size,\nWeight, and Power (SWaP), and can prototype the integration of neuromorphic\nchips.",

    "summary": "The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence\n(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research\ncalls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the\nexisting explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer\ninterpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a\nmodel's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current\ncounterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including\ngradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the\nalignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation\nalgorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable\nand informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries\ndiverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to\nmodels with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop\nsystems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that\nrequire the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We\nprovide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that\nLeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations\nthat offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable\ncounterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially\nused as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly\napplicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert\ninterpretability.",

Conventional fine-tuning methods\nsuffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while\nexisting parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task\nscenarios.

Many approaches have tried\nto support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;\nhowever, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack\nof sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient\ndata. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease\nthat consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing\ntype(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required\nfeatures from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the\nprevious two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each\nimage into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting\nfeatures and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final\nclassification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from\neach chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top\nperforming state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On\nthe NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen\npatients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap\nof only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in\nprior work.",

On\nthe other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on\nempirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ\nmulti-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the\nabove issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to\nanalyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new\ninteraction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that\nis applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance\ncan be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference\ntechnique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the\ntargeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class\nof causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary\ntask goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the\ncorresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance\ngraph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning\nparadigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm.

Inspired by these critical\nproblems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts\nboosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold\nideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.\nMoreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which\nenables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load\nbalancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability\nof high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained\nweights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address\nthe issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning.

    "title": "PICABench: How Far Are We from Physically Realistic Image Editing?",
    "summary": "Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing\nmodels could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original\ncontent. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying\nphysical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing\nan object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with\nnearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on\ninstruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,\nhow far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we\nintroduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across\neight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for\nmost of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We\nfurther propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses\nVLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.\nBeyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics\nfrom videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most\nof the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a\nchallenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and\nproposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive\ncontent editing toward physically consistent realism.",

    "summary": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by\ndetecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot\nperformance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often\ncompromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical\ndownstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish\nbetween fine-grained classes such as \"fishing boat\" and \"yacht\" since their\nembeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user\ngoals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.\nTo address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad\ngeneralization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot\nclassifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate\nhigh-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high\nprecision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of\nuser-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery\nannotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning\nstrategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME\nidentifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision\nboundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample\ndiversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without\ncostly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then\na minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our\nmethod consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,\nestablishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting\nfoundation models to specific user needs.",

The model scores all\ncandidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when\nthe list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a\ncurriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong\neffectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45,\nnDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56,\nnDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains\nunder the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and\nflexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain\nwhen it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective\ngeneration buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design\nsimplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend\nmore on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond\nclinical order selection.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a\nwide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative\nabilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,\nsuch as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper\ninvestigates the key question: \\textit{Can LLMs be effectively applied to\npsychological counseling?} To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on\nthe role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it\nmeets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass\nthe U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as\na human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must\ndemonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required\nfor such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychCounsel-Bench, a benchmark\ngrounded in U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for\nprofessional counselors that requires about 70\\% accuracy to pass.\nPsychCounsel-Bench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated\nsingle-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough\nto cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a\ncomprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our\nevaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and\nGemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source\nmodels (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results\nsuggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling\nexam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing\npsychology-oriented LLMs. We release the proposed dataset for public use:\nhttps://github.com/cloversjtu/PsychCounsel-Bench",

    "summary": "Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions\nchange over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series\nforecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two\nfactors, \\ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static\nand dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often\nconflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the\ncombined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal\nperformance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively\npropose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time\nseries forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two\ncomplementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel\nglobal embedding module that learns persistent representations across time\nseries, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient\nfrequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in\nsignal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational\nresources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to\nverify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight\nframework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple\nintegration.

Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires\nmore than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level\nand structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely\ntokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed\nsteps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial\nin solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller\nlanguage models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities\nof a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to\ndeploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and\nproblem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution\npathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem\ndefinitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware\nloss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation\nand to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.\nExperimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap\nand simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model\nin terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across\nthe MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.",

To train a robust model for\nmulti-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various\nmedical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing\nacross institutions.

To answer this question, we evaluate over 20\nopen-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including\nmath, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard\ninstruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in\nmath fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this\nphenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using\nmath-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space\nrepresentation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT\ninduces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves\ngeneral-domain structure.

This allows the model to unify both multi-data\nand multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of\nspatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt\nlearning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and\ntask-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across\nvarious urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three advantages: 1) It unifies\ndiverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential\nformat; 2) With task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks,\nincluding bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation,\nspatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes\neffectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities\noutperforming nearly all baselines with training data.

    "title": "RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase\n  Generation",
    "summary": "Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single\nfiles of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a\nfundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software\nsystems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of\nautomated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels:\ndeciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their\nimplementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on\nnatural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications,\nmisaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and\nlack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository\nPlanning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities,\nfile structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing\nfree-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent\nlong-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop\nZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages:\nproposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided\ncode generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a\nbenchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo\nproduces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\\times$\nlarger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\\times$ larger than\nother baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving\nover Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG\nmodels complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through\nnear-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus\naccelerating localization.",

    "summary": "In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems,\nconstrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be\ncarefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning\nprovides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being\na popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially\ndepends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, which governs the\ntrade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update\nthe multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in\npractice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an\nautomated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we\nanalyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe\nreinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\\lambda$-profiles\nthat give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and\nconstraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly\nsensitive nature of $\\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general\nintuition for choosing the optimal value $\\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally\nshow that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even\nexceed the optimal performance found at $\\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference\nin their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier\nupdates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated\nthrough PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to\nachieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need\nfor further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement\nlearning.

The most common fine-tuning method\nis to update pretrained weights via low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Existing\ninitialization strategies for LoRA often rely on singular value decompositions\n(SVD) of gradients or weight matrices.

To this\nend, we introduce Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA), an initialization scheme\nthat uses the directions capturing the most activation variance, provably\nmaximizing the expected gradient signal and accelerating fine-tuning. EVA\nperforms incremental SVD on minibatches of activation vectors and selects the\nright-singular vectors for initialization once they converged. Further, by\nselecting the directions that capture the most activation-variance for a given\nrank budget, EVA accommodates adaptive ranks that reduce the number of\ntrainable parameters. We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks as\nlanguage generation and understanding, image classification, and reinforcement\nlearning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the\nhighest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the\nnumber of trainable parameters through rank redistribution. In summary, EVA\nestablishes a new Pareto frontier compared to existing LoRA initialization\nschemes in both accuracy and efficiency.",

By\nunifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to\neconomic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the\nnecessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM\nsimulations succeed or fail.

Solving sparse-reward tasks is RL's core premise, requiring\nefficient exploration coupled with long-horizon credit assignment, and\novercoming these challenges is key for building self-improving agents with\nsuperhuman ability. Prior work commonly explores with the objective of solving\nmany sparse-reward tasks, making exploration of individual high-dimensional,\nlong-horizon tasks intractable. We argue that solving such challenging tasks\nrequires solving simpler tasks that are relevant to the target task, i.e.,\nwhose achieval will teach the agent skills required for solving the target\ntask. We demonstrate that this sense of direction, necessary for effective\nexploration, can be extracted from existing RL algorithms, without leveraging\nany prior information. To this end, we propose a method for directed\nsparse-reward goal-conditioned very long-horizon RL (DISCOVER), which selects\nexploratory goals in the direction of the target task. We connect DISCOVER to\nprincipled exploration in bandits, formally bounding the time until the target\ntask becomes achievable in terms of the agent's initial distance to the target,\nbut independent of the volume of the space of all tasks.

More\nrecently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models\n(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to\nhandcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled\nprompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations\ninto high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,\ndataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During\ninference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their\ndescriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries\nof adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This\ncontextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global\ncoherence without parameter tuning.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural\nlanguage processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems\nremains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue,\noften manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes,\nlimits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we\npropose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain\nExplanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the\nreasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and\nprocesses. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic\nrelation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate\nattribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At\ninference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable\nscenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting\nplausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design\nenables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern.\nThrough extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that\nKG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6%\nand F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1%\nin F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such\nas medicine.

First, we\npresent an original survey of software developers in Silicon Valley,\ninterrogating how coder worldviews, ethics, and workplace cultures shape the\ndemocratic potential and social impact of the technologies they build. Results\nindicate that while most developers recognize the power of their products to\ninfluence civil liberties and political discourse, they often face ethical\ndilemmas and top-down pressures that can lead to design choices undermining\ndemocratic ideals. Second, we critically investigate these findings in the\ncontext of an emerging new digital divide, not of internet access but of\ninformation quality. We interrogate the survey findings in the context of the\nSlop Economy, in which billions of users unable to pay for high-quality content\nexperience an internet dominated by low-quality, AI-generated ad-driven\ncontent. We find a reinforcing cycle between tech creator beliefs and the\ndigital ecosystems they spawn. We discuss implications for democratic\ngovernance, arguing for more ethically informed design and policy interventions\nto help bridge the digital divide to ensure that technological innovation\nsupports rather than subverts democratic values in the next chapter of the\ndigital age.",

    "summary": "Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models\nfor its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing\noccupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which\ninherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place\nclassification\" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic\nand continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,\na novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,\npowered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception\nmodule, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and\nenriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range\nperception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a\nState-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based\nforecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic\nqueries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically\ndevise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and\nefficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning\ntasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the\nadvantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and\nefficiency.

We address two core\nchallenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional\nheterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to\nreduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency\nto strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware\nmulti-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates\nprototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder\ntoward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware\nsource weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically\nestimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions.

    "summary": "Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during\ntraining, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill\ncomposition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model\n(RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through\nrecursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and\nevaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution\ngeneralization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and\ncross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with\ntask complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution\ntasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios.\nMechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization\nduring training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal\ncomponent analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers\ndevelop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized\nlayers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular,\ninterpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal\nalgorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.",

Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories,\nincluding human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that\nhuman-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly\nrely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing\nattention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities. However,\nthey generally evaluate the generated code based on static prompts, and tend to\nfail for complex code scenarios which typically involve multiple requirements\nand require more contextual information. In addition, these approaches lack\nfine-grained evaluation for complex code, resulting in limited explainability.\nTo mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first agent-based\nevaluation framework for complex code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two\nstages: (1) Requirement-guided multi-dimensional context distillation stage and\n(2) Fine-grained scoring and summarization stage. A comprehensive evaluation\nreport is also generated for enhanced explainability. For validation, we\nconstruct a new benchmark consisting of 363 samples spanning 37 coding\nscenarios and 23 programming languages.

    "summary": "Accurate atmospheric wind field information is crucial for various\napplications, including weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster risk\nreduction. However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains\nchallenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote\nsensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of\nnumerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a\nnovel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to forecast three-dimensional\n(3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks\n(FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and\nspatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics.\nOur preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in real-time wind\nforecasts (up to 30 minutes lead time). The model exhibits robustness across\nforecast horizons and different pressure levels, and its predictions for wind\nfields show superior agreement with ground-based radar wind profiler compared\nto concurrent European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)\nReanalysis v5 (ERA5). Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain\nexcellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly\nreduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its\ncost-effectiveness and scalability.

Lastly, we consider a generalization of the\nproblem, formulated using graphs, which captures the VC-dimension of both set\nsystems and graphs. We show that it is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized\nby the treewidth of the graph (which, in the case of set systems, applies to\nthe treewidth of its incidence graph).

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the\nreasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary\nfeedback. However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to\nevery token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,\nmaking it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or\nfailure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide\ncredit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable\nsignals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process\nReward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key\nlimitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback\nis unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in\nonline reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment\nPolicy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly\nleverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward\nModel (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based\non the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level\ncredits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based\nrewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting\nmechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive\nexperiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO\nconsistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning\nmethods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain\nbenchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the\nlearning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.",

We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end\nreinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly\nlayout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance,\nparagraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly\nreleased dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic\nscanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we\ninstantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called\nInfinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and\nformula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity,\noutpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We\nwill publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust\ndocument understanding.",

Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over\ndeclarative models in modelling complex environments.

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce $\\texttt{FBI}_\\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner\nexplicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.\n$\\texttt{FBI}_\\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define\nsemantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes\nmeaningfully different plans.

    "summary": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two\nmillennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language\nmodels (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic\nreasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain\nLLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal\nintegration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these\nlimitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,\nintegrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback\nrefinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning\nrather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and\nethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive\nknowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based\ninstruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation\nmechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process\ninvolving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for\ntongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic\naccess to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question\nbenchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior\naccuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,\nherb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an\ninteractive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000\nusers globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of\ndeveloping a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning\nand multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning\ngenerative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for\nreal-world deployment.",

We propose a heuristic\npost-processing module that aligns predicted keypoints to tooth boundaries\nusing an auxiliary instance segmentation model. An evaluation metric,\nPercentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), is proposed to capture\nkeypoint performance in dental imaging domains. Four donor pose estimation\nmodels were adapted with fine-tuning for our keypoint problem. Post-processing\nimproved fine-grained localisation, raising average PRCK^{0.05} by +0.028, but\nreduced coarse performance for PRCK^{0.25} by -0.0523 and PRCK^{0.5} by\n-0.0345. Orientation estimation shows excellent performance for auxiliary\nsegmentation when filtered with either stage 1 object detection model.\nPeriodontal staging was detected sufficiently, with the best mesial and distal\nDice scores of 0.508 and 0.489, while furcation involvement and widened\nperiodontal ligament space tasks remained challenging due to scarce positive\nsamples. Scalability is implied with similar validation and external set\nperformance. The annotation methodology enables stage agnostic training with\nbalanced representation across disease severities for some detection tasks. The\nPRCK metric provides a domain-specific alternative to generic pose metrics,\nwhile the heuristic post-processing module consistently corrected implausible\npredictions with occasional catastrophic failures.

This paper\ninvestigates the use of Q-learning, a well-known reinforcement learning\nalgorithm, for the passive inference of deterministic finite automata.

Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or\nweb-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the\nsimulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data\noften requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a\nRewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates\nthe unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training\ndata. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction\npairs can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to\npromote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched\nObservation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions,\nenabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via\nText-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast\nInstruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten\ninstructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and\nnew observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy\nwith a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data\ndistribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during\ntraining.

    "title": "Localist LLMs with Recruitment Learning",
    "summary": "We present a novel framework for training large language models with\ncontinuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum\nfrom localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,\nefficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable\nparameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both\ntraining and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an\ninformation-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic\nblocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at\ninitialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends\ncapacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity\narchitectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on\nattention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule\ninjection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood\nwith explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing\nexplicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on\nsemantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on\nattention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism\nprovides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained,\nwithin-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the\nsystem discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data\nencoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously\ninterpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting\narchitectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in\nregulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.",

    "title": "Towards Mixed-Modal Retrieval for Universal Retrieval-Augmented\n  Generation",
    "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for\nenhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an\nexternal corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text\ndocuments, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and\ndocuments may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this\npaper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to\nimprove vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified\nmixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate\nthe scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated\npipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct\nNyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that\nbetter reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality\ndataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform\npre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets,\nfollowed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream\nvision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative\npreferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs\ncompetitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more\ngeneral and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality\nin vision-language tasks.",

Prior work focuses on curriculum-based\ntraining schedules that structure data presentation by ordering or reweighting\ntraining examples from easy-to-hard to facilitate learning; however, existing\ncurricula are static, fixing the ordering or the weights before training and\nignoring that example difficulty and marginal utility evolve with the learned\nrepresentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Dynamic Dual-Signal\nCurriculum (DDSC), a training schedule that adapts the curriculum online by\ncombining two signals computed each epoch: a domain-invariance signal and a\nlearning-progress signal. A time-varying scheduler fuses these signals into\nper-example weights that prioritize domain-invariant examples in early epochs\nand progressively emphasize device-specific cases. DDSC is lightweight,\narchitecture-agnostic, and introduces no additional inference overhead.

However, existing methods still face challenges in\ngenerating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random\nperturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse\ncollaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore,\nexisting approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose\nstrong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal\ncontrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach\nnamed Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL).

These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate\npools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based\nretrieval.

By conditioning the\ngenerative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and\nvertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication\nmetadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These\nheterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,\nenabling fine-grained control over the generated images.

The incorporation of these synthetic samples,\nexemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model\naccuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,\ndirectly targeting model deficiencies.

We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based\nRL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL\napproaches underperformed DARIL--world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s\nwhile direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that\ndistribution matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL\nover potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations.\nThis challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making\nand provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.",

    "summary": "Text-Speech Language Models (TSLMs) -- language models trained to jointly\nprocess and generate text and speech -- are commonly trained through an early\nmodality fusion/fission approach, in which both modalities are fed and\npredicted from a shared backbone via linear layers. We hypothesize that this\napproach limits cross-modal transfer by neglecting feature compositionality --\nspecifically, the finer-grained nature of speech representations compared to\ntext -- preventing the emergence of a shared feature hierarchy within model\nlayers. In this paper, we argue that this limitation can be addressed through\nlate fusion and fission, with a fission process that accesses both high- and\nlow-level features for speech generation. Our models implementing these\nprinciples, SmolTolk, rival or surpass state-of-the-art TSLMs trained with\norders of magnitude more compute, and achieve significantly improved\ncross-modal performance relative to early fusion/fission baselines.\nRepresentation analyses further suggest that our method enhances the model's\nability to abstract higher-level, more semantic features from speech, and leads\nto increasingly shared representation spaces across layers.",

    "summary": "The increasing demand for long-context modeling in large language models\n(LLMs) is bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of the standard\nself-attention mechanism. The community has proposed sparse attention to\nmitigate this issue. However, position-aware sparse attention methods rely on\nstatic sparse structures that lack adaptability to diverse query contexts,\nwhile content-aware sparse attention methods depend on heuristic key-value\nselection, hindering full differentiability. We introduce a trainable dynamic\nmask sparse attention mechanism, a method that merges the advantages of both\nposition-aware and content-aware approaches. Dynamic Mask Attention (DMA)\nachieves this through three key innovations: First, it leverages value vector\nrepresentations to generate content-aware dynamic masks, enabling the model to\nadaptively identify and attend to critical information. Second, it computes\nposition-aware sparse weights in a hardware-friendly manner, efficiently\nskipping unnecessary computational regions. Finally, we demonstrate that the\nintroduced dynamic mask and sparse weights do not obstruct gradients,\nsupporting end-to-end training. We have validated the performance of DMA\nthrough comprehensive experiments. A large body of experimental evidence shows\nthat DMA consistently holds a Pareto advantage over state-of-the-art sparse\nattention baselines in tasks including scaling laws, multi-query associative\nrecall, standard benchmarks, and needle in a haystack tests, while also\ndelivering up to a 10x overall speedup.

    "summary": "Spatio-temporal data captures complex dynamics across both space and time,\nyet traditional visualizations are complex, require domain expertise and often\nfail to resonate with broader audiences. Here, we propose MapMuse, a\nstorytelling-based framework for interpreting spatio-temporal datasets,\ntransforming them into compelling, narrative-driven experiences. We utilize\nlarge language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and\nagent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles\ncommon in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection,\nand audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi\ntrajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a\nheat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban\nmobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi\njourney, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying\nlocations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling\ndrives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The\ncase study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity\nand human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to\nthe potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective\ncommunication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open\nproblems and opportunities for future research.",

Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most\neffectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient\nuse of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search\nas a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy\nthat maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed\nrollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of\nexisting search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning\ndirections with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and\ninefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented\nResource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias\nby decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources\nat the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct\nextensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks\nincluding MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025.

    "summary": "This study introduces a novel framework for analysing and mitigating media\nbias by tracing partisan stances to their linguistic roots in emotional\nlanguage. We posit that partisan bias is not merely an abstract stance but\nmaterialises as quantifiable 'emotional fingerprints' within news texts. These\nfingerprints are systematically measured using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance\n(VAD) framework, allowing us to decode the affective strategies behind partisan\nframing. Our analysis of the Allsides dataset confirms this hypothesis,\nrevealing distinct and statistically significant emotional fingerprints for\nleft, centre, and right-leaning media. Based on this evidence-driven approach,\nwe then propose a computational approach to mitigation through NeutraSum, a\nmodel designed to neutralise these identified emotional patterns. By explicitly\ntargeting the VAD characteristics of biased language, NeutraSum generates\nsummaries that are not only coherent but also demonstrably closer to an\nemotionally neutral baseline. Experimental results validate our framework:\nNeutraSum successfully erases the partisan emotional fingerprints from its\nsummaries, achieving a demonstrably lower emotional bias score than other\nmodels. This work pioneers a new path for bias mitigation, shifting the focus\nfrom treating symptoms (political labels) to addressing the cause: the\nemotional encoding of partisan bias in language.",

    "summary": "Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for\nhigh-quality discrete data but typically suffer from slow sampling speeds due\nto their reliance on iterative decoding processes. This reliance on a\nmulti-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs,\nwhich is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we\nanalyze the factorization approximation error using Conditional Total\nCorrelation (TC), and reveal its dependence on the coupling. To address the\nchallenge of efficient few-step generation, we propose Rectified Discrete Flow\n(ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces the underlying factorization\nerror (measured as Conditional TC) by rectifying the coupling between source\nand target distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees\na monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically,\nReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for\ntraining efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple\nand theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge,\nproviding a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis.

This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion\nanalysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we\nanalyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the\ndominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear\ndominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,\nand significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed\nacross outlets.

However, existing methods\nmainly focus on coarse-grained tasks, with limitations in addressing modality\nentanglement in fine-grained continual learning settings. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce a novel Continual Audio-Visual Segmentation (CAVS) task, aiming to\ncontinuously segment new classes guided by audio. Through comprehensive\nanalysis, two critical challenges are identified: 1) multi-modal semantic\ndrift, where a sounding objects is labeled as background in sequential tasks;\n2) co-occurrence confusion, where frequent co-occurring classes tend to be\nconfused. In this work, a Collision-based Multi-modal Rehearsal (CMR) framework\nis designed to address these challenges.

    "summary": "Practical control systems pose significant challenges in identifying optimal\ncontrol policies due to uncertainties in the system model and external\ndisturbances. While $H_\\infty$ control techniques are commonly used to design\nrobust controllers that mitigate the effects of disturbances, these methods\noften require complex and computationally intensive calculations. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm called\nrobust deterministic policy gradient (RDPG), which formulates the $H_\\infty$\ncontrol problem as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game. In this formulation, one\nplayer (the user) aims to minimize the cost, while the other player (the\nadversary) seeks to maximize it. We then employ deterministic policy gradient\n(DPG) and its deep reinforcement learning counterpart to train a robust control\npolicy with effective disturbance attenuation. In particular, for practical\nimplementation, we introduce an algorithm called robust deep deterministic\npolicy gradient (RDDPG), which employs a deep neural network architecture and\nintegrates techniques from the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient\n(TD3) to enhance stability and learning efficiency. To evaluate the proposed\nalgorithm, we implement it on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasked with\nfollowing a predefined path in a disturbance-prone environment. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other\ncontrol approaches in terms of robustness against disturbances, enabling\nprecise real-time tracking of moving targets even under severe disturbance\nconditions.",

    "summary": "Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's\ndisease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health\nrecords (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2\ndiabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely\ninterventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn\ncontinuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event\nsamples and patient heterogeneity (\\eg different progression rates and\npathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack\nadaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex\ncontinuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on\nclinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and\nlearns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework.\nTD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the\ninterdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and\ninter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets\ndemonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the\nprogression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.",

The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their\ninnovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training,\nwhich make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By\nintegrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic\nopportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with\nstrong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure\nenables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence,\nthis survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based\nLLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques\nbehind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding\nDeepSeek-style LLM integration. Next, we examine recent advancements in\nRL-based LLMs, using DeepSeek models as a representative example. Building on\nthis, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations,\nchallenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions\nfor integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and\nneural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents.

    "summary": "Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling,\noffering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their\nability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster\ngeneration and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based\nlanguage models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively\nprocessing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask\nor replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards\nvaluable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically\nblends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$\npredicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This\nprovides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from\nearlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to\npropagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a\npretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate\nthat continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved\nperplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art\ndiffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM.

Each year, they swallow whole villages and\nvast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing\nthousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,\nbeen a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful\ngeneral-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted\nto this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset\n- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of\nBangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur\nUnion, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,\nthis dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements\nthat have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple\ncolor-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and\nthen fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of\nriverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this\ndestructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a\nDice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional\nmethods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key\ncontributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in\nBangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this\ncritical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual\nevidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which\npolicymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate\nits trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.",

This stems from plankton's complex\nmorphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel\nspecies, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid\nadvancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton\nrecognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision\ndevelopments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address\nthis, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating\nvarious distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset\n\\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection\nmethods.

    "summary": "Adversarial attacks on deep learning models have received increased attention\nin recent years. Work in this area has mostly focused on gradient-based\ntechniques, so-called 'white-box' attacks, where the attacker has access to the\ntargeted model's internal parameters; such an assumption is usually untenable\nin the real world. Additionally, some attacks use the entire pixel space to\nfool a given model, which is neither practical nor physical. To accommodate\nthese problems we propose the BBNP algorithm (Black-Box Naturalistic Patch): a\ndirect, black-box, naturalistic, gradient-free method that uses the learned\nimage manifold of a pretrained, generative adversarial network (GAN) to\ngenerate naturalistic adversarial patches for object detectors. This method\nperforms model-agnostic black-box naturalistic attacks on object detection\nmodels by relying solely on the outputs of the model. Comparing our approach\nagainst five models, five black-box and two white-box attacks, we show that our\nproposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming all other\ntested black-box approaches.",

The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage\ntraining process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with\nover 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and\ngeneralizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model\napplicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required.\nExtensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific\nRAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance\nwhile maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws,\nhighlighting its potential for further improvement.",

    "summary": "Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial\ninfarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early\nidentification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have\nlimited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the\ninterpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a\nhybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram\n(ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to\nimprove both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings\nfrom AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder\nmodel was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features ,\nwhich were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost\nclassifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the\nSHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid\nmodel achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC\n0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that\nmodel-identified key features, such as \"premature ventricular complexes\" (risk\npredictor) and \"normal sinus rhythm\" (protective factor), were highly\nconsistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework\nprovides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of\nfoundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for\nbuilding trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.",

Discrete diffusion language\nmodels (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of\nsteps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex\nreasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid\narchitectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration\ncan yield complementary benefits.

However, current\nmulti-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately\ninferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning\ncapabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel\ntwo-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:\nsimultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and\nencouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during\nsupervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense\ngeometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel\ninput. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide\ncomplementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry\nfrom 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a\ngroup length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes\nthe generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling\nsequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize\ntraining. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,\nconsistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,\ngeometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.",

    "summary": "Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications\nranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive\nexperiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL\nprotocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in\nage accuracy and identity consistency.

    "title": "On Task Vectors and Gradients",
    "summary": "Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model\nmerging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.\nDespite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when\nit works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for\ntask arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients\nof the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector\ngenerated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative\ngradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical\nmulti-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a\nsecond-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our\nempirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,\ndemonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory\nin both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned\nfor only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully\nconverged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of\napproximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its\neffectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in\nmodel merging.",

Instead, they are characterized by interwoven\nand often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional\ntendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about\nusage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM\nmust go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source\nsignals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar\nto how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex,\nuncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no\nlarge-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human\nintent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world\npublic discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline.

    "summary": "Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a\ncrucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,\nand in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our\nresearch is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning\nmodels through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic\nframework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical\nmodeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay\nbetween residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper\nfocuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most\nbasic form of supervised learning. By defining two Lawvere-enriched categories\ncorresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors\nbetween them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.\nWe show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we\ncall the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of\ninformation can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations\nin parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the\nparameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits\nby the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an\ninstance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and\npropose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer\nscience as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but\nthis generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are\nrequired, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these\nscenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much\nof what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a\nfundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information\nthrough conversation?\n  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating\nlatent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden\nuser attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three\nprogressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized\nQuestion Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a\ntri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of\nelicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed\nsurface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically\nwith context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number\nof hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework\nfor studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,\nhighlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for\nbuilding truly adaptive AI systems.",

    "summary": "Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for\nsynthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the\nperformance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on\nperturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and\ninsufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To\naddress these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that\ndirectly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using\noff-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level\nguidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to\nreduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel\nspace. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the\nclassifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,\nthis dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample\ngeneration. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively\ncombines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We\nperform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the\neffectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by\nGOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.",

This study investigates how\nLLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through\ncontinuation and response tasks using three open-source models: Gemma, Llama3\nand Llama3.3 and one commercial Model:Claude. By analyzing climate change\ndiscussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions,\nintensity patterns, and semantic consistency between human-authored and\nLLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high\nsemantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: these models show\na strong tendency to moderate negative emotions. When the input text carries\nnegative emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, or sadness, LLM tends to\ngenerate content with more neutral emotions, or even convert them into positive\nemotions such as joy or surprise. At the same time, we compared the\nLLM-generated content with human-authored content. The four models\nsystematically generated responses with reduced emotional intensity and showed\na preference for neutral rational emotions in the response task. In addition,\nthese models all maintained a high semantic similarity with the original text,\nalthough their performance in the continuation task and the response task was\ndifferent. These findings provide deep insights into the emotion and semantic\nprocessing capabilities of LLM, which are of great significance for its\ndeployment in social media environments and human-computer interaction design.",

    "title": "Structured Debate Improves Corporate Credit Reasoning in Financial AI",
    "summary": "Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning\nremains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative\nnon-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes\nyet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical\nprediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required\nin professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two\noperational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate\nstructured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a\nnon-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis\nthrough a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based\nmulti-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification\nthrough a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's\ncritical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate\ncases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to\nmanual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains\n(NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The\nKPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median\nratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs.\n3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured\nmulti-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in\nfinancial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit\nassessment.",

    "summary": "The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has\nincreased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However,\ntraditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models,\nmaking it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse\napplications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \\textit{Residual\nAlignment Model} (\\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type\nof importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves\nas the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as\nsecondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an\nestimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment\nof the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility\nand scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level\ntraining strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the\nproposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative\ntoken-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in\ncomparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs\nacross diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and\npreference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nbaseline models.",

While effective\nfor high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited\ntraining efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision\ntasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack\nof clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis\nconfirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and\nunderstanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent\ndiffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent\ndiffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages\nself-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature\nspace with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,\nwhile a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for\nhigh-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this\nsemantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As\na result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step\nsampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show\nthat SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the\nunderlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway\ntoward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

This paper introduces Malicious Token\nInjection (MTI), a modular framework that systematically perturbs cached key\nvectors at selected layers and timesteps through controlled magnitude and\nfrequency, using additive Gaussian noise, zeroing, and orthogonal rotations. A\ntheoretical analysis quantifies how these perturbations propagate through\nattention, linking logit deviations to the Frobenius norm of corruption and\nsoftmax Lipschitz dynamics. Empirical results show that MTI significantly\nalters next-token distributions and downstream task performance across GPT-2\nand LLaMA-2/7B, as well as destabilizes retrieval-augmented and agentic\nreasoning pipelines.

This opacity prevents\ntargeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static\ngraph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime\nchanges; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across\nmultiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with\nnetwork contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on\nanomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.\n  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks\nthat provide built-in interpretability.

In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a\ncompelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under\nthe assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal\ndecision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors\ndue to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned\ntendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to\navoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's\nreasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We\ninvestigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in\nsystematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications\nfor violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond\nbeing an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated\nreasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges\ncan fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be\npersuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear\ninstructions.

Traditional uncertainty\nquantification methods rely on a predefined confidence threshold to classify\npredictions as confident or uncertain. However, this approach assumes that\npredictions exceeding the threshold are trustworthy, while those below it are\nuncertain, without explicitly assessing the correctness of high-confidence\npredictions. As a result, confidently incorrect predictions may still occur,\nleading to misleading uncertainty assessments. To address this limitation, this\nstudy proposed an uncertainty-aware stacked neural network, which extends\nconventional uncertainty quantification by learning when predictions should be\ntrusted. The framework consists of a two-tier model: the base model generates\npredictions with uncertainty estimates, while the meta-model learns to assign a\ntrust flag, distinguishing confidently correct cases from those requiring\nexpert review. The proposed approach is evaluated against the traditional\nthreshold-based method across multiple confidence thresholds and pre-trained\narchitectures using the COVIDx CXR-4 dataset.

In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as\na signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of\nmicro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process\ngrounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or\nthinking through an answer). We further observe that once this \"thinking\"\nprocess is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by\nreducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more\ncertain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,\ntheoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at\ninference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during\ninference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the\nvalue cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable\ncontroller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any\ndataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration\nand exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our\nproposed method achieves significant improvements over the base\ninstruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the\ngap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any\ntraining, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced\nby 58.6% compared to the RL model.",

Despite\nadvances in robotic platforms, existing systems are predominantly follow-leader\nin nature, requiring continuous physician input and lacking intelligent\nautonomy.

This work moves towards\nautonomous catheter navigation by introducing DINO-CVA, a multimodal\ngoal-conditioned behavior cloning framework. The proposed model fuses visual\nobservations and joystick kinematics into a joint embedding space, enabling\npolicies that are both vision-aware and kinematic-aware.

A robotic experimental setup with a\nsynthetic vascular phantom was designed to collect multimodal datasets and\nevaluate performance.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse\napplications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their\nplug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with\nthese models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated\ninto various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are\ngrowing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts\n(e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack),\nwhile the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work\nbridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack\nvector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons\nsystem prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and\nmodel responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies\nin various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and\nreasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without\nrequiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks,\nincluding those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language\nprocessing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective\neven when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like\nchain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and\nretrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for\nimproving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened\nin their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.",

When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the\nschedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed\nworst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well\nfor LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained\nresource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a\nfair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel\nscheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a\nbottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the\nservice cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses\na simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand\nprediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing\nalgorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay.\nWe have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving\ndiverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling\nefficiency with fairness preserved.",

    "summary": "The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered\nambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing\nmethods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based\napproaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to\nnoise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global\npatterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal\ndynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)\nfail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation\nviews, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive\nAlignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an\nend-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via\nSequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via\ncross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific\ndiscriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence\nencoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image\nrepresentations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective\nfor end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on\nthree CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on\nMilan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to\nsensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for\nreliable ADL recognition in smart homes.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) represent substantial intellectual and economic\ninvestments, yet their effectiveness can inadvertently facilitate model\nimitation via knowledge distillation (KD). In practical scenarios, competitors\ncan distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly\naccessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by\nobservation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify\nimitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the\nteacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation\npurely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of\nactively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access.\nWe introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe)\nstrategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs are\naccurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for\ndistillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by\nfine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial\nloss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation\nattempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving the\nperformance of the teacher model, student models distilled from the defensively\ngenerated outputs demonstrate catastrophically reduced performance,\ndemonstrating DOGe as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.",

On the other hand, imposing hard\nconstraints on neural networks may hinder their representational power,\nadversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a\npractical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy\nhard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that\nmodify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with\nhard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our\nknowledge, HardNet is the first method that enables efficient and\ndifferentiable enforcement of more than one input-dependent inequality\nconstraint. It allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters\nusing standard algorithms by appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement\nlayer to the network's output. Furthermore, we show that HardNet retains neural\nnetworks' universal approximation capabilities.

Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale\natmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which\nexhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to\nobtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)\ndemonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve\nensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but\nthis method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency\nadequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex\nrelationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while\nmaintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer\npromising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study\nevaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification\nmechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models\ndistribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space\nsampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models\nare trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts\nto regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that\nprobabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty\nrepresentations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic\nmodel offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,\ndeterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish\nprobabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational\nsub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.",

    "title": "UltraCUA: A Foundation Model for Computer Use Agents with Hybrid Action",
    "summary": "Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions\n(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy\nexecution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.\nWhile other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,\ntools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We\npresent UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid\naction -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic\ntool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an\nautomated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,\nopen-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine\nproducing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use\nscenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection\nwith both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)\na two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online\nreinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and\nhigh-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA\nmodels achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while\nbeing 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on\nWindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming\nbaselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,\nreducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.",

    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend large language models with visual\nreasoning, but their multimodal design also introduces new, underexplored\nvulnerabilities. Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on\nbrittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow\nsubset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a\nvariational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as\nlearning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This\nprobabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial\ninputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to\napproximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks\nand providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further\nintegrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts\nthat embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces\nadversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM\nattention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and\nfrontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the\nbest baseline on GPT-4o.",

    "summary": "Language models often generate factually incorrect information unsupported by\ntheir training data, a phenomenon known as extrinsic hallucination. Existing\nmitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and\ndownstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online\nreinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward\n(RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach\nassigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually\ncorrect, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models\nacross diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3%\nreduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised\ntraining and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering,\nthe model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting \"I don't know\"\nwhen faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7%\nfewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these\nfactuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following,\nmath, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality,\ninduces quality regressions.",

This capability can also serve as a fundamental\nmechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with\nrefined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our\ncomprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no\nclear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response\nquality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose\nEVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the\nevolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore\noptimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement\ncapability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to\nfurther enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data\nfor training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference\nstages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it\nto better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of\nleveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic\nmodel abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability\nenables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3%\nlength-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on\nArena-Hard.

However, their scalability\nis limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging\ncoding problem training data.

Previous synthetic data generation\nmethods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting\nchallenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST,\na novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and\ndifficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized\ngenerators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators\ndemonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging\nproblems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate\nlarge-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong\nteacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning\nfor smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation\nexperiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after\nfine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we\nsurpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench.

Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning\npredominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC,\nwhich do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal\nreasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases,\nwith insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel\nframework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese\ntort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes\nused in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module\nreasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained\nsub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort\nlegal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to\nsystematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for\ntort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large\nlanguage models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our\nresults indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling\ncrucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several\nbaseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning\nthrough prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on\nadditional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and\nCriminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these\nbaselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in\ntort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis\ntasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning\nchains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often experience language confusion, which is\nthe unintended mixing of languages during text generation. Current solutions to\nthis problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate\nbetween harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces\nthe Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters\ntokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using\nnorm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and\napply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that\nlanguage confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the\ntop predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource\nlanguages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models,\nincluding Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion\nsignificantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting\ntask performance.

    "summary": "Language models are often evaluated with scalar metrics like accuracy, but\nsuch measures fail to capture how models internally represent ambiguity,\nespecially when human annotators disagree. We propose a topological perspective\nto analyze how fine-tuned models encode ambiguity and more generally instances.\n  Applied to RoBERTa-Large on the MD-Offense dataset, Mapper, a tool from\ntopological data analysis, reveals that fine-tuning restructures embedding\nspace into modular, non-convex regions aligned with model predictions, even for\nhighly ambiguous cases. Over $98\\%$ of connected components exhibit $\\geq 90\\%$\nprediction purity, yet alignment with ground-truth labels drops in ambiguous\ndata, surfacing a hidden tension between structural confidence and label\nuncertainty.\n  Unlike traditional tools such as PCA or UMAP, Mapper captures this geometry\ndirectly uncovering decision regions, boundary collapses, and overconfident\nclusters. Our findings position Mapper as a powerful diagnostic tool for\nunderstanding how models resolve ambiguity. Beyond visualization, it also\nenables topological metrics that may inform proactive modeling strategies in\nsubjective NLP tasks.",

We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that\naligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on\nthe MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary\nsurvival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural\nlanguage rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1)\nstandard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nprompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs\nto expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and\nMed42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and\nreduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and\npredictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore.

    "summary": "The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often\nnot accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing\ninterpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often\nrequire or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant\nlimitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like\nbackdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.\n  In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and\ncontrolling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations,\nthereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the\nunknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the\nweight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to\nnewly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations\nalong these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during\nfine-tuning with high precision.\n  For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger\nis present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate\nbelow 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on\nerased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to\nrecover \"unlearned\" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows\npotential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial\ninstruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover\nmodel-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney\nprompt generation.\n  Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/fjzzq2002/WeightWatch.",

    "summary": "Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced\nreasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement\nframeworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems,\ntheir effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction\ncapabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This\nwork demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities\non hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially\nextended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning\n(DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step\nrepresents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is\nthat convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability\nof improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple\nlong-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small\npositive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct\nanswers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On\nthe challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously\nunsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model\nto surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through\nmajority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER\nframework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight\nreasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification,\nrefinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for\ndeveloping next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving\ncapabilities.",

Texts generated through these\nvaried processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant\nchallenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely,\nprimarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or\nmulti-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We\nobserve that representations of texts generated through different processes\nexhibit inherent clustering relationships.

MoE boosts the efficiency by activating\na subset of experts per token. Recent works show that fine-grained experts\nsubstantially enriches the combinatorial flexibility of active experts and\nenhances model expressiveness. However, such a design is fundamentally limited\nby the layer-local routing mechanism: each layer is restricted to its own\nexpert pool. This requires a careful trade-off between expert dimensionality\nand routing diversity given fixed parameter budgets. We describe ReXMoE, a\nnovel MoE architecture that improves routing beyond the existing layer-local\napproaches by allowing routers to reuse experts across adjacent layers. ReXMoE\ndecouples expert dimensionality from per-layer budgets, enabling richer expert\ncombinations without sacrificing individual expert capacity or inflating\noverall parameters. To this end, we propose a new progressive scaling routing\n(PSR) strategy to gradually increase the candidate expert pool during training.\nAs a result, ReXMoE improves both language modeling and downstream task\nperformance.

Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL\ntasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows\nthat removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to\nbecome effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)\ngenerative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid\nscaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose\nown development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context\nfine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained\nresponse generation, natural to LLMs, combining in-context learning (ICL) from\ndemonstrations with supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably outperforms both\nICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of standard SL\ntasks. We further find that although long context hinders the performance of\ngenerative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be mitigated by\nremoving the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely unnecessary\nfor achieving strong SL performance with SIFT.

To advance research in this area, we introduce the first\nevaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both\nNative Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English\nequivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nNeural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their\nability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including\nBLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our\nfindings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation\ncompared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt\ntypes are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text\nrepresentation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu\ninputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.",

    "summary": "The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered\na plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical\nstudies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have\nbeen conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,\nthere is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental\ndesigns. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the\nuse of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we\nprovide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before\nfocusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test\ndifferent approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our\nfindings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical\nrealism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.\nWith this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based\nmodeling for social simulation.",

However, this safety is fragile.\nTwo simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search\n(Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search\n(Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across\ntwo model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks\nlower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query\nsafety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful,\nrequest-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal\ntokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards\ncontinued generation of effective queries without accounting for their\nharmfulness.

While these methods improve visual\nquality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To\nsystematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline,\nwe introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating\nsocial representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias\ntaxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to\ndisentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes\n(gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to\nevaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity,\n(3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4)\nthe temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we\nconduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference\ndatasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through\nalignment-tuned video diffusion models.

Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first\ndesign a \\textit{\\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where\nreasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once\nreading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with\n\\textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading\nthrough the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint\ntraining, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker\nemploys streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation,\nenforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and\nposition encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input\nencoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling\ntrue concurrency.

    "summary": "The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted\ndecision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs).\nAlong with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred\nincreasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning\napproaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model\nutility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated\nresponses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive\napplications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)\nframework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)\ncontext-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens\nwithout disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant\nresponse shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about\nunlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level\ninterventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning\nset to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention\nenhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in\nthe retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components\nare jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary\nthat localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under\nrepresentation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves\nperformance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods,\nachieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC\nbenchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning\neffectiveness.

To alleviate this issue, we introduce a\nnovel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding\nstrategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated\ntexts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods\nsolely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the\ncontributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination\nmitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual\ninformation. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that\ndynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining\nmaximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image\ntokens most pertinent to the generated response. Extensive experiments across\nvarious benchmarks reveal that the proposed method significantly reduces\nhallucinations in LVLMs while preserving decoding efficiency.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance\nacross vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational\noverhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number\nof multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,\n\\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse\nmultimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a\n\\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers\nrecognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;\n(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few\ncritical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely\non linguistic refinement.

    "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as social agents\nand trained to produce humor and irony, a question emerges: when encountering\nwitty AI remarks, do people interpret these as intentional communication or\nmere computational output? This study investigates whether people adopt the\nintentional stance, attributing mental states to explain behavior,toward AI\nduring irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it\nrequires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors\nthrough effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural\nresponses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established\nERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing\ncognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results\ndemonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward\nAI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to\ndeliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI\nthan human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as\ncomputational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for\nAI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis\nconsistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people\nwho perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for\nAI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated\nby specific mental models of artificial agents.

    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of\ninterest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main\napproaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or\npseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's\nparametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies\nreinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly\noptimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and\nlimitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent\nexperimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic\ncomparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse\nbenchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key\nfinding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par\nwith, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when\nusing powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid\nmethod, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of\nrewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that\nmaximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative\nstructure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE\noutperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating\nthat a synergistic approach yields the best results.

We\nobserve that motion quantization introduces approximation errors that cap\nmotion quality, and that unifying discrete text and continuous motion within a\nsingle-stream backbone amplifies cross-modal interference. Motivated by recent\nmulti-branch Transformer designs that separate signals from different\nmodalities, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal motion-language model for both\nunderstanding and generation. MotionGPT3 encodes raw motion into a continuous\nlatent space using a variational autoencoder (VAE), thereby avoiding\nquantization-induced artifacts, while leveraging the semantic prior of\npretrained language models. A dual-stream Transformer with shared attention\npreserves modality-specific routes while enabling controlled, bidirectional\ninformation flow, which reduces interference, stabilizing optimization, and\nempirically accelerates convergence without degrading fidelity. For multimodal\njoint training, a generate-then-align three-stage schedule further improves\nstability and limits cross-task interference.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first\ncomprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under\nvideo-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48\nfine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a\nharmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears\nharmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To\ngenerate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a\ncontrollable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what\nis shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of\nquery-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful\noutputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the\nconfidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration.\nExtensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average\nattack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to\nvideo-induced attacks.

Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we\nask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful\nunder normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden\ntrigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that\nembed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate\nbackdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but\nrecover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing\nsuch attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed\nand how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between\nbackdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens\nconsistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals\nthat these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing\ntriggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly\nenhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings,\nshowing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores\nforgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving\nindistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.\nCode is available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Backdoor.",

    "summary": "Toxic comment detection remains a challenging task, where transformer-based\nmodels (e.g., BERT) incur high computational costs and degrade on minority\ntoxicity classes, while classical ensembles lack semantic adaptability. We\npropose xLSTM, a parameter-efficient and theoretically grounded framework that\nunifies cosine-similarity gating, adaptive feature prioritization, and\nprincipled class rebalancing. A learnable reference vector {v} in {R}^d\nmodulates contextual embeddings via cosine similarity, amplifying toxic cues\nand attenuating benign signals to yield stronger gradients under severe class\nimbalance. xLSTM integrates multi-source embeddings (GloVe, FastText, BERT CLS)\nthrough a projection layer, a character-level BiLSTM for morphological cues,\nembedding-space SMOTE for minority augmentation, and adaptive focal loss with\ndynamic class weighting. On the Jigsaw Toxic Comment benchmark, xLSTM attains\n96.0% accuracy and 0.88 macro-F1, outperforming BERT by 33% on threat and 28%\non identity_hate categories, with 15 times fewer parameters and 50ms inference\nlatency. Cosine gating contributes a +4.8% F1 gain in ablations. The results\nestablish a new efficiency adaptability frontier, demonstrating that\nlightweight, theoretically informed architectures can surpass large pretrained\nmodels on imbalanced, domain-specific NLP tasks.",

    "summary": "Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries,\nretrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions.\nWhile researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their\nsafety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search\nagents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce\nharmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track\nsomeone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a\nsearch agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal\nthreshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize\nthem into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that\nutility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment\nof safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement\nlearning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a\nnovel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe\nones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70%\nacross three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and\nmatches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses\nconfirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety\nand utility.",

    "summary": "Iterative jailbreak methods that repeatedly rewrite and input prompts into\nlarge language models (LLMs) to induce harmful outputs -- using the model's\nprevious responses to guide each new iteration -- have been found to be a\nhighly effective attack strategy. Despite being an effective attack strategy\nagainst LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively\ndisrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel\nframework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning\nin response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the\ndistinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless\nprompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes\nprompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly\nrejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band\nof partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce\nPast-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD).

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such\nas \"walk\"->\"walked\", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard\ntokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling\nthe size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., \"walk\", \"walking\",\n\"Walk\"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We\nshow that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors --\nadditive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied\nto the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces.\nBuilding on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than\nassigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base\nform and transformation vectors (e.g., \"walked\" = \"walk\" + past tense). We\napply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to\n10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more\ndiverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage\nto out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and\nwithout modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational\nrethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a\ncompositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.",

    "summary": "Adversarial attacks by malicious users that threaten the safety of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) can be viewed as attempts to infer a target property $T$\nthat is unknown when an instruction is issued, and becomes knowable only after\nthe model's reply is observed. Examples of target properties $T$ include the\nbinary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the\ndegree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both\nelicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \\emph{observable\nsignal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response\ncontaining answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of\ninformation leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled\nguidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this\ngap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information\ncan be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods\ncome to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between\nthe observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query,\nwe show that achieving error $\\varepsilon$ requires at least\n$\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak\nrate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest\nincrease in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic\nin terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across\nsystem-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the\ntheory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding\nlogits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process\ntrims it to a few dozen. Our results provide the first principled yardstick for\nbalancing transparency and security when deploying LLMs.",

    "summary": "Existing frameworks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLM) can be\nbroadly categorized into real-world applications (e.g, document summarization)\nand synthetic tasks (e.g, needle-in-a-haystack). Despite their utility, both\napproaches are accompanied by certain intrinsic limitations. Real-world tasks\noften involve complexity that makes interpretation challenging and suffer from\ndata contamination, whereas synthetic tasks frequently lack meaningful\ncoherence between the target information (needle) and its surrounding context\n(haystack), undermining their validity as proxies for realistic applications.\nIn response to these challenges, we posit that an ideal long-context evaluation\nframework should be characterized by three essential features: 1) seamless\ncontext 2) controllable setting and 3) sound evaluation. This study introduces\n$\\textbf{LongBioBench}$, a benchmark that utilizes artificially generated\nbiographies as a controlled environment for assessing LCLMs across dimensions\nof understanding, reasoning, and trustworthiness. Our experimental evaluation,\nwhich includes 18 LCLMs in total, demonstrates that most models still exhibit\ndeficiencies in semantic understanding and elementary reasoning over retrieved\nresults and are less trustworthy as context length increases. Our further\nanalysis indicates some design choices employed by existing synthetic\nbenchmarks, such as contextual non-coherence, numerical needles, and the\nabsence of distractors, rendering them vulnerable to test the model's\nlong-context capabilities. To sum up, compared to previous synthetic\nbenchmarks, LongBioBench achieves a better trade-off between mirroring\nauthentic language tasks and maintaining controllability, and is highly\ninterpretable and configurable.",

This limitation\nbecomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual\nerrors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global\nconsistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as\ntexture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.\nRecently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant\nimprovements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for\nintegrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for\novercoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve.

    "summary": "Allocating extra computation at inference time has recently improved sample\nquality in large language models and diffusion-based image generation. In\nparallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and\nscientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain\nunder-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but\nreplace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP)\ninterpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling.\nAdditionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been\napplied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel\ninference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant\nduring sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the\nfirst time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation,\nshow that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute\nincreases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to\nscientific domains.",

Numerical experiments validate our theoretical\nfindings: our method converges at the optimal rate, has smooth trajectories,\nand is often more sample efficient than its stochastic counterpart.

It is well known that abstraction emerges\nwith depth in neural networks, where deep layers capture abstract\ncharacteristics of data by combining lower level features encoded in shallow\nlayers (e.g. edges). Yet we argue that depth alone is not enough to develop\ntruly abstract representations. We advocate that the level of abstraction\ncrucially depends on how broad the training set is. We address the issue within\na renormalisation group approach where a representation is expanded to\nencompass a broader set of data. We take the unique fixed point of this\ntransformation -- the Hierarchical Feature Model -- as a candidate for a\nrepresentation which is absolutely abstract. This theoretical picture is tested\nin numerical experiments based on Deep Belief Networks and auto-encoders\ntrained on data of different breadth.

A common challenge is the prevalence of missing not at\nrandom data, where observations are available only for certain unit-outcome\ncombinations and the observation availability can be correlated with the\nproperties of distributions themselves, i.e., there is unobserved confounding.\nAn additional challenge is that for any observed unit-outcome entry, we only\nhave a finite number of samples from the underlying distribution. We tackle\nthese two challenges by casting the problem into a novel distributional matrix\ncompletion framework and introduce a kernel based distributional generalization\nof nearest neighbors to estimate the underlying distributions. By leveraging\nmaximum mean discrepancies and a suitable factor model on the kernel mean\nembeddings of the underlying distributions, we establish consistent recovery of\nthe underlying distributions even when data is missing not at random and\npositivity constraints are violated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our\nnearest neighbors approach is robust to heteroscedastic noise, provided we have\naccess to two or more measurements for the observed unit-outcome entries, a\nrobustness not present in prior works on nearest neighbors with single\nmeasurements.",

    "summary": "As data-driven and AI-based decision making gains widespread adoption across\ndisciplines, it is crucial that both data privacy and decision fairness are\nappropriately addressed. Although differential privacy (DP) provides a robust\nframework for guaranteeing privacy and methods are available to improve\nfairness, most prior work treats the two concerns separately. Even though there\nare existing approaches that consider privacy and fairness simultaneously, they\ntypically focus on a single specific learning task, limiting their\ngeneralizability. In response, we introduce SAFES, a Sequential PrivAcy and\nFairness Enhancing data Synthesis procedure that sequentially combines DP data\nsynthesis with a fairness-aware data preprocessing step. SAFES allows users\nflexibility in navigating the privacy-fairness-utility trade-offs. We\nillustrate SAFES with different DP synthesizers and fairness-aware data\npreprocessing methods and run extensive experiments on multiple real datasets\nto examine the privacy-fairness-utility trade-offs of synthetic data generated\nby SAFES. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that for reasonable privacy loss,\nSAFES-generated synthetic data can achieve significantly improved fairness\nmetrics with relatively low utility loss.",

    "summary": "In many scientific and engineering (e.g., physical, biochemical, medical)\npractices, data generated through expensive experiments or large-scale\nsimulations, are often sparse and noisy. Physics-informed neural network (PINN)\nincorporates physical information and knowledge into network topology or\ncomputational processes as model priors, with the unique advantage of achieving\nstrong generalization with small data. This study aims to investigate the\nperformance characteristics of the soft-constrained PINN method to solving\ntypical linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) such as\nprimer, Van der Pol and Duffing oscillators, especially the effectiveness,\nefficiency, and robustness to noise with minimal data. It is verified that the\nsoft-constrained PINN significantly reduces the need for labeled data. With the\naid of appropriate collocation points no need to be labeled, it can predict and\nalso extrapolate with minimal data. First-order and second-order ODEs, no\nmatter linear or nonlinear oscillators, require only one and two training data\n(containing initial values) respectively, just like classical analytic or\nRunge-Kutta methods, and with equivalent precision and comparable efficiency\n(fast training in seconds for scalar ODEs). Furthermore, it can conveniently\nimpose a physical law (e.g., conservation of energy) constraint by adding a\nregularization term to the total loss function, improving the performance to\ndeal with various complexities such as nonlinearity like Duffing. The\nDeepXDE-based PINN implementation is light code and can be efficiently trained\non both GPU and CPU platforms. The mathematical and computational framework of\nthis alternative and feasible PINN method to ODEs, can be easily extended to\nPDEs, etc., and is becoming a favorable catalyst for the era of Digital Twins.",

    "summary": "Sequential decision-making algorithms such as multi-armed bandits can find\noptimal personalized decisions, but are notoriously sample-hungry. In\npersonalized medicine, for example, training a bandit from scratch for every\npatient is typically infeasible, as the number of trials required is much\nlarger than the number of decision points for a single patient. To combat this,\nlatent bandits offer rapid exploration and personalization beyond what context\nvariables alone can offer, provided that a latent variable model of problem\ninstances can be learned consistently. However, existing works give no guidance\nas to how such a model can be found. In this work, we propose an identifiable\nlatent bandit framework that leads to optimal decision-making with a shorter\nexploration time than classical bandits by learning from historical records of\ndecisions and outcomes. Our method is based on nonlinear independent component\nanalysis that provably identifies representations from observational data\nsufficient to infer optimal actions in new bandit instances.

However, most\nconvergence guarantees rely on restrictive regularity assumptions on the target\ndistribution -- such as strong log-concavity or bounded support. This work\nestablishes non-asymptotic convergence bounds in the 2-Wasserstein distance for\na general class of probability flow ODEs under considerably weaker assumptions:\nweak log-concavity and Lipschitz continuity of the score function. Our\nframework accommodates non-log-concave distributions, such as Gaussian\nmixtures, and explicitly accounts for initialization errors, score\napproximation errors, and effects of discretization via an exponential\nintegrator scheme. Bridging a key theoretical challenge in diffusion-based\ngenerative modeling, our results extend convergence theory to more realistic\ndata distributions and practical ODE solvers. We provide concrete guarantees\nfor the efficiency and correctness of the sampling algorithm, complementing the\nempirical success of diffusion models with rigorous theory.

An automated feature engineering pipeline\nextracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent\nmodel input across all configurations.

This discrepancy highlights a core\nchallenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely,\nthe mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our\nanalysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to\nshort-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue\nis compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of\nquantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints.

It has since been implemented in additional\nPython frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, as well as in other\nprogramming languages such as Julia. Despite its practical success, the einsum\nnotation still lacks a solid theoretical basis, and is not unified across the\ndifferent frameworks, limiting opportunities for formal reasoning and\nsystematic optimization. In this work, we discuss the terminology of tensor\nexpressions and provide a formal definition of the einsum language. Based on\nthis definition, we formalize and prove important equivalence rules for tensor\nexpressions and highlight their relevance in practical applications.",

    "summary": "The capacity of deep learning models is often large enough to both learn the\nunderlying statistical signal and overfit to noise in the training set. This\nnoise memorization can be harmful especially for data with a low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to poor generalization. Inspired by prior\nobservations that label noise provides implicit regularization that improves\ngeneralization, in this work, we investigate whether introducing label noise to\nthe gradient updates can enhance the test performance of neural network (NN) in\nthe low SNR regime. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer NN with a\nsimple label noise gradient descent (GD) algorithm, in an idealized\nsignal-noise data setting. We prove that adding label noise during training\nsuppresses noise memorization, preventing it from dominating the learning\nprocess; consequently, label noise GD enjoys rapid signal growth while the\noverfitting remains controlled, thereby achieving good generalization despite\nthe low SNR. In contrast, we also show that NN trained with standard GD tends\nto overfit to noise in the same low SNR setting and establish a non-vanishing\nlower bound on its test error, thus demonstrating the benefit of introducing\nlabel noise in gradient-based training.",

Group distributional robustness methods,\nsuch as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to\nupweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels\nare often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the\nsubgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple\nspurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups.

While prior efforts have\ndeveloped detection mechanisms for functionally-driven temporary anomalies such\nas drowsiness and distraction, limited research has addressed\npathologically-triggered deviations, especially those stemming from chronic\nmedical conditions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the driving behavior of\nParkinson's disease patients and propose SAFE-D, a novel framework for\ndetecting Parkinson-related behavioral anomalies to enhance driving safety. Our\nmethodology starts by performing analysis of Parkinson's disease\nsymptomatology, focusing on primary motor impairments, and establishes causal\nlinks to degraded driving performance. To represent the subclinical behavioral\nvariations of early-stage Parkinson's disease, our framework integrates data\nfrom multiple vehicle control components to build a behavioral profile. We then\ndesign an attention-based network that adaptively prioritizes spatiotemporal\nfeatures, enabling robust anomaly detection under physiological variability.\nFinally, we validate SAFE-D on the Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator,\nusing data from three road maps to emulate real-world driving.

    "summary": "Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for\ngradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable\", regime.\nIn contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a\nlarge step size regime called the ``edge of stability\", in which the objective\ndecreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima.\nIn this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing\nconvergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an\noverparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is\nthat, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers\nforms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD\ndynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component\ncorresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while\nthe orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows\nus to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning\nrate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is\novercome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global\nminimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time\nwith a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c)\nthe supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with\nlinear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat\nglobal minimum.",

Embedding geological knowledge directly\ninto predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables\njust that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train\ngenerative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores\nwhether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning\nalgorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be\ninverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to\nthree test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,\nespecially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the\ntraining data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it\nis entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not\nnecessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent\noverparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during\ntraining, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning\nthe GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to\nacceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this\napproach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which\ninfluences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can\nalready handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling\nworkflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best\nleverage them in support of geological interpretation.",

A\nDirac-like memory trace corresponds to a nontrivial homology generator,\nrepresenting a sparse, irreducible attractor that reactivates only when\ninference trajectories close upon themselves. In this view, memory is not a\nstatic attractor landscape but a topological process of recurrence, where\nstructure arises through the stabilization of closed loops. Building on this\nprinciple, we represent spike-timing dynamics as spatiotemporal complexes, in\nwhich temporally consistent transitions among neurons form chain complexes\nsupporting persistent activation cycles. These cycles are organized into cell\nposets, compact causal representations that encode overlapping and\ncompositional memory traces. Within this construction, learning and recall\ncorrespond to cycle closure under contextual modulation: inference trajectories\nstabilize into nontrivial homology classes when both local synchrony (context)\nand global recurrence (content) are satisfied. We formalize this mechanism\nthrough the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), which states that\ncognition minimizes joint uncertainty between a high-entropy context variable\nand a low-entropy content variable.

    "summary": "Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy cyberattacks that often evade\ndetection in system-level audit logs. Provenance graphs model these logs as\nconnected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by\nlinear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these\ngraphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained\nalerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to\nspurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully\nunderstand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems\nthat can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and\nreconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes\nrather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads\nto a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs\nusing Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories.\nEach stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring\nan interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and\nNODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both\ndetection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs\nhuman-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.",

Moreover, our FM-MCMC method also attained the highest average\nlog-likelihood among all approaches, demonstrating its superior sampling\nefficiency and accuracy. This highlights the scalability and efficiency of our\napproach, making it well-suited for processing the massive datasets expected\nfrom future exoplanet surveys.

    "summary": "Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) is the building block of graph\nfoundation models, but fundamentally suffer from oversmoothing and\noversquashing. There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both\nissues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be\nbeneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the\nsuboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing\nthrough a global measure -- spectral gap $\\lambda$ -- and prove that the\nincrease of $\\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input\nfeatures, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated\nby such theoretical insights, we propose a \\textbf{local} approach that\nadaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this,\nwe connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel\nnonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and\noversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with\nlocal bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive\nexperiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of\nGBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the\nnetwork depth exceeds $256$ layers.",

Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data\ndemonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute\nError (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%,\nwith a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width.

However, training of multimodal networks is typically\nhindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one\nof the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,\nhindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal\nimprovements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the\nModality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint\nfusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in\nmodality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively\nbalance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during\ntraining to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal\nmodel, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal\npredictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion\ntasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our\nresults show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion\nmethods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during\ntraining.

However, beyond mere\ndetection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the\ntype of OOD data encountered.

This work argues that\nscalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly\ncontextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the\nintroduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC\nleverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a\nrich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies\nacross multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular\nbenchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for\nOOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely\nabsent from prior work.

    "title": "Model Metamers Reveal Invariances in Graph Neural Networks",
    "summary": "In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in\nperceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to\nemulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies\nin the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain\nbetween the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of\nhumans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks\n(GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing\ninput graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a\nreference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's\nrepresentation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node\nfeatures. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer\ndimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the\nmetamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of\nrepresentational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although\ntargeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can\npartially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge\nthe gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between\nmetamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes\nof current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.",

    "title": "Going with the Flow: Approximating Banzhaf Values via Graph Neural\n  Networks",
    "summary": "Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for\nquantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging\nfrom cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is\nintractable for systems with more than $\\sim20$ agents due to exponential\ncomplexity $\\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide\nstatistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot\ntransfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them\nimpractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel\nlearning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate\nBanzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a\ngraph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent\ninfluence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a\ncomprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN\narchitectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with\nEdge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of\n200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count\n(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained\nGNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with\norder-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most\nsignificantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on\ngraphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for\nentirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring\nretraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable\ncooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.",

We refer to such neural operators as Neural Green's Operators (NGOs).\nOur construction of NGOs preserves the linear action of Green's operators on\nthe inhomogeneity fields, while approximating the nonlinear dependence of the\nGreen's function on the coefficients of the PDE using neural networks that take\nweighted averages of such coefficients as input. This construction reduces the\ncomplexity of the problem from learning the entire solution operator and its\ndependence on all parameters to only learning the Green's function and its\ndependence on the PDE coefficients. Moreover, taking weighted averages, rather\nthan point samples, of input functions decouples the network size from the\nnumber of sampling points, enabling efficient resolution of multiple scales in\nthe input fields. Furthermore, we show that our explicit representation of\nGreen's functions enables the embedding of desirable mathematical attributes in\nour NGO architectures, such as symmetry, spectral, and conservation properties.\nThrough numerical benchmarks on canonical PDEs, we demonstrate that NGOs\nachieve comparable or superior accuracy to deep operator networks,\nvariationally mimetic operator networks, and Fourier neural operators with\nsimilar parameter counts, while generalizing significantly better when tested\non out-of-distribution data. For time-dependent PDEs, we show that NGOs can\nproduce pointwise-accurate dynamics in an auto-regressive manner when trained\non a single time step.

However, conformal\nprediction only works if we fix the underlying machine learning model in\nadvance. A relatively unaddressed issue in conformal prediction is that of\nmodel selection and/or aggregation: given a set of prediction models, which one\nshould we conformalize? This paper suggests that instead of performing model\nselection, it can be prudent and practical to perform conformal set aggregation\nin an online, adaptive fashion. We propose a wrapper that takes in several\nconformal prediction sets (themselves wrapped around black-box prediction\nmodels), and outputs a single adaptively-combined prediction set. Our method,\ncalled conformal online model aggregation (COMA), is based on combining the\nprediction sets from several algorithms by weighted voting, and can be thought\nof as a sort of online stacking of the underlying conformal sets. As long as\nthe input sets have (distribution-free) coverage guarantees, COMA retains\ncoverage guarantees, under a negative correlation assumption between errors and\nweights. We verify that the assumption holds empirically in all settings\nconsidered. COMA is well-suited for decentralized or distributed settings,\nwhere different users may have different models, and are only willing to share\ntheir prediction sets for a new test point in a black-box fashion.

However, available satellite products, such as\nCopernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and\nglobal ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed\nlocal analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning\nframework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary\nresolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to\nCopernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate\nPDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input\nresolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data\nand synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.",

This study proposes a deep learning\nneural network architecture, an attention-based encoder (AttEnc), which uses an\nattention mechanism for driver identification and uses fewer model parameters\nthan current methods.

The experiments showed that the attention-based encoder can\nidentify drivers with accuracies of 99.3%, 99.0% and 99.9% in three different\ndatasets and has a prediction time that is 44% to 79% faster because it\nsignificantly reduces, on average, 87.6% of the model parameters.

    "summary": "In recent years, tensor decomposition-based approaches for hyperspectral\nanomaly detection (HAD) have gained significant attention in the field of\nremote sensing. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the\nglobal correlations and local smoothness of the background components in\nhyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial\ndomains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To\nmitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named\nHAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR)\nfactors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first\ndecomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then\nemployed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background\ncomponent. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex\nregularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to\nsimultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR\nfactors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables\nthe interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and\nsmoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we\ndesign a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group\nsparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex\nmodel, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental\nresults on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of detection\naccuracy.",

Existing methods typically design\nseparate frameworks for either domain adaptation or domain generalization,\noften relying on extensive labeled data. Existing methods that designed for\ndomain generalization is often relying on extensive labeled data. However,\nreal-world scenarios are far more complex, where the deployed model must be\ncapable of handling generalization under limited labeled source data. To this\nend, we propose UniCrossFi, a unified framework designed to mitigate\nperformance drop in CSI-based sensing across diverse deployment settings. Our\nframework not only extends conventional Domain Generalization (DG) to a more\npractical Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) setting, where only\npartially labeled source data are available, but also introduces a\nphysics-informed data augmentation strategy, Antenna Response Consistency\n(ARC). ARC mitigates the risk of learning superficial shortcuts by exploiting\nthe intrinsic spatial diversity of multi-antenna systems, treating signals from\ndifferent antennas as naturally augmented views of the same event. In addition,\nwe design a Unified Contrastive Objective to prevent conventional contrastive\nlearning from pushing apart samples from different domains that share the same\nclass. We conduct extensive experiments on the public Widar and CSIDA datasets.\nThe results demonstrate that UniCrossFi consistently establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods across all\nunsupervised domain adaptation, DG, and SSDG benchmarks.

Objective comparison between simulation approaches is\noften hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of\nrare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that\nsystematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.\nOur approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble\nSimulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on\nprogress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis\n(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational\nspace. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that\nsupports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and\nmachine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a\ncomprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different\nmetrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a\ndataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a\nvariety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been\nextensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4\nns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests\nusing classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein\nconformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet\nmodel.

    "summary": "Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of\nPatching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to\neffectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space\nbeneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching\npartitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed\nrepresentation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful\nrepresentations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a\nselective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches\nfor forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space\n(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic\nReassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the\ncontextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of\ncontextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based\nmodels. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet\neffective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.\nFurthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the\nperformance of existing patch-based models.

Current\nevaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct\neffects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and\nattack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and\ncomprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework\nevaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten\ndatasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and\nhybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive\nanalysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly\nnoteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and\nstructure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text\nencoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to\ntraining data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce\nSFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness\nagainst both textual and structural attacks within a single model.

Many former studies have introduced defensive\napproaches to preclude Quishing such as by classifying the embedded content of\nQR codes and then label the QR codes accordingly, whereas other studies\nclassify them using visual features (i.e., deep features, histogram density\nanalysis features). However, these approaches mainly rely on black-box\ntechniques which do not clearly provide interpretability and transparency to\nfully comprehend and reproduce the intrinsic decision process; therefore,\nhaving certain obvious limitations includes the approaches' trust,\naccountability, issues in bias detection, and many more. We proposed QR\\\"iS,\nthe pioneer method to classify QR codes through the comprehensive structural\nanalysis of a QR code which helps to identify phishing QR codes beforehand. Our\nclassification method is clearly transparent which makes it reproducible,\nscalable, and easy to comprehend.

Then, unlike\nblack-box models, we developed a simple algorithm to extract 24 structural\nfeatures from layout patterns present in QR codes.

To further evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform the\ncomparative analysis of proposed method with relevant contemporary studies.\nLastly, for real-world deployment and validation, we developed a mobile app\nwhich assures the feasibility of the proposed solution in real-world scenarios\nwhich eventually strengthen the applicability of the study.",

In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms\nbuild on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to\nadapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,\nresource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise\nor inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a\nlightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously\nadjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a\nclosed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,\nprivacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),\nlocal privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on\nenvironmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances\nprivacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to\nadaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a\ndynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative\nrisk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead\ndeployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations\ndemonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while\npreserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge\napplications.",

This is\ninappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples\nfrom unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be\nable to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after\nthey are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised\nlearning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and\nincrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the\npast data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered\nclasses, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two\nchallenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes\noften appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and\nincremental learning of new classes on the fly.

Given a hypergraph, hyperedge prediction\naims to identify hyperedges that are either missing or likely to form in the\nfuture, and it has broad applications, including recommending interest-based\nsocial groups, predicting collaborations, and uncovering functional complexes\nin biological systems. However, the vast search space of hyperedge candidates\n(i.e., all possible subsets of nodes) poses a significant computational\nchallenge, making naive exhaustive search infeasible. As a result, existing\napproaches rely on either heuristic sampling to obtain constrained candidate\nsets or ungrounded assumptions on hypergraph structure to select promising\nhyperedges.\n  In this work, we propose HyperSearch, a search-based algorithm for hyperedge\nprediction that efficiently evaluates unconstrained candidate sets, by\nincorporating two key components: (1) an empirically grounded scoring function\nderived from observations in real-world hypergraphs and (2) an efficient search\nmechanism, where we derive and use an anti-monotonic upper bound of the\noriginal scoring function (which is not antimonotonic) to prune the search\nspace.

This success is mainly credited to a\nmemorization effect: models tend to perform better on a member than a\nnon-member. However, we find that standard MIAs fail against distilled\ngenerative models (i.e., student models) that are increasingly deployed in\npractice for efficiency (e.g., ChatGPT 4o-mini). Trained exclusively on data\ngenerated from a large-scale model (a teacher model), the student model lacks\ndirect exposure to any members (teacher's training data), nullifying the\nmemorization effect that standard MIAs rely on. This finding reveals a serious\nprivacy loophole, where generation-service providers could deploy a student\nmodel whose teacher was potentially trained on unauthorized data, yet claim the\ndeployed model is clean because it was not directly trained on such data.\nHence, are distilled models inherently unauditable for upstream privacy\nviolations, and should we discard them when we care about privacy? We contend\nno, as we uncover a memory chain connecting the student and teacher's member\ndata: the distribution of student-generated data aligns more closely with the\ndistribution of the teacher's members than with non-members, thus we can detect\nunauthorized data usage even when direct instance-level memorization is absent.\nThis leads us to posit that MIAs on distilled generative models should shift\nfrom instance-level scores to distribution-level statistics. We further propose\nthree principles of distribution-based MIAs for detecting unauthorized training\ndata through distilled generative models, and validate our position through an\nexemplar framework.

    "title": "Neural Network Reprogrammability: A Unified Theme on Model\n  Reprogramming, Prompt Tuning, and Prompt Instruction",
    "summary": "As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and\ncapability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become\nincreasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation\napproaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of\ntheir interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network\nreprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model\nadaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt\ninstruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared\nprinciple: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the\ninterfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit\nneural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it\nthrough perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or\nproviding task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors\ntowards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such\ninformation manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key\ndimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces\nwhere manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output\nalignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream\ntasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,\nindependent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established\ntechniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this\nlens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We\nfurther analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,\npositioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for\nefficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions\nemerging from this integrative viewpoint.",

The popular classifier-free\nguidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced\nvariation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has\nsuccessfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately\ntrained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the\nconsiderable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model.

    "summary": "Enabling large language models (LLMs) to unlearn knowledge and capabilities\nacquired during training has proven vital for ensuring compliance with data\nregulations and promoting ethical practices in generative AI. Although there\nare growing interests in developing various unlearning algorithms, it remains\nunclear how to best formulate the unlearning problem. The most popular\nformulation uses a weighted sum of forget and retain loss, but it often leads\nto performance degradation due to the inherent trade-off between forget and\nretain losses. In this work, we argue that it is important to model the\nhierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem\n(which \\textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority\nover the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical\nstructure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the\nlower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the\nupper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new\nformulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning\n(\\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but\nmore importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that \\texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and\nmetrics.

However, this assumption often does not hold in\nLLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a\nshift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.\n  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions\ncontribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm\nperformance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware\nactivation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their\nimpact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that\nconsiders both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a\nclosed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the\neigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix.

In each round, the learner selects a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a\nset $X \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\\boldsymbol{y}_t \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\\langle \\boldsymbol{x}_t, \\boldsymbol{y}_t\n\\rangle \\in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,\nincluding extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask\nlearning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is\nwell known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log |X|}\\big)$ after\n$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal\nacross all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X\n\\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\\sqrt{\\log\nd}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\\Omega\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log(|X|)/\\log\nd}\\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of\ncombinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\\log d \\leq m \\leq \\sqrt{d}$--for\nwhich this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by\na factor of exactly $\\sqrt{\\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is\noptimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical\n$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to\nestablish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path\nproblems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial\ndomains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)\nalgorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is\niterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret\nguarantees for DAGs.",

For\nexample, whether regret matching converges to Nash equilibria in potential\ngames has been an open problem for two decades.

    "title": "Mode Collapse of Mean-Field Variational Inference",
    "summary": "Mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is a widely used method for\napproximating high-dimensional probability distributions by product measures.\nIt has been empirically observed that MFVI optimizers often suffer from mode\ncollapse. Specifically, when the target measure $\\pi$ is a mixture $\\pi = w P_0\n+ (1 - w) P_1$, the MFVI optimizer tends to place most of its mass near a\nsingle component of the mixture. This work provides the first theoretical\nexplanation of mode collapse in MFVI. We introduce the notion to capture the\nseparatedness of the two mixture components -- called\n$\\varepsilon$-separateness -- and derive explicit bounds on the fraction of\nmass that any MFVI optimizer assigns to each component when $P_0$ and $P_1$ are\n$\\varepsilon$-separated for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$. Our results\nsuggest that the occurrence of mode collapse crucially depends on the relative\nposition of the components. To address this issue, we propose the rotational\nvariational inference (RoVI), which augments MFVI with a rotation matrix. The\nnumerical studies support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the benefits\nof RoVI.",

    "title": "Consistent Zero-Shot Imitation with Contrastive Goal Inference",
    "summary": "In the same way that generative models today conduct most of their training\nin a self-supervised fashion, how can agentic models conduct their training in\na self-supervised fashion, interactively exploring, learning, and preparing to\nquickly adapt to new tasks? A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real\nworld interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most\nsuccessful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion\nof action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is\nwell studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with\na wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation\nto new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided\nby humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that\nthe model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a\nsonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to\nsolve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of\ntheir time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a\nmethod for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so\nthat they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals\n(i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method\nautomatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior\nwork in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method\nsolves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain\ndemonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard\nbenchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms\nprior methods for zero-shot imitation.",

    "summary": "The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has powered major advances in domains\nsuch as natural language processing and computer vision, with representative\nexamples including masked language modeling and next-token prediction. In\nmolecular representation learning, however, pretraining tasks remain largely\nrestricted to node-level denoising, which effectively captures local atomic\nenvironments but is often insufficient for encoding the global molecular\nstructure critical to graph-level property prediction tasks such as energy\nestimation and molecular regression. To address this gap, we introduce\nGeoRecon, a graph-level pretraining framework that shifts the focus from\nindividual atoms to the molecule as an integrated whole. GeoRecon formulates a\ngraph-level reconstruction task: during pretraining, the model is trained to\nproduce an informative graph representation that guides geometry reconstruction\nwhile inducing smoother and more transferable latent spaces. This encourages\nthe learning of coherent, global structural features beyond isolated atomic\ndetails. Without relying on external supervision, GeoRecon generally improves\nover backbone baselines on multiple molecular benchmarks including QM9, MD17,\nMD22, and 3BPA, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-level reconstruction\nfor holistic and geometry-aware molecular embeddings.",

    "summary": "Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a\ncritical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.\nConventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /\nLWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,\nparticularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate\nillumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging\nhas emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric\ndisturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the\nadvancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face\nsignificant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR\ndatasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to\nsynthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming\nspectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast\nenhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework\nintegrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized\nencoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and\na softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public RGB-LWIR\nbenchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real\nRGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion\nframework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural\nfidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal\nbaselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of\nU2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight\nsubstantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and\nautonomous systems.",

    "summary": "Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems\nhas attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient\nsolutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically\ntrained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially\nlimits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus\nhampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a\ncontinual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with\ninstances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design\nan inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from\nsmaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other\nhand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model\nby imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.\nAdditionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly\ntrained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results\nshow that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across\nvarious problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to\nstate-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for\ngeneralizability enhancement.

    "summary": "Given an intractable distribution $p$, the problem of variational inference\n(VI) is to find the best approximation from some more tractable family $Q$.\nCommonly, one chooses $Q$ to be a family of factorized distributions (i.e., the\nmean-field assumption), even though $p$ itself does not factorize. We show that\nthis mismatch can lead to an impossibility theorem: if $p$ does not factorize\nand furthermore has a non-diagonal covariance matrix, then any factorized\napproximation $q\\!\\in\\!Q$ can correctly estimate at most one of the following\nthree measures of uncertainty: (i) the marginal variances, (ii) the marginal\nprecisions, or (iii) the generalized variance (which for elliptical\ndistributions is closely related to the entropy). In practice, the best\nvariational approximation in $Q$ is found by minimizing some divergence\n$D(q,p)$ between distributions, and so we ask: how does the choice of\ndivergence determine which measure of uncertainty, if any, is correctly\nestimated by VI? We consider the classic Kullback-Leibler divergences, the more\ngeneral $\\alpha$-divergences, and a score-based divergence which compares\n$\\nabla \\log p$ and $\\nabla \\log q$. We thoroughly analyze the case where $p$\nis a Gaussian and $q$ is a (factorized) Gaussian.

    "summary": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) represent an entirely new\nclass of generative AI methods that have yet to be fully explored. They use\nLangevin dynamics, represented as stochastic differential equations, to\ndescribe a process that transforms data into noise, the forward process, and a\nprocess that transforms noise into generated data, the reverse process. Many of\nthese methods utilize auxiliary variables that formulate the data as a\n``position\" variable, and the auxiliary variables are referred to as\n``velocity\", ``acceleration\", etc. In this sense, it is possible to\n``critically damp\" the dynamics. Critical damping has been successfully\nintroduced in Critically-Damped Langevin Dynamics (CLD) and Critically-Damped\nThird-Order Langevin Dynamics (TOLD++), but has not yet been applied to\ndynamics of arbitrary order. The proposed methodology generalizes Higher-Order\nLangevin Dynamics (HOLD), a recent state-of-the-art diffusion method, by\nintroducing the concept of critical damping from systems analysis. Similarly to\nTOLD++, this work proposes an optimal set of hyperparameters in the\n$n$-dimensional case, where HOLD leaves these to be user defined. Additionally,\nthis work provides closed-form solutions for the mean and covariance of the\nforward process that greatly simplify its implementation.

Extensive experiments on four\nweb-related heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrate that HERO substantially\nmitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient and consistent\nknowledge reuse in dynamic web environments.",

    "title": "Graph4MM: Weaving Multimodal Learning with Structural Information",
    "summary": "Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships\nbeyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities\nacross modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming\ndiverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.\nGraphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and\ninter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish\nmulti-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which\nfragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key\nchallenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from\nmulti-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific\ninformation in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the\nrole of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and\npropose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,\nwe introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural\ninformation into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.\nFurthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for\ncross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that\nleveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions\nimproves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone\nmodality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that\nGraph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,\nachieving a 6.93% average improvement.",

The rule is based on an\nestimate of the transfer gain i.e. the marginal reduction in the predictive\nerror.

    "summary": "Gradient orthogonalization is a simple strategy that shows great utility in\nspeeding up gradient descent. The Muon optimizer (Jordan, Jin, et al., 2024)\ncombines gradient orthogonalization with first-order momentum and achieves\nsignificant improvement in data efficiency over Adam/AdamW (Loshchilov and\nHutter, 2019) for language model training. However, when using model\nparallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared\nto coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and\nscatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This\nadditional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to\nAdam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic\nOrthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to\nmatrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization\nto maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning\nrate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this\nalgorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for\nthe blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization\nsteps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and\nachieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while\nproviding per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such\nas AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO\noptimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to\nMuon with no degradation in performance.",

    "summary": "Many researchers have applied classical statistical decision theory to\nevaluate treatment choices and learn optimal policies. However, because this\nframework is based solely on realized outcomes under chosen decisions and\nignores counterfactual outcomes, it cannot assess the quality of a decision\nrelative to feasible alternatives. For example, in bail decisions, a judge must\nconsider not only crime prevention but also the avoidance of unnecessary\nburdens on arrestees. To address this limitation, we generalize standard\ndecision theory by incorporating counterfactual losses, allowing decisions to\nbe evaluated using all potential outcomes. The central challenge in this\ncounterfactual statistical decision framework is identification: since only one\npotential outcome is observed for each unit, the associated counterfactual risk\nis generally not identifiable. We prove that, under the assumption of strong\nignorability, the counterfactual risk is identifiable if and only if the\ncounterfactual loss function is additive in the potential outcomes. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that additive counterfactual losses can yield treatment\nrecommendations, which differ from those based on standard loss functions when\nthe decision problem involves more than two treatment options. One\ninterpretation of this result is that additive counterfactual losses can\ncapture the accuracy and difficulty of a decision, whereas standard losses\naccount for accuracy alone. Finally, we formulate a symbolic linear inverse\nprogram that, given a counterfactual loss, determines whether its risk is\nidentifiable, without requiring data.",

However, existing methods almost exclusively rely on a\ntemplate adult body shape to model the training data, which poses challenges\nwhen generalizing to individuals with largely different body shapes (such as a\nchild).

To fill this gap, we propose Shape-aware\nInertial Poser (SAIP), the first solution considering body shape differences in\nsparse inertial-based motion capture. Specifically, we decompose the sensor\nmeasurements related to shape and pose in order to effectively model their\njoint correlations. Firstly, we train a regression model to transfer the\nIMU-measured accelerations of a real body to match the template adult body\nmodel, compensating for the shape-related sensor measurements. Then, we can\neasily follow the state-of-the-art methods to estimate the full body motions of\nthe template-shaped body. Finally, we utilize a second regression model to map\nthe joint velocities back to the real body, combined with a shape-aware\nphysical optimization strategy to calculate global motions on the subject.\nFurthermore, our method relies on body shape awareness, introducing the first\ninertial shape estimation scheme. This is accomplished by modeling the\nshape-conditioned IMU-pose correlation using an MLP-based network. To validate\nthe effectiveness of SAIP, we also present the first IMU motion capture dataset\ncontaining individuals of different body sizes. This dataset features 10\nchildren and 10 adults, with heights ranging from 110 cm to 190 cm, and a total\nof 400 minutes of paired IMU-Motion samples. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that SAIP can effectively handle motion capture tasks for diverse\nbody shapes. The code and dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/yinlu5942/SAIP.",

    "summary": "Building robots that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic, unstructured\nenvironments remains a core challenge. Recent embodied systems often adopt a\ndual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System\n1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the\nembodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and\ndecision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation\nof the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution\nsuccess, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete\ndimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of\ncognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark\nthat systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as\nembodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation\npipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension,\nperception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure\nanalysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure\nrealism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects,\nand multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For\nplanning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework,\nMLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether\npredicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14\nMLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction\ncomprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained\naffordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a\ncomprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the\ndevelopment of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in\nhttps://robo-bench.github.io.",

However, the\nheuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the\ntime-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the\napplication of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal\ntrajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based\non the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential\nDynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The\nintroduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP\n(PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local\nconstraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all\nUAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed\nParameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on\nthe spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce\nthe number of algorithmic iterations.

    "summary": "Muscle force sharing is typically resolved by minimizing a specific objective\nfunction to approximate neural control strategies. An inverse optimal control\napproach was applied to identify the \"best\" objective function, among a\npositive linear combination of basis objective functions, associated with the\ngait of two post-stroke males, one high-functioning (subject S1) and one\nlow-functioning (subject S2). It was found that the \"best\" objective function\nis subject- and leg-specific. No single function works universally well, yet\nthe best options are usually differently weighted combinations of muscle\nactivation- and power-minimization. Subject-specific inverse optimal control\nmodels performed best on their respective limbs (\\textbf{RMSE 178/213 N, CC\n0.71/0.61} for non-paretic and paretic legs of S1; \\textbf{RMSE 205/165 N, CC\n0.88/0.85} for respective legs of S2), but cross-subject generalization was\npoor, particularly for paretic legs. Moreover, minimizing the root mean square\nof muscle power emerged as important for paretic limbs, while minimizing\nactivation-based functions dominated for non-paretic limbs. This may suggest\ndifferent neural control strategies between affected and unaffected sides,\npossibly altered by the presence of spasticity. Among the 15 considered\nobjective functions commonly used in inverse dynamics-based computations, the\nroot mean square of muscle power was the only one explicitly incorporating\nmuscle velocity, leading to a possible model for spasticity in the paretic\nlimbs.

    "summary": "Grey-box methods for system identification combine deep learning with\nphysics-informed constraints, capturing complex dependencies while improving\nout-of-distribution generalization. Yet, despite the growing importance of\nfloating-base systems such as humanoids and quadrupeds, current grey-box models\nignore their specific physical constraints. For instance, the inertia matrix is\nnot only positive definite but also exhibits branch-induced sparsity and input\nindependence. Moreover, the 6x6 composite spatial inertia of the floating base\ninherits properties of single-rigid-body inertia matrices. As we show, this\nincludes the triangle inequality on the eigenvalues of the composite rotational\ninertia. To address the lack of physical consistency in deep learning models of\nfloating-base systems, we introduce a parameterization of inertia matrices that\nsatisfies all these constraints. Inspired by Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN),\nwe train neural networks to predict physically plausible inertia matrices that\nminimize inverse dynamics error under Lagrangian mechanics. For evaluation, we\ncollected and released a dataset on multiple quadrupeds and humanoids. In these\nexperiments, our Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks (FeLaN) achieve highly\ncompetitive performance on both simulated and real robots, while providing\ngreater physical interpretability.",

    "summary": "Planetary exploration missions require robots capable of navigating extreme\nand unknown environments. While wheeled rovers have dominated past missions,\ntheir mobility is limited to traversable surfaces. Legged robots, especially\nquadrupeds, can overcome these limitations by handling uneven, obstacle-rich,\nand deformable terrains. However, deploying such robots in unknown conditions\nis challenging due to the need for environment-specific control, which is\ninfeasible when terrain and robot parameters are uncertain.

    "summary": "Long-term autonomy for mobile robots requires both robust self-localization\nand reliable map maintenance. Conventional landmark-based methods face a\nfundamental trade-off between landmarks with high detectability but low\ndistinctiveness (e.g., poles) and those with high distinctiveness but difficult\nstable detection (e.g., local point cloud structures). This work addresses the\nchallenge of descriptively identifying a unique \"signature\" (local point cloud)\nby leveraging a detectable, high-precision \"anchor\" (like a pole). To solve\nthis, we propose a novel canonical representation, \"Pole-Image,\" as a hybrid\nmethod that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding\n3D structure. Pole-Image represents a pole-like landmark and its surrounding\nenvironment, detected from a LiDAR point cloud, as a 2D polar coordinate image\nwith the pole itself as the origin. This representation leverages the pole's\nnature as a high-precision reference point, explicitly encoding the \"relative\ngeometry\" between the stable pole and the variable surrounding point cloud. The\nkey advantage of pole landmarks is that \"detection\" is extremely easy. This\nease of detection allows the robot to easily track the same pole, enabling the\nautomatic and large-scale collection of diverse observational data (positive\npairs). This data acquisition feasibility makes \"Contrastive Learning (CL)\"\napplicable. By applying CL, the model learns a viewpoint-invariant and highly\ndiscriminative descriptor. The contributions are twofold: 1) The descriptor\novercomes perceptual aliasing, enabling robust self-localization. 2) The\nhigh-precision encoding enables high-sensitivity change detection, contributing\nto map maintenance.",

    "summary": "Event cameras, featuring high temporal resolution and high dynamic range,\noffer visual sensing capabilities comparable to conventional image sensors\nwhile capturing fast-moving objects and handling scenes with extreme lighting\ncontrasts such as tunnel exits. Leveraging these properties, this study\nproposes a novel self-localization system that integrates visible light\ncommunication (VLC) and visible light positioning (VLP) within a single event\ncamera. The system enables a vehicle to estimate its position even in\nGPS-denied environments, such as tunnels, by using VLC to obtain coordinate\ninformation from LED transmitters and VLP to estimate the distance to each\ntransmitter.\n  Multiple LEDs are installed on the transmitter side, each assigned a unique\npilot sequence based on Walsh-Hadamard codes. The event camera identifies\nindividual LEDs within its field of view by correlating the received signal\nwith these codes, allowing clear separation and recognition of each light\nsource. This mechanism enables simultaneous high-capacity MISO (multi-input\nsingle-output) communication through VLC and precise distance estimation via\nphase-only correlation (POC) between multiple LED pairs.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first vehicle-mounted system to\nachieve simultaneous VLC and VLP functionalities using a single event camera.\nField experiments were conducted by mounting the system on a vehicle traveling\nat 30 km/h (8.3 m/s).

    "summary": "As robotic systems become increasingly integrated into real-world\nenvironments -- ranging from autonomous vehicles to household assistants --\nthey inevitably encounter diverse and unstructured scenarios that lead to\nfailures. While such failures pose safety and reliability challenges, they also\nprovide rich perceptual data for improving future performance.

In this work,\nwe present a method for automatically organizing large-scale robotic failure\ndata into semantically meaningful failure clusters, enabling scalable learning\nfrom failure without human supervision. Our approach leverages the reasoning\ncapabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), trained on\ninternet-scale data, to infer high-level failure causes from raw perceptual\ntrajectories and discover interpretable structure within uncurated failure\nlogs. These semantic clusters reveal patterns and hypothesized causes of\nfailure, enabling scalable learning from experience. We demonstrate that the\ndiscovered failure modes can guide targeted data collection for policy\nrefinement, accelerating iterative improvement in agent policies and overall\nsafety. Additionally, we show that these semantic clusters can benefit online\nfailure monitoring systems, offering a lightweight yet powerful safeguard for\nreal-time operation.

    "summary": "We present OmniVIC, a universal variable impedance controller (VIC) enhanced\nby a vision language model (VLM), which improves safety and adaptation in any\ncontact-rich robotic manipulation task to enhance safe physical interaction.\nTraditional VIC have shown advantages when the robot physically interacts with\nthe environment, but lack generalization in unseen, complex, and unstructured\nsafe interactions in universal task scenarios involving contact or uncertainty.\nTo this end, the proposed OmniVIC interprets task context derived reasoning\nfrom images and natural language and generates adaptive impedance parameters\nfor a VIC controller. Specifically, the core of OmniVIC is a self-improving\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) and in-context learning (ICL), where RAG\nretrieves relevant prior experiences from a structured memory bank to inform\nthe controller about similar past tasks, and ICL leverages these retrieved\nexamples and the prompt of current task to query the VLM for generating\ncontext-aware and adaptive impedance parameters for the current manipulation\nscenario. Therefore, a self-improved RAG and ICL guarantee OmniVIC works in\nuniversal task scenarios. The impedance parameter regulation is further\ninformed by real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain\nwithin safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on\na suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real-world\nrobotic tasks, with improved success rates and reduced force violations.\nOmniVIC takes a step towards bridging high-level semantic reasoning and\nlow-level compliant control, enabling safer and more generalizable\nmanipulation. Overall, the average success rate increases from 27% (baseline)\nto 61.4% (OmniVIC).",

Unlike traditional crane\nsystems, ship-mounted cranes are consistently subjected to significant external\ndisturbances affecting underactuated crane dynamics due to the ship's dynamic\nmotion response to harsh sea conditions, which can lead to robustness issues.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and safe model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) framework and demonstrate it on a 5-DOF crane system, where a\nStewart platform simulates the external disturbances that ocean surface motions\nwould have on the supporting ship. The crane payload transfer operation must\navoid obstacles and accurately place the payload within a designated target\narea. We use a robust zero-order control barrier function (R-ZOCBF)-based\nsafety constraint in the nonlinear MPC to ensure safe payload positioning,\nwhile time-varying bounding boxes are utilized for collision avoidance.
