    "title": "Recursive Language Models",
    "summary": "We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference paradigm that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs can successfully process inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of vanilla frontier LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks while having comparable cost. At a small scale, we post-train the first natively recursive language model. Our model, RLM-Qwen3-8B, outperforms the underlying Qwen3-8B model by $28.3\\%$ on average and even approaches the quality of vanilla GPT-5 on three long-context tasks.

    "title": "Evolutionary Strategies lead to Catastrophic Forgetting in LLMs",
    "summary": "One of the biggest missing capabilities in current AI systems is the ability to learn continuously after deployment. Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.",

    "summary": "Climate projections have uncertainties related to components of the climate system and their interactions. A typical approach to quantifying these uncertainties is to use climate models to create ensembles of repeated simulations under different initial conditions. Due to the complexity of these simulations, generating such ensembles of projections is computationally expensive. In this work, we present ArchesClimate, a deep learning-based climate model emulator that aims to reduce this cost. ArchesClimate is trained on decadal hindcasts of the IPSL-CM6A-LR climate model at a spatial resolution of approximately 2.5x1.25 degrees. We train a flow matching model following ArchesWeatherGen, which we adapt to predict near-term climate. Once trained, the model generates states at a one-month lead time and can be used to auto-regressively emulate climate model simulations of any length. We show that for up to 10 years, these generations are stable and physically consistent. We also show that for several important climate variables, ArchesClimate generates simulations that are interchangeable with the IPSL model. This work suggests that climate model emulators could significantly reduce the cost of climate model simulations.",

    "summary": "Discrete Combinatorial Problems (DCPs) are prevalent in industrial decision-making and optimisation. However, while constraint solving technologies for DCPs have advanced significantly, the core process of formalising them, namely constraint modelling, requires significant expertise and remains a bottleneck for wider adoption. Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform combinatorial problem descriptions into executable constraint models. However, the existing evaluation datasets for discrete constraint modelling are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific problems, which do not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap by introducing DCP-Bench-Open, a novel benchmark that includes a diverse set of well-known discrete combinatorial problems sourced from the Constraint Programming (CP) and Operations Research (OR) communities, structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven constraint modelling. With this dataset, and given the variety of modelling frameworks, we compare and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax. Notably, the results show higher performance when modelling with a high-level Python-based framework. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods across different LLMs, which further increase accuracy, reaching up to 91% on this highly challenging benchmark. DCP-Bench-Open is publicly available.",

In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We propose a novel benchmark based on Sokoban puzzles, intentionally simplified to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in planning performance when more than 25 moves are required to reach the solution, suggesting a fundamental constraint on forward planning capacity. We show that equipping LRMs with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) parsing, validation, and solving tools allows for modest improvements, suggesting inherent architectural limitations which might not be overcome by test-time scaling approaches alone.",

We introduce SC-SAM, a specialist-generalist framework where U-Net provides point-based prompts and pseudo-labels to guide SAM's adaptation, while SAM serves as a powerful generalist supervisor to regularize U-Net. This reciprocal guidance forms a bidirectional co-training loop that allows both models to effectively exploit the unlabeled data. Across prostate MRI and polyp segmentation benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming other existing semi-supervised SAM variants and even medical foundation models like MedSAM, highlighting the value of specialist-generalist cooperation for label-efficient medical image segmentation.

    "summary": "Tabular data remains a challenging domain for generative models. In particular, the standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, typically composed of multilayer perceptrons, struggles to model relationships between features, especially when handling mixed data types. In contrast, Transformers, through their attention mechanism, are better suited for capturing complex feature interactions. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE. We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions. First, results indicate that positioning Transformers to leverage latent and decoder representations leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity. Second, we observe a high similarity between consecutive blocks of a Transformer in all components. In particular, in the decoder, the relationship between the input and output of a Transformer is approximately linear.",

In this work, we introduce HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology, exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning. To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below the expert baseline of 1.

    "summary": "Despite growing efforts to mitigate unfairness in recommender systems, existing fairness-aware methods typically fix the fairness requirement at training time and provide limited post-training flexibility. However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement.

    "summary": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It \"fails fast\" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and \"wins big\" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.7$\\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.

    "summary": "Road surface classification (RSC) is a key enabler for environment-aware predictive maintenance systems. However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites.",

In addition, we conduct numerical simulation in a more achievable setting, where the ${m\\choose k}$ subset embeddings are chosen as the centroid of the embeddings of the contained elements.

Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks. Our architecture achieved an overall score of 46.21, demonstrating superior performance by surpassing leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher, Nvidia AIQ Research Assistant, Perplexity Research, Kimi Researcher and Grok Deeper Search present on the DeepResearch Bench actively running leaderboard.

    "summary": "Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values but have received less attention than pre-trained and post-trained LLMs themselves. Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the \"Big Two\" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for \"agency\" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for \"communion.\" This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.",

    "summary": "Generating 3D humans that functionally interact with 3D scenes remains an open problem with applications in embodied AI, robotics, and interactive content creation. The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as \"sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., \"increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.",

    "title": "Discrete Variational Autoencoding via Policy Search",
    "summary": "Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions, enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However, discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations, such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional data from compact latent spaces.",

    "summary": "Foundation models rely on in-context learning for personalized decision making. The limited size of this context window necessitates memory compression and retrieval systems like RAG. These systems however often treat memory as large offline storage spaces, which is unfavorable for embodied agents that are expected to operate under strict memory and compute constraints, online. In this work, we propose MemCtrl, a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pruning memory online. MemCtrl augments MLLMs with a trainable memory head μthat acts as a gate to determine which observations or reflections to retain, update, or discard during exploration. We evaluate with training two types of μ, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on μ-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that μ-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by μ, noting the superior performance of μaugmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.",

Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to annotate learning interactions, yet concerns about reliability limit their utility. We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human \"gold\" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication.

We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.",

Although recent works have highlighted that these explanations can be suboptimal and potentially misleading, a characterization of their failure cases is unavailable. In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings.

    "summary": "Large language models are increasingly post-trained with reinforcement learning in verifiable domains such as code and math. Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.",

To address this, we introduce a conditional HPI for top-performing regions and derive a closed-form estimator that accurately reflects conditional activation and domain changes.

We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares.

We quantify this effect with a gender-leaning score that correlates with bias in generated videos.\n  Based on this insight, FairT2V mitigates demographic bias by neutralizing prompt embeddings via anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations while preserving semantics. To maintain temporal coherence, we apply debiasing only during early identity-forming steps through a dynamic denoising schedule. We further propose a video-level fairness evaluation protocol combining VideoLLM-based reasoning with human verification. Experiments on the modern T2V model Open-Sora show that FairT2V substantially reduces demographic bias across occupations with minimal impact on video quality.",

However, creating an analogous representation for ancient logographic writing systems is an extremely labor intensive process that requires expert knowledge. At present, a large portion of logographic data persists in a purely visual form due to the absence of transcription -- this issue poses a bottleneck for researchers seeking to apply NLP toolkits to study ancient logographic languages: most of the relevant data are images of writing.\n  This paper investigates whether direct processing of visual representations of language offers a potential solution. We introduce LogogramNLP, the first benchmark enabling NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages, featuring both transcribed and visual datasets for four writing systems along with annotations for tasks like classification, translation, and parsing. Our experiments compare systems that employ recent visual and text encoding strategies as backbones. The results demonstrate that visual representations outperform textual representations for some investigated tasks, suggesting that visual processing pipelines may unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data of logographic languages for NLP-based analyses.",

At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with LLM-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning.

    "title": "Breaking Bad Molecules: Are MLLMs Ready for Structure-Level Molecular Detoxification?",
    "summary": "Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair, generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity, has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 660 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess 43 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and conduct multiple ablation studies to analyze key issues, including evaluation metrics, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware editing.",

    "summary": "Curriculum learning-organizing training data from easy to hard-has improved efficiency across machine learning domains, yet remains underexplored for language model pretraining. We present the first systematic investigation of curriculum learning in LLM pretraining, with over 200 models trained on up to 100B tokens across three strategies: vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and interleaved curricula, guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and information-theoretic properties. We evaluate performance on eight benchmarks under three realistic scenarios: limited data, unlimited data, and continual training. Our experiments show that curriculum learning consistently accelerates convergence in early and mid-training phases,reducing training steps by $18-45\\%$ to reach baseline performance. When applied as a warmup strategy before standard random sampling, curriculum learning yields sustained improvements up to $3.5\\%$. We identify compression ratio, lexical diversity (MTLD), and readability (Flesch Reading Ease) as the most effective difficulty signals. Our findings demonstrate that data ordering-orthogonal to existing data selection methods-provides a practical mechanism for more efficient LLM pretraining.",

    "summary": "Neuro-symbolic AI systems integrate neural perception with symbolic reasoning to enable data-efficient, interpretable, and robust intelligence beyond purely neural models. Although this compositional paradigm has shown superior performance in domains such as reasoning, planning, and verification, its deployment remains challenging due to severe inefficiencies in symbolic and probabilistic inference. Through systematic analysis of representative neuro-symbolic workloads, we identify probabilistic logical reasoning as the inefficiency bottleneck, characterized by irregular control flow, low arithmetic intensity, uncoalesced memory accesses, and poor hardware utilization on CPUs and GPUs.\n  This paper presents REASON, an integrated acceleration framework for probabilistic logical reasoning in neuro-symbolic AI. REASON introduces a unified directed acyclic graph representation that captures common structure across symbolic and probabilistic models, coupled with adaptive pruning and regularization. At the architecture level, REASON features a reconfigurable, tree-based processing fabric optimized for irregular traversal, symbolic deduction, and probabilistic aggregation. At the system level, REASON is tightly integrated with GPU streaming multiprocessors through a programmable interface and multi-level pipeline that efficiently orchestrates compositional execution. Evaluated across six neuro-symbolic workloads, REASON achieves 12-50x speedup and 310-681x energy efficiency over desktop and edge GPUs under TSMC 28 nm node. REASON enables real-time probabilistic logical reasoning, completing end-to-end tasks in 0.8 s with 6 mm2 area and 2.12 W power, demonstrating that targeted acceleration of probabilistic logical reasoning is critical for practical and scalable neuro-symbolic AI and positioning REASON as a foundational system architecture for next-generation cognitive intelligence.",

    "summary": "In an ordinal election, two candidates are said to be perfect clones if every voter ranks them adjacently. The independence of clones axiom then states that removing one of the two clones should not change the election outcome. This axiom has been extensively studied in social choice theory, and several voting rules are known to satisfy it (such as IRV, Ranked Pairs and Schulze). However, perfect clones are unlikely to occur in practice, especially for political elections with many voters.\n  In this work, we study different notions of approximate clones in ordinal elections. Informally, two candidates are approximate clones in a preference profile if they are close to being perfect clones. We discuss two measures to quantify this proximity, and we show under which conditions the voting rules that are known to be independent of clones are also independent of approximate clones. In particular, we show that for elections with at least four candidates, none of these rules are independent of approximate clones in the general case. However, we find a more positive result for the case of three candidates. Finally, we conduct an empirical study of approximate clones and independence of approximate clones based on three real-world datasets: votes in local Scottish elections, votes in mini-jury deliberations, and votes of judges in figure skating competitions. We find that approximate clones are common in some contexts, and that the closest two candidates are to being perfect clones, the less likely their removal is to change the election outcome, especially for voting rules that are independent of perfect clones.",

Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal balance between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal balance is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.",

The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines.

We posit that actionable definitions of interpretability must be formulated in terms of *symmetries* that inform model design and lead to testable conditions. Under a probabilistic view, we hypothesise that four symmetries (inference equivariance, information invariance, concept-closure invariance, and structural invariance) suffice to (i) formalise interpretable models as a subclass of probabilistic models, (ii) yield a unified formulation of interpretable inference (e.g., alignment, interventions, and counterfactuals) as a form of Bayesian inversion, and (iii) provide a formal framework to verify compliance with safety standards and regulations.",

They spread the fungal-type crayfish plague disease (Aphanomyces astaci) that is lethal to the native white clawed crayfish, the only native crayfish species in Britain. Invasive signal crayfish extensively burrow, causing habitat destruction, erosion of river banks and adverse changes in water quality, while also competing with native species for resources leading to declines in native populations. Moreover, pollution exacerbates the vulnerability of White-clawed crayfish, with their populations declining by over 90%. To safeguard aquatic ecosystems, it is imperative to address the challenges posed by invasive species and pollution in aquatic ecosystem's. This article introduces the Cognitive Edge Device (CED) computing platform for the detection of crayfish and plastic. It also presents two publicly available underwater datasets, annotated with sequences of crayfish and aquatic plastic debris. Four You Only Look Once (YOLO) variants were trained and evaluated for crayfish and plastic object detection.

    "title": "Analysis of approximate linear programming solution to Markov decision problem with log barrier function",
    "summary": "There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs): dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP). Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.",

A built-in respondent simulation generates realistic scenarios, allowing users to rehearse and refine policies and calibrate their use of agentic behavior before live deployment. We evaluate DoubleAgents in a two-day lab study (n = 10), three deployment studies, and a technical evaluation. Results show that participants initially hesitated to delegate but used simulation to probe system behavior and adjust policies, gradually increasing delegation as agent actions became better aligned with their intentions and context. Deployment results demonstrate DoubleAgents' real-world relevance and usefulness, showing that simulation helps users effectively manage real-world tasks with higher complexity and uncertainty. We contribute interactive simulation as a practical pathway for users to iteratively align and calibrate agentic systems.",

Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN (Ma et al., 2021). However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.",

    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, deployment is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory wall, motivating a shift toward extremely low-bit quantization. However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models. These results indicate that Hessian-guided relaxation effectively recovers representational capacity, establishing a more robust training path for 1.58-bit LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/hestia2026/Hestia.",

Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.",

    "title": "FaithSCAN: Model-Driven Single-Pass Hallucination Detection for Faithful Visual Question Answering",
    "summary": "Faithfulness hallucinations in VQA occur when vision-language models produce fluent yet visually ungrounded answers, severely undermining their reliability in safety-critical applications. Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding. Different internal signals provide complementary diagnostic cues, and hallucination patterns vary across VLM architectures, offering new insights into the underlying causes of multimodal hallucinations.",

However, current recommendation systems in dating applications suffer from significant algorithmic deficiencies, including but not limited to popularity bias, filter bubble effects, and inadequate reciprocity modeling that limit effectiveness and introduce harmful biases. This research integrates foundational work with recent empirical findings to deliver a detailed analysis of dating app recommendation systems, highlighting key issues and suggesting research-backed solutions. Through analysis of reciprocal recommendation frameworks, fairness evaluation metrics, and industry implementations, we demonstrate that current systems achieve modest performance with collaborative filtering reaching 25.1\\% while reciprocal methods achieve 28.7\\%. Our proposed mathematical framework addresses these limitations through enhanced similarity measures, multi-objective optimization, and fairness-aware algorithms that maintain competitive accuracy while improving demographic representation to reduce algorithmic bias.",

    "summary": "End-to-end perception and trajectory prediction from raw sensor data is one of the key capabilities for autonomous driving. Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.",

Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \\textit{segment anything} to \\textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

By integrating concept drift detection with dynamic adjustments to learning and exploration hyperparameters, MORPHIN adapts agents to changes in both the reward function and on-the-fly expansions of the agent's action space, while preserving prior policy knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

    "summary": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduce iterative denoising to enable parallel token generation, but their sampling phase displays fundamentally different characteristics compared to GEMM-centric transformer layers. Profiling on modern GPUs reveals that sampling can account for up to 70% of total model inference latency-primarily due to substantial memory loads and writes from vocabulary-wide logits, reduction-based token selection, and iterative masked updates. These processes demand large on-chip SRAM and involve irregular memory accesses that conventional NPUs struggle to handle efficiently. To address this, we identify a set of critical instructions that an NPU architecture must specifically optimize for dLLM sampling. Our design employs lightweight non-GEMM vector primitives, in-place memory reuse strategies, and a decoupled mixed-precision memory hierarchy. Together, these optimizations deliver up to a 2.53x speedup over the NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU under an equivalent nm technology node. We also open-source our cycle-accurate simulation and post-synthesis RTL verification code, confirming functional equivalence with current dLLM PyTorch implementations.",

However, adapting such large-scale models is computationally expensive and still relies on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations. We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability. Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations. Experiments on both user-generated and AI-generated IQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the need for human annotations while maintaining strong MOS-aligned correlations, making lightweight IQA practical under limited annotation budgets.",

    "summary": "We introduce a novel framework for learning context-aware runtime monitors for AI-based control ensembles. Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.",

To address this gap, this work presents the first comprehensive empirical study on applying machine unlearning to mitigate sensitive information leakage in LLMs4Code. We first construct a dedicated benchmark that includes: (i) a synthetic forget set containing diverse forms of personal information, and (ii) a retain set designed to evaluate whether code-generation capability is preserved after unlearning. Using this benchmark, we systematically assess three representative unlearning algorithms (GA, GA+GD, GA+KL) across three widely used open-source LLMs4Code models (AIXCoder-7B, CodeLlama-7B, CodeQwen-7B). Experimental results demonstrate that machine unlearning can substantially reduce direct memorization-based leakage: on average, the direct leak rate drops by more than 50% while retaining about over 91% of the original code-generation performance. Moreover, by analyzing post-unlearning outputs, we uncover a consistent shift from direct to indirect leakage, revealing an underexplored vulnerability that persists even when the target data has been successfully forgotten. Our findings show that machine unlearning is a feasible and effective solution for enhancing privacy protection in LLMs4Code, while also highlighting the need for future techniques capable of mitigating both direct and indirect leakage simultaneously.",

    "summary": "In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics, we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover, we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information removal mechanism and denoising heads.",

    "summary": "Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on consistent decision evidence in both real and simulated environments, not just whether images \"look real\" to humans. To this end this paper proposes a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity, that is, agreement in the model-specific decisive evidence that drives the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.",

    "summary": "Diffusion-based image generative models produce high-fidelity images through iterative denoising but remain vulnerable to memorization, where they unintentionally reproduce exact copies or parts of training images. Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by utilizing a mitigation strategy that adapts memorized prompts based on our developed metric.",

    "summary": "To support long-term interaction in complex environments, LLM agents require memory systems that manage historical experiences. Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) Semantic Structured Compression, which distills unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) Online Semantic Synthesis, an intra-session process that instantly integrates related context into unified abstract representations to eliminate redundancy; and (3) Intent-Aware Retrieval Planning, which infers search intent to dynamically determine retrieval scope and construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.",

    "summary": "Post-training fundamentally alters the behavior of large language models (LLMs), yet its impact on the internal parameter space remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of principal linear layers in pretrained LLMs, focusing on two widely adopted post-training methods: instruction tuning and long-chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) distillation. Our analysis reveals two unexpected and robust structural changes: (1) a near-uniform geometric scaling of singular values across layers; and (2) highly consistent orthogonal transformations are applied to the left and right singular vectors of each matrix. Based on these findings, We propose a simple yet effective framework to describe the coordinated dynamics of parameters in LLMs, which elucidates why post-training inherently relies on the foundational capabilities developed during pre-training. Further experiments demonstrate that singular value scaling underpins the temperature-controlled regulatory mechanisms of post-training, while the coordinated rotation of singular vectors encodes the essential semantic alignment. These results challenge the prevailing view of the parameter space in large models as a black box, uncovering the first clear regularities in how parameters evolve during training, and providing a new perspective for deeper investigation into model parameter changes.",

The method operates directly on audio latents and is compatible with text/audio conditioning (e.g., CLAP).

Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.",

In this paper, we first define such criteria based on a first-principles survey of public administration literature: benchmarks must be \\emph{process-based}, \\emph{realistic}, \\emph{public-sector-specific} and report \\emph{metrics} that reflect the unique requirements of the public sector. We analyse more than 1,300 benchmark papers for these criteria using an expert-validated LLM-assisted pipeline. Our results show that no single benchmark meets all of the criteria. Our findings provide a call to action for both researchers to develop public sector-relevant benchmarks and for public-sector officials to apply these criteria when evaluating their own agentic use cases.",

We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of 1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8 creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness, factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy, while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from 18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale, with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants. Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g., creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather than direct classification.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks.

We ask whether such gains impact membership privacy. Surprisingly, we find that SAM is more prone to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) than classical SGD across multiple datasets and attack methods, despite achieving lower test error. This suggests that the geometric mechanism of SAM that improves generalization simultaneously exacerbates membership leakage. We investigate this phenomenon through extensive analysis of memorization and influence scores. Our results reveal that SAM is more capable of capturing atypical subpatterns, leading to higher memorization scores of samples. Conversely, SGD depends more heavily on majority features, exhibiting worse generalization on atypical subgroups and lower memorization. Crucially, this characteristic of SAM can be linked to lower variance in the prediction confidence of unseen samples, thereby amplifying membership signals. Finally, we model SAM under a perfectly interpolating linear regime and theoretically show that sharpness regularization inherently reduces variance, guaranteeing a higher MIA advantage for confidence and likelihood ratio attacks.",

To solve dynamic unbalanced optimal transport under the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry, we further build on this framework to develop Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Mean Flow Matching (WFR-MFM). Across synthetic and real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, WFR-MFM achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference than a range of existing baselines while maintaining high predictive accuracy, and enables efficient perturbation response prediction on large synthetic datasets with thousands of conditions.",

Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.\n  Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.\n  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of \"VCW as transitional framework.\" Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.\n  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.",

In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction. This study provides an effective solution that balances generalizability and reliability for modality-specific medical image classification tasks.",

We develop a theoretical framework showing that restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, \"deep\" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate homogenous texts, which may impact the diversity of knowledge generated across different outputs. Given their potential to replace existing forms of knowledge acquisition, this poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs may lead most people to be exposed to largely the same information, thus mediating a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time as underepresented knowledge is forgotten. To assess the risk of knowledge collapse with LLMs, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs. We use this to perform a broad empirical study testing 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt templates sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation.",

We propose Ranking-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a novel RL framework that explicitly learns these relationships.

This is driven by a ranking-aware verifiable reward that jointly assesses regression precision and ranking accuracy, facilitating direct model updates via policy optimization. To further enhance training, we introduce Response Mutation Operations (RMO), which inject controlled noise to improve exploration and prevent stagnation at saddle points.

In this paper, we show that disparities arise not only from the structure of the network itself but also from differences in how commuters adapt to it. We model commuters as reinforcement learning agents who adapt their travel choices at different learning rates, reflecting unequal access to resources and information. To capture potential efficiency-fairness tradeoffs, we introduce the Price of Learning (PoL), a measure of inefficiency during learning. We analyze both a stylized network -- inspired in the well-known Braess's paradox, yet with two-source nodes -- and an abstraction of a real-world metro system (Amsterdam). Our simulations show that network expansions can simultaneously increase efficiency and amplify inequality, especially when faster learners disproportionately benefit from new routes before others adapt. These results highlight that transport policies must account not only for equilibrium outcomes but also for the heterogeneous ways commuters adapt, since both shape the balance between efficiency and fairness.",

    "summary": "Specifications for decentralized learning on resource-constrained edge devices require algorithms that are communication-efficient, robust to data corruption, and lightweight in memory usage. While state-of-the-art gossip-based methods satisfy the first requirement, achieving robustness remains challenging. Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods. Finally, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of rank-based trimming via Markov chain theory.",

    "summary": "Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.",

    "summary": "Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include: (1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and (4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.",

A policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR is developed with finite-time performance guarantees that do not depend on the cardinality of the action space. Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $α$, where $α= 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $α< 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.",

We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.",

    "summary": "Large language model-powered multi-agent systems have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex human-like systems. The interactions within these systems often lead to extreme events whose origins remain obscured by the black box of emergence. Interpreting these events is critical for system safety. This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event. We then aggregate the attribution scores along the dimensions of time, agent, and behavior to quantify the risk contribution of each dimension. Finally, we design a set of metrics based on these contribution scores to characterize the features of extreme events. Experiments across diverse multi-agent system scenarios (economic, financial, and social) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide general insights into the emergence of extreme phenomena.",

To address this challenge, this work introduces LLaCTR, a novel and lightweight LLM-enhanced CTR method that employs a field-level enhancement paradigm. Specifically, LLaCTR first utilizes LLMs to distill crucial and lightweight semantic knowledge from small-scale feature fields through self-supervised field-feature fine-tuning. Subsequently, it leverages this field-level semantic knowledge to enhance both feature representation and feature interactions. In our experiments, we integrate LLaCTR with six representative CTR models across four datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing LLM-enhanced methods.

However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.",

Although combinatorial complexes offer a unified topological framework, most existing topological deep learning methods rely on local message passing via attention mechanisms, which incur quadratic complexity and remain low-dimensional, limiting scalability and rank-aware information aggregation in higher-order complexes.We propose Combinatorial Complex Mamba (CCMamba), the first unified mamba-based neural framework for learning on combinatorial complexes. CCMamba reformulates message passing as a selective state-space modeling problem by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models. This enables adaptive, directional, and long range information propagation in linear time without self attention. We further establish the theoretical analysis that the expressive power upper-bound of CCMamba message passing is the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Experiments on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks demonstrate that CCMamba consistently outperforms existing methods while exhibiting improved scalability and robustness to depth.",

A corpus of 12,000 synthetic audio samples was generated using the Daily-Dialog dataset and evaluated against four detection frameworks, including semantic, structural, and signal-level approaches. The results reveal significant variability in detector performance across generative mechanisms: models effective against one TTS architecture may fail against others, particularly LLM-based synthesis. In contrast, a multi-view detection approach combining complementary analysis levels demonstrates robust performance across all evaluated models. These findings highlight the limitations of single-paradigm detectors and emphasize the necessity of integrated detection strategies to address the evolving landscape of audio deepfake threats.",

    "summary": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH) and ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL) are imaging features associated with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) that are visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The development and validation of deep learning models to segment and differentiate these features is difficult because they visually confound each other in the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and often appear in the same subject. We investigated six strategies for training a combined WMH and ISL segmentation model using partially labelled data. We combined privately held fully and partially labelled datasets with publicly available partially labelled datasets to yield a total of 2052 MRI volumes, with 1341 and 1152 containing ground truth annotations for WMH and ISL respectively. We found that several methods were able to effectively leverage the partially labelled data to improve model performance, with the use of pseudolabels yielding the best result.",

    "summary": "The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables the rise of App agents that interpret user intent and operate smartphone Apps through actions such as clicking and scrolling. While prompt-based solutions with proprietary LLM APIs show promising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency. Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current supervised fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically, inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface. Building on this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator~(SEE) to compute a semantic similarity to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the semantics of ground truth actions, even when their syntactic forms differ. SEE is a flexible module that can be applied in both supervised and reinforcement fine-tuning paradigms. To support the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior robustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax learning paradigm. Extensive experiments across multiple offline and online benchmarks demonstrate that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and generalisation of App agents compared to existing methods.",

Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \\emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.",

Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually.",

    "summary": "The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into human group settings raises essential questions about how these novel participants influence cooperative social norms. While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.",

    "summary": "We study sentence-level detection of the 19 human values in the refined Schwartz continuum in about 74k English sentences from news and political manifestos (ValueEval'24 corpus). Each sentence is annotated with value presence, yielding a binary moral-presence label and a 19-way multi-label task under severe class imbalance. First, we show that moral presence is learnable from single sentences: a DeBERTa-base classifier attains positive-class F1 = 0.74 with calibrated thresholds. Second, we compare direct multi-label value detectors with presence-gated hierarchies under a single 8 GB GPU budget. Under matched compute, presence gating does not improve over direct prediction, indicating that gate recall becomes a bottleneck. Third, we investigate lightweight auxiliary signals - short-range context, LIWC-22 and moral lexica, and topic features - and small ensembles. Our best supervised configuration, a soft-voting ensemble of DeBERTa-based models enriched with such signals, reaches macro-F1 = 0.332 on the 19 values, improving over the best previous English-only baseline on this corpus (macro-F1 $\\approx$ 0.28). We additionally benchmark 7-9B instruction-tuned LLMs (Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B) in zero-/few-shot and QLoRA setups, and find that they lag behind the supervised ensemble under the same hardware constraint.

Each edge device organizes local documents into a knowledge graph and periodically uploads subgraph-level summaries to the cloud for lightweight global indexing without exposing raw data. At inference time, queries are first answered on the edge; a gate mechanism assesses the confidence and consistency of multiple local generations to decide whether to return a local answer or escalate the query. For escalated queries, the cloud performs summary-based matching to identify relevant edges, retrieves supporting evidence from them, and generates the final response with a cloud LLM. Experiments on distributed question answering show that DGRAG consistently outperforms decentralized baselines while substantially reducing cloud overhead.",

    "summary": "Adapting large pre-trained language models to downstream tasks often entails fine-tuning millions of parameters or deploying costly dense weight updates, which hinders their use in resource-constrained environments. Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduces trainable parameters by factorizing weight updates, yet the underlying dense weights still impose high storage and computation costs. Magnitude-based pruning can yield sparse models but typically degrades LoRA's performance when applied naively. In this paper, we introduce SALR (Sparsity-Aware Low-Rank Representation), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that unifies low-rank adaptation with sparse pruning under a rigorous mean-squared-error framework. We prove that statically pruning only the frozen base weights minimizes the pruning error bound, and we recover the discarded residual information via a truncated-SVD low-rank adapter, which provably reduces per-entry MSE by a factor of $(1 - r/\\min(d,k))$. To maximize hardware efficiency, we fuse multiple low-rank adapters into a single concatenated GEMM, and we adopt a bitmap-based encoding with a two-stage pipelined decoding + GEMM design to achieve true model compression and speedup. Empirically, SALR attains 50\\% sparsity on various LLMs while matching the performance of LoRA on GSM8K and MMLU, reduces model size by $2\\times$, and delivers up to a $1.7\\times$ inference speedup.",

The framework targets core computational properties, such as determinism, adaptability, and generalisation, that parallel principles observed in biological information processing. Designed to resist brute-force or memorisation-based strategies, AGITB requires autonomous learning across previously unseen environments, in a manner broadly inspired by cortical computation. Preliminary application of AGITB suggests that no contemporary system evaluated to date satisfies all test criteria, indicating that the benchmark provides a structured and interpretable means of assessing progress toward more general learning capabilities.

Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \\textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation.

A problem is that, with increasing numbers of (indistinguishable) objects, the state space grows exponentially. To compute policies, the state space has to be enumerated. Even more possibilities have to be enumerated if the size of the action space depends on the size of the state space, especially if we allow concurrent actions. To tackle the exponential blow-up in the action and state space, we present a first-order representation to store the spaces in polynomial instead of exponential size in the number of objects and introduce Foreplan, a relational forward planner, which uses this representation to efficiently compute policies for numerous indistinguishable objects and actions. Additionally, we introduce an even faster approximate version of Foreplan. Moreover, Foreplan identifies how many objects an agent should act on to achieve a certain task given restrictions. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis and an empirical evaluation of Foreplan, demonstrating a speedup of at least four orders of magnitude.",

While hybrid attention strategies that combine sparse and full attention within a single model offer a viable solution, they typically employ static computation ratios (i.e., fixed proportions of sparse versus full attention) and fail to adapt to the varying sparsity sensitivities of downstream tasks during inference. To address this issue, we propose Elastic Attention, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its overall sparsity based on the input. This is achieved by integrating a lightweight Attention Router into the existing pretrained model, which dynamically assigns each attention head to different computation modes. Within only 12 hours of training on 8xA800 GPUs, our method enables models to achieve both strong performance and efficient inference.

    "summary": "Transformers have revolutionized the field of machine learning. In particular, they can be used to solve complex algorithmic problems, including graph-based tasks. In such algorithmic tasks a key question is what is the minimal size of a transformer that can implement the task. Recent work has begun to explore this problem for graph-based tasks, showing that for sub-linear embedding dimension (i.e., model width) logarithmic depth suffices. However, an open question, which we address here, is what happens if width is allowed to grow linearly, while depth is kept fixed. Here we analyze this setting, and provide the surprising result that with linear width, constant depth suffices for solving a host of graph-based problems. This suggests that a moderate increase in width can allow much shallower models, which are advantageous in terms of inference and train time. For other problems, we show that quadratic width is required. Our results demonstrate the complex and intriguing landscape of transformer implementations of graph-based algorithms. We empirically investigate these trade-offs between the relative powers of depth and width and find tasks where wider models have the same accuracy as deep models, while having much faster train and inference time due to parallelizable hardware.",

    "summary": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is becoming increasingly essential for enhancing the transparency of machine learning (ML) models. Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs.",

    "summary": "Enabling natural communication through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains one of the most profound challenges in neuroscience and neurotechnology. While existing frameworks offer partial solutions, they are constrained by oversimplified semantic representations and a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semantic Intent Decoding (SID), a novel framework that translates neural activity into natural language by modeling meaning as a flexible set of compositional semantic units. SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID. BrainMosaic decodes multiple semantic units from EEG/SEEG signals using set matching and then reconstructs coherent sentences through semantic-guided reconstruction. This approach moves beyond traditional pipelines that rely on fixed-class classification or unconstrained generation, enabling a more interpretable and expressive communication paradigm. Extensive experiments on multilingual EEG and clinical SEEG datasets demonstrate that SID and BrainMosaic offer substantial advantages over existing frameworks, paving the way for natural and effective BCI-mediated communication.",

    "summary": "It is well understood that different neural network architectures are suited to different tasks, but is there always a single best architecture for a given task? We compare the expressive power of transformers, RNNs, and transformers with chain of thought tokens on a simple and natural class of tasks we term Compositional Reasoning Questions (CRQ). This family captures multi-step problems with tree-like compositional structure, such as evaluating Boolean formulas. We prove that under standard hardness assumptions, \\emph{none} of these three architectures is capable of solving CRQs unless some hyperparameter (depth, embedding dimension, and number of chain of thought tokens, respectively) grows with the size of the input. We then provide constructions for solving CRQs with each architecture. For transformers, our construction uses depth that is logarithmic in the problem size. For RNNs, logarithmic embedding dimension is necessary and sufficient, so long as the inputs are provided in a certain order. For transformers with chain of thought, our construction uses $n$ CoT tokens for input size $n$. These results show that, while CRQs are inherently hard, there are several different ways for language models to overcome this hardness. Even for a single class of problems, each architecture has strengths and weaknesses, and none is strictly better than the others.",

    "summary": "Audio watermarking embeds auxiliary information into speech while maintaining speaker identity, linguistic content, and perceptual quality. Although recent advances in neural and digital signal processing-based watermarking methods have improved imperceptibility and embedding capacity, robustness is still primarily assessed against conventional distortions such as compression, additive noise, and resampling. However, the rise of deep learning-based attacks introduces novel and significant threats to watermark security. In this work, we investigate self voice conversion as a universal, content-preserving attack against audio watermarking systems. Self voice conversion remaps a speaker's voice to the same identity while altering acoustic characteristics through a voice conversion model. We demonstrate that this attack severely degrades the reliability of state-of-the-art watermarking approaches and highlight its implications for the security of modern audio watermarking techniques.",

    "summary": "This position paper argues that the next generation of artificial intelligence in meteorological and climate sciences must transition from fragmented hybrid heuristics toward a unified paradigm of physics-guided multimodal transformers. While purely data-driven models have achieved significant gains in predictive accuracy, they often treat atmospheric processes as mere visual patterns, frequently producing results that lack scientific consistency or violate fundamental physical laws. We contend that current ``hybrid'' attempts to bridge this gap remain ad-hoc and struggle to scale across the heterogeneous nature of meteorological data ranging from satellite imagery to sparse sensor measurements. We argue that the transformer architecture, through its inherent capacity for cross-modal alignment, provides the only viable foundation for a systematic integration of domain knowledge via physical constraint embedding and physics-informed loss functions. By advocating for this unified architectural shift, we aim to steer the community away from ``black-box'' curve fitting and toward AI systems that are inherently falsifiable, scientifically grounded, and robust enough to address the existential challenges of extreme weather and climate change.",

We present a hybrid moderation framework deployed at production scale that combines supervised classification for known violations with reference-based similarity matching for novel or subtle cases. This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight. In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision. Large-scale A/B tests show a 6-8% reduction in user views of unwanted livestreams}. These results demonstrate a scalable and adaptable approach to multimodal content governance, capable of addressing both explicit violations and emerging adversarial behaviors.",

    "summary": "In recent years, the explosive advancement of deepfake technology has posed a critical and escalating threat to public security: diffusion-based digital human generation. Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency via multimodal control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the new large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion models. Leveraging five of the latest digital human generation methods and a voice cloning method, we systematically construct a dataset comprising 60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data diversity and realism. User studies demonstrate that the misrecognition rate by participants for DigiFakeAV reaches as high as 68%. Moreover, the substantial performance degradation of existing detection models on our dataset further highlights its challenges. To address this problem, we propose DigiShield, an effective detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the DigiFakeAV and shows strong generalization on other datasets.",

    "summary": "Modern content platforms offer paid promotion to mitigate cold start by allocating exposure via auctions. Our empirical analysis reveals a counterintuitive flaw in this paradigm: while promotion rescues low-to-medium quality content, it can harm high-quality content by forcing exposure to suboptimal audiences, polluting engagement signals and downgrading future recommendation. We recast content promotion as a dual-objective optimization that balances short-term value acquisition with long-term model improvement. To make this tractable at bid time in content promotion, we introduce a decomposable surrogate objective, gradient coverage, and establish its formal connection to Fisher Information and optimal experimental design. We design a two-stage auto-bidding algorithm based on Lagrange duality that dynamically paces budget through a shadow price and optimizes impression-level bids using per-impression marginal utilities. To address missing labels at bid time, we propose a confidence-gated gradient heuristic, paired with a zeroth-order variant for black-box models that reliably estimates learning signals in real time. We provide theoretical guarantees, proving monotone submodularity of the composite objective, sublinear regret in online auction, and budget feasibility. Extensive offline experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the framework: it outperforms baselines, achieves superior final AUC/LogLoss, adheres closely to budget targets, and remains effective when gradients are approximated zeroth-order. These results show that strategic, information-aware promotion can improve long-term model performance and organic outcomes beyond naive impression-maximization strategies.",

However, we find that both fine-grained text descriptions and localized image patches often contain redundant information, making text-visual alignment less effective.

BiFTA achieves superior zero-shot performance on 6 benchmark datasets for both ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP, justifying the necessity to remove redundant information in visual-text alignment.",

Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We use TLA+, the de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages. We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes eleven diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the leader election of ZooKeeper, the Spinlock, Mutex, and Ringbuffer in Asterinas OS, etc., with more being added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and opening up promising new research directions.",

    "summary": "Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information, enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text. Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To facilitate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR), which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M$^3$CoT and ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance increase of 5.45\\% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase of over 5 times compared to existing approaches.",

We measure wall-clock execution time and token usage during agent execution. Our results show that the presence of AGENTS.md is associated with a lower median runtime ($Δ28.64$%) and reduced output token consumption ($Δ16.58$%), while maintaining a comparable task completion behavior.

Contemporary learning techniques primarily focus on structured learning paths, knowledge tracing, and generic adaptive testing but fail to address real-time learning challenges driven by cognitive load, attention fluctuations, and engagement levels. Building on findings from a formative user study (N=66), we introduce GuideAI, a multi-modal framework that enhances LLM-driven learning by integrating real-time biosensory feedback including eye gaze tracking, heart rate variability, posture detection, and digital note-taking behavior. GuideAI dynamically adapts learning content and pacing through cognitive optimizations (adjusting complexity based on learning progress markers), physiological interventions (breathing guidance and posture correction), and attention-aware strategies (redirecting focus using gaze analysis). Additionally, GuideAI supports diverse learning modalities, including text-based, image-based, audio-based, and video-based instruction, across varied knowledge domains. A preliminary study (N = 25) assessed GuideAI's impact on knowledge retention and cognitive load through standardized assessments. The results show statistically significant improvements in both problem-solving capability and recall-based knowledge assessments. Participants also experienced notable reductions in key NASA-TLX measures including mental demand, frustration levels, and effort, while simultaneously reporting enhanced perceived performance. These findings demonstrate GuideAI's potential to bridge the gap between current LLM-based learning systems and individualized learner needs, paving the way for adaptive, cognition-aware education at scale.",

We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning approach that allows to directly fine-tune LLMs to express calibrated confidence estimates alongside their answers to factual questions. Our method optimizes a reward based on the logarithmic scoring rule, explicitly penalizing both over- and under-confidence. This encourages the model to align its confidence estimates with the actual predictive accuracy. The optimal policy under our reward design would result in perfectly calibrated confidence expressions. Unlike prior approaches that decouple confidence estimation from response generation, our method integrates confidence calibration seamlessly into the generative process of the LLM. Empirically, we demonstrate that models trained with our approach exhibit substantially improved calibration and generalize to unseen tasks without further fine-tuning, suggesting the emergence of general confidence awareness.",

    "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex, long-horizon reasoning due to instability caused by their frozen policy assumption. Current test-time scaling methods treat execution feedback merely as an external signal for filtering or rewriting trajectories, without internalizing it to improve the underlying reasoning strategy. Inspired by Popper's epistemology of \"conjectures and refutations,\" we argue that intelligence requires real-time evolution of the model's policy through learning from failed attempts. We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.",

    "summary": "Can standard continuous-time generative models represent distributions whose support is an extremely sparse, globally constrained discrete set? We study this question using completed Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, treating them as a subset of a continuous relaxation space. We train flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path and compare deterministic (ODE) sampling, stochastic (SDE) sampling, and DDPM-style discretizations derived from the same continuous-time training. Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.",

To address this limitation, we propose SwitchCodec, a neural audio codec based on Residual Experts Vector Quantization (REVQ). REVQ combines a shared quantizer with dynamically routed expert quantizers that are activated according to the input audio, decoupling bitrate from codebook capacity and improving compression efficiency. This design ensures full training and utilization of each quantizer. In addition, a variable-bitrate mechanism adjusts the number of active expert quantizers at inference, enabling multi-bitrate operation without retraining. Experiments demonstrate that SwitchCodec surpasses existing baselines on both objective metrics and subjective listening tests.",

Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.",

Simply speaking, GenCode follows a generation-and-selection paradigm to prepare useful training code data. Specifically, it employs code augmentation techniques to generate new code candidates first and then identifies important ones as the training data by influence scores. To evaluate the effectiveness of GenCode, we conduct experiments on four code understanding tasks (e.g., code clone detection) and three pre-trained code models (e.g., CodeT5) and two recent released code-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder). Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) code augmentation method MixCode, GenCode produces pre-trained code models with 2.92% higher accuracy and 4.90% adversarial robustness on average. For code-specific LLMs, GenCode achieves an average improvement of 0.93% in accuracy and 0.98% in natural robustness.",

    "summary": "Ransomware has become one of the most serious cybersecurity threats causing major financial losses and operational disruptions worldwide.Traditional detection methods such as static analysis, heuristic scanning and behavioral analysis often fall short when used alone. To address these limitations, this paper presents multimodal multi agent ransomware analysis framework designed for ransomware classification. Proposed multimodal multiagent architecture combines information from static, dynamic and network sources. Each data type is handled by specialized agent that uses auto encoder based feature extraction. These representations are then integrated through a fusion agent. After that fused representation are used by transformer based classifier. It identifies the specific ransomware family. The agents interact through an interagent feedback mechanism that iteratively refines feature representations by suppressing low confidence information. The framework was evaluated on large scale datasets containing thousands of ransomware and benign samples. Multiple experiments were conducted on ransomware dataset. It outperforms single modality and nonadaptive fusion baseline achieving improvement of up to 0.936 in Macro-F1 for family classification and reducing calibration error. Over 100 epochs, the agentic feedback loop displays a stable monotonic convergence leading to over +0.75 absolute improvement in terms of agent quality and a final composite score of around 0.88 without fine tuning of the language models. Zeroday ransomware detection remains family dependent on polymorphism and modality disruptions. Confidence aware abstention enables reliable real world deployment by favoring conservativeand trustworthy decisions over forced classification. The findings indicate that proposed approach provides a practical andeffective path toward improving real world ransomware defense systems.",

To tackle these challenges, we present ReMemR1, which integrates the mechanism of memory retrieval into the memory update process, enabling the agent to selectively callback historical memories for non-linear reasoning. To further strengthen training, we propose a multi-level reward design, which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate information degradation, improve supervision, and support complex multi-hop reasoning.

To addressing these limitations, we propose MobileBench-OL, an online benchmark with 1080 tasks from 80 Chinese apps. It measures task execution, complex reasoning, and noise robustness of agents by including 5 subsets, which set multiple evaluation dimensions. We also provide an auto-eval framework with a reset mechanism, enabling stable and repeatable real-world benchmarking. Evaluating 12 leading GUI agents on MobileBench-OL shows significant room for improvement to meet real-world requirements. Human evaluation further confirms that MobileBench-OL can reliably measure the performance of leading GUI agents in real environments. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.",

    "summary": "Robotic manipulation has increasingly adopted vision-language-action (VLA) models, which achieve strong performance but typically require task-specific demonstrations and fine-tuning, and often generalize poorly under domain shift. We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

    "summary": "Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have rapidly expanded to electrocardiograms, focusing on classification, report generation, and single-turn QA tasks. However, these models fall short in real-world scenarios, lacking multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise understanding of ECG measurements such as the PQRST intervals. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue. To facilitate its development and evaluation, we also present ECG-Multi-Turn-Dialogue (ECG-MTD) dataset, a collection of realistic user-assistant multi-turn dialogues for diverse ECG lead configurations. We develop ECG-Agents in various sizes, from on-device capable to larger agents. Experimental results show that ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in response accuracy. Furthermore, on-device agents achieve comparable performance to larger agents in various evaluations that assess response accuracy, tool-calling ability, and hallucinations, demonstrating their viability for real-world applications.",

    "summary": "Long-context LLM inference is bottlenecked by the quadratic attention complexity and linear KV cache growth. Prior approaches mitigate this via post-hoc selection or eviction but overlook the root inefficiency: indiscriminate writing to memory. In this paper, we formalize KV cache management as a causal system of three primitives: KV Admission, Selection, and Eviction. We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV (WG-KV), a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before cache entry. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, WG-KV reduces memory usage by 46-68% and delivers 3.03-3.70x prefill and 1.85-2.56x decode speedups on Llama and Qwen models, while maintaining compatibility with FlashAttention and Paged-KV systems. These results demonstrate that learning what to write is a principled and practical recipe for efficient long-context inference. Code is available at https://github.com/EMCLab-Sinica/WG-KV.",

    "summary": "Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning. Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models, even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3) Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath, LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are vital for a wide range of applications yet remain susceptible to jailbreak threats, which could lead to the generation of inappropriate responses. Conventional defenses, such as refusal and adversarial training, often fail to cover corner cases or rare domains, leaving LLMs still vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks. We propose a novel defense strategy, Safety Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which harnesses the enhanced \\textit{reasoning capabilities} of LLMs for proactive assessment of harmful inputs, rather than simply blocking them. SCoT augments any refusal training datasets to critically analyze the intent behind each request before generating answers. By employing proactive reasoning, SCoT enhances the generalization of LLMs across varied harmful queries and scenarios not covered in the safety alignment corpus. Additionally, it generates detailed refusals specifying the rules violated. Comparative evaluations show that SCoT significantly surpasses existing defenses, reducing vulnerability to out-of-distribution issues and adversarial manipulations while maintaining strong general capabilities.",

    "title": "Diffusion Generative Recommendation with Continuous Tokens",
    "summary": "Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that ContRec consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems.",

Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.",

To address this limitation, we propose a memorization-based framework that accelerates Anchors while preserving explanation fidelity and interpretability. Our approach leverages the iterative nature of Anchors' algorithm which gradually refines an explanation until it is precise enough for a given input by storing and reusing intermediate results obtained during prior explanations. Specifically, we maintain a memory of low-precision, high-coverage rules and introduce a rule transformation framework to adapt them to new inputs: the horizontal transformation adapts a pre-trained explanation to the current input by replacing features, and the vertical transformation refines the general explanation until it is precise enough for the input. We evaluate our method across tabular, text, and image datasets, demonstrating that it significantly reduces explanation generation time while maintaining fidelity and interpretability, thereby enabling the practical adoption of Anchors in time-sensitive applications.",

We present SuperInfer, a high-performance LLM inference system designed for emerging Superchips (e.g., NVIDIA GH200) with tightly coupled GPU-CPU architecture via NVLink-C2C. SuperInfer introduces RotaSched, the first proactive, SLO-aware rotary scheduler that rotates requests to maintain responsiveness on Superchips, and DuplexKV, an optimized rotation engine that enables full-duplex transfer over NVLink-C2C. Evaluations on GH200 using various models and datasets show that SuperInfer improves TTFT SLO attainment rates by up to 74.7% while maintaining comparable TBT and throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating that SLO-aware scheduling and memory co-design unlocks the full potential of Superchips for responsive LLM serving.",

We identify this as a Cognitive Gap: the model lacks the understanding of how to enhance its own generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose Endogenous Reprompting, a mechanism that transforms the model's understanding from a passive encoding process into an explicit generative reasoning step by generating self-aligned descriptors during generation. To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy. Experiments show that SEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality, without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities.",

    "summary": "The application of iodinated contrast media (ICM) improves the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography (CT) for a wide range of clinical indications. However, overdose of ICM can cause problems such as kidney damage and life-threatening allergic reactions. Deep learning methods can generate CT images of normal-dose ICM from low-dose ICM, reducing the required dose while maintaining diagnostic power. However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process. Subsequently, semantic supervision strategy with spatial intelligence is introduced, which integrates the functions of visual perception and spatial reasoning, thus prompting the model to achieve accurate enhancement. Finally, the subtraction angiography enhancement module is applied, which serves to improve the contrast of the ICM agent region to suitable interval for observation. Qualitative analysis of visual comparison and quantitative results of several metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in angiographic reconstruction for low-dose contrast medium CT angiography.",

Consequently, mass prediction from pixels is ill-posed and therefore benefits from physically meaningful representations to constrain the space of plausible solutions. We propose a physically structured framework for single-image mass estimation that addresses this ambiguity by aligning visual cues with the physical factors governing mass. From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision.

    "summary": "Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has recently emerged as an effective technique for improving DNN robustness to input variations. However, its interplay with the compactness requirements of on-device DNN deployments remains less explored. Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet hallucinate on knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.",

    "title": "Truthfulness Despite Weak Supervision: Evaluating and Training LLMs Using Peer Prediction",
    "summary": "The evaluation and post-training of large language models (LLMs) rely on supervision, but strong supervision for difficult tasks is often unavailable, especially when evaluating frontier models. In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.",

Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects.

    "summary": "Recent advances in multi-modal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have shown significant ability to interpret complex visual content. While these models enable impressive reasoning capabilities, they also introduce novel and underexplored privacy risks. In this paper, we identify a novel category of privacy leakage in MLRMs: Adversaries can infer sensitive geolocation information, such as a user's home address or neighborhood, from user-generated images, including selfies captured in private settings. To formalize and evaluate these risks, we propose a three-level visual privacy risk framework that categorizes image content based on contextual sensitivity and potential for location inference. We further introduce DoxBench, a curated dataset of 500 real-world images reflecting diverse privacy scenarios. Our evaluation across 11 advanced MLRMs and MLLMs demonstrates that these models consistently outperform non-expert humans in geolocation inference and can effectively leak location-related private information. This significantly lowers the barrier for adversaries to obtain users' sensitive geolocation information. We further analyze and identify two primary factors contributing to this vulnerability: (1) MLRMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities by leveraging visual clues in combination with their internal world knowledge; and (2) MLRMs frequently rely on privacy-related visual clues for inference without any built-in mechanisms to suppress or avoid such usage. To better understand and demonstrate real-world attack feasibility, we propose GeoMiner, a collaborative attack framework that decomposes the prediction process into two stages: clue extraction and reasoning to improve geolocation performance while introducing a novel attack perspective. Our findings highlight the urgent need to reassess inference-time privacy risks in MLRMs to better protect users' sensitive information.",

The benchmark encompasses tasks that range from basic auditory comparisons to contextually grounded reasoning, enabling fine-grained analysis of how models process and integrate auditory concepts. In addition, we introduce AIR-CoT, a novel auditory imagination reasoning method that generates and integrates auditory information during inference through span detection with special tokens and knowledge injection.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the $Δ$-th sub-diagonal for some offset $Δ$. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.",

However, as forecasting models approach diminishing returns in accuracy, a critical yet underexplored opportunity emerges: the strategic use of post-processing. In this paper, we address the last-mile gap in time-series forecasting, which is to improve accuracy and uncertainty without retraining or modifying a deployed backbone. We propose $δ$-Adapter, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic way to boost deployed time series forecasters without retraining. $δ$-Adapter learns tiny, bounded modules at two interfaces: input nudging (soft edits to covariates) and output residual correction. We provide local descent guarantees, $O(δ)$ drift bounds, and compositional stability for combined adapters. Meanwhile, it can act as a feature selector by learning a sparse, horizon-aware mask over inputs to select important features, thereby improving interpretability. In addition, it can also be used as a distribution calibrator to measure uncertainty. Thus, we introduce a Quantile Calibrator and a Conformal Corrector that together deliver calibrated, personalized intervals with finite-sample coverage. Our experiments across diverse backbones and datasets show that $δ$-Adapter improves accuracy and calibration with negligible compute and no interface changes.",

    "summary": "When humans face problems beyond their immediate capabilities, they rely on tools, providing a promising paradigm for improving visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \\textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw.",

However, the popular Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) evaluation mostly measures benign span localization. The needle is near-unique, and the haystack is largely irrelevant. We introduce EverMemBench-S (EMB-S), an adversarial NIAH-style benchmark built on a 326M-token MemoryBank. While the full MemoryBank spans 326M tokens for retrieval-based (RAG) evaluation, we evaluate native long-context models only at scales that fit within each model's context window (up to 1M tokens in this work) to ensure a fair comparison. EMB-S pairs queries with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets spanning one or more documents, validated via human screening and LLM verification. We also propose a decoupled diagnostic protocol that reports evidence access (document-ID localization) separately from end-to-end QA quality under full-context prompting. This enables consistent diagnosis for both native long-context prompting and retrieval pipelines. Across a reference-corpus ladder from domain-isolated 64K contexts to a globally shared 326M-token environment, we observe a clear reality gap. Systems that saturate benign NIAH degrade sharply in evidence access under semantic interference. These results indicate that semantic discrimination, not context length alone, is the dominant bottleneck for long-context memory at scale.",

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising results in phishing URL detection. However, their reasoning capabilities that enabled such performance remain underexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Least-to-Most prompting framework for phishing URL detection. In particular, we introduce an \"answer sensitivity\" mechanism that guides Least-to-Most's iterative approach to enhance reasoning and yield higher prediction accuracy. We evaluate our framework using three URL datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing against a one-shot approach and a supervised model. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the one-shot baseline while achieving performance comparable to that of the supervised model, despite requiring significantly less training data. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis highlights how the iterative reasoning enabled by Least-to-Most, and reinforced by our answer sensitivity mechanism, drives these performance gains. Overall, we show that this simple yet powerful prompting strategy consistently outperforms both one-shot and supervised approaches, despite requiring minimal training or few-shot guidance.

However, parameter estimation for SDEs typically relies on accurately timestamped observational sequences. When temporal ordering information is corrupted, missing, or deliberately hidden (e.g., for privacy), existing estimation methods often fail. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which temporal order can be recovered and introduce a novel framework that simultaneously reconstructs temporal information and estimates SDE parameters. Our approach exploits asymmetries between forward and backward processes, deriving a score-matching criterion to infer the correct temporal order between pairs of observations. We then recover the total order via a sorting procedure and estimate SDE parameters from the reconstructed sequence using maximum likelihood. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, extending parameter estimation to settings with missing temporal order and broadening applicability in sensitive domains.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been largely driven by scaling laws for individual models, which predict performance improvements as model parameters and data volume increase. However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.",

This agent exhibits outstanding performance in: (1) planning econometric tasks strategically, (2) generating and executing code, (3) employing error-based reflection for improved robustness, and (4) allowing iterative refinement through multi-round conversations. We construct two datasets from academic coursework materials and published research papers to evaluate performance against real-world challenges. Comparative testing shows our domain-specialized AI agent significantly outperforms both benchmark large language models (LLMs) and general-purpose AI agents. This work establishes a testbed for exploring AI's impact on social science research and enables cost-effective integration of domain expertise, making advanced econometric methods accessible to users with minimal coding skills. Furthermore, our AI agent enhances research reproducibility and offers promising pedagogical applications for econometrics teaching.",

    "title": "SiNGER: A Clearer Voice Distills Vision Transformers Further",
    "summary": "Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \\oursname consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.",

    "title": "OmniEVA: Embodied Versatile Planner via Task-Adaptive 3D-Grounded and Embodiment-aware Reasoning",
    "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making. Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid but practically infeasible. To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks, including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io",

    "summary": "Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model student's knowledge state and predict future performance to enable personalized learning in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. However, traditional KT methods face fundamental limitations in explainability, as they rely solely on the response correctness, neglecting the rich information embedded in students' problem-solving processes. To address this gap, we propose Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Problem-Solving Process (KT-PSP), which incorporates students' problem-solving processes to capture the multidimensional aspects of mathematical proficiency. We also introduce KT-PSP-25, a new dataset specifically designed for the KT-PSP. Building on this, we present StatusKT, a KT framework that employs a teacher-student-teacher three-stage LLM pipeline to extract students' MP as intermediate signals. In this pipeline, the teacher LLM first extracts problem-specific proficiency indicators, then a student LLM generates responses based on the student's solution process, and a teacher LLM evaluates these responses to determine mastery of each indicator. The experimental results on KT-PSP-25 demonstrate that StatusKT improves the prediction performance of existing KT methods. Moreover, StatusKT provides interpretable explanations for its predictions by explicitly modeling students' mathematical proficiency.",

This challenge is especially acute in practice-based domains, where knowledge is procedural and grounded in professional judgment, while most existing LLM benchmarks depend on pre-existing human exam datasets that are often unavailable in such settings. We introduce a framework for automated benchmark generation from expert-authored guidelines informed by Bloom's Taxonomy. It converts expert practices into implicit violation-based scenarios and expands them into auto-graded multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and multi-turn dialogues across four cognitive levels, enabling deterministic, reproducible, and scalable evaluation. Applied to three applied domains: teaching, dietetics, and caregiving, we find differences between model and human-like reasoning: LLMs sometimes perform relatively better on higher-order reasoning (Analyze) but fail more frequently on lower-level items (Remember). We produce large-scale, psychometrically informed benchmarks that surface these non-intuitive model behaviors and enable evaluation of contextualized reasoning in real-world settings.",

    "summary": "Rapid advancements in foundation models, including Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, and Vision-Language-Action Models, have opened new avenues for embodied AI in mobile service robotics. By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interaction, mobile service robots can achieve more flexible understanding, adaptive behavior, and robust task execution in dynamic real-world environments. Despite this progress, embodied AI for mobile service robots continues to face fundamental challenges related to the translation of natural language instructions into executable robot actions, multimodal perception in human-centered environments, uncertainty estimation for safe decision-making, and computational constraints for real-time onboard deployment. In this paper, we present the first systematic review focused specifically on the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics. We analyze how recent advances in foundation models address these core challenges through language-conditioned control, multimodal sensor fusion, uncertainty-aware reasoning, and efficient model scaling. We further examine real-world applications in domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation, highlighting how foundation models enable context-aware, socially responsive, and generalizable robot behaviors. Beyond technical considerations, we discuss ethical, societal, and human-interaction implications associated with deploying foundation model-enabled service robots in human environments. Finally, we outline future research directions emphasizing reliability and lifelong adaptation, privacy-aware and resource-constrained deployment, and governance and human-in-the-loop frameworks required for safe, scalable, and trustworthy mobile service robotics.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can be benchmark-contaminated, resulting in inflated scores that mask memorization as generalization, and in multilingual settings, this memorization can even transfer to \"uncontaminated\" languages. Using the FLORES-200 translation benchmark as a diagnostic, we study two 7-8B instruction-tuned multilingual LLMs: Bloomz, which was trained on FLORES, and Llama as an uncontaminated control. We confirm Bloomz's FLORES contamination and demonstrate that machine translation contamination can be cross-directional, artificially boosting performance in unseen translation directions due to target-side memorization. Further analysis shows that recall of memorized references often persists despite various source-side perturbation efforts like paraphrasing and named entity replacement. However, replacing named entities leads to a consistent decrease in BLEU, suggesting an effective probing method for memorization in contaminated models.",

Our evaluation reveals that while all multimodal LLMs outperform our heuristic baseline, even the best-performing model we consider experiences a substantial drop in performance when character identities of the conversation are anonymized. Beyond evaluation, we carry out a sociolinguistic analysis of 350,842 utterances in TVQA. We find that while female characters initiate conversations at rates in proportion to their speaking time, they are 1.2 times more likely than men to be cast as an addressee or side-participant, and the presence of side-participants shifts the conversational register from personal to social.",

    "summary": "Language model representations often contain linear directions that correspond to high-level concepts. Here, we study the dynamics of these representations: how representations evolve along these dimensions within the context of (simulated) conversations. We find that linear representations can change dramatically over a conversation; for example, information that is represented as factual at the beginning of a conversation can be represented as non-factual at the end and vice versa. These changes are content-dependent; while representations of conversation-relevant information may change, generic information is generally preserved. These changes are robust even for dimensions that disentangle factuality from more superficial response patterns, and occur across different model families and layers of the model. These representation changes do not require on-policy conversations; even replaying a conversation script written by an entirely different model can produce similar changes. However, adaptation is much weaker from simply having a sci-fi story in context that is framed more explicitly as such. We also show that steering along a representational direction can have dramatically different effects at different points in a conversation. These results are consistent with the idea that representations may evolve in response to the model playing a particular role that is cued by a conversation. Our findings may pose challenges for interpretability and steering -- in particular, they imply that it may be misleading to use static interpretations of features or directions, or probes that assume a particular range of features consistently corresponds to a particular ground-truth value. However, these types of representational dynamics also point to exciting new research directions for understanding how models adapt to context.",

For each domain, we compile datasets with human-aligned creative and uncreative examples and evaluate each metric's ability to discriminate between the two sets. Our analyses reveal limited consistency both across domains and metrics, as metrics that distinguish creativity in one domain fail in others (e.g., CI correctly distinguishes in creative writing but fails in problem-solving), and different metrics often disagree on the same data points (e.g., CI suggests one set to be more creative, while perplexity indicates the other set to be more creative.) We highlight key limitations, such as perplexity reflecting fluency rather than novelty; LLM-as-a-Judge producing inconsistent judgments under minor prompt variations and exhibiting bias towards particular labels; CI primarily measuring lexical diversity, with high sensitivity to implementation choices; and syntactic templates being ineffective in settings dominated by formulaic language. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human judgments of creativity.",

Specifically, we introduce a novel strategy for example selection, in which new examples are selected based on the similarity of their underlying syntactic-semantic structure to the provided one-shot example. We show that this method results in complementary word choices and sentence structures when compared to LLM-generated examples. When these strategies are combined, the resulting hybrid system achieves a more holistic picture of the relations of interest than either method alone. Our framework transfers well across datasets (FS-TACRED and FS-FewRel) and LLM families (Qwen and Gemma). Overall, our hybrid selection method consistently outperforms alternative strategies and achieves state-of-the-art performance on FS-TACRED and strong gains on a customized FewRel subset.",

Motivated by this phenomenon, we ask: how do transformers learn to associate information across modalities from in-context examples? We investigate this question through controlled experiments on small transformers trained on synthetic classification tasks, enabling precise manipulation of data statistics and model architecture. We begin by revisiting core principles of unimodal ICL in modern transformers. While several prior findings replicate, we find that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) increases the data complexity threshold for ICL. Extending to the multimodal setting reveals a fundamental learning asymmetry: when pretrained on high-diversity data from a primary modality, surprisingly low data complexity in the secondary modality suffices for multimodal ICL to emerge. Mechanistic analysis shows that both settings rely on an induction-style mechanism that copies labels from matching in-context exemplars; multimodal training refines and extends these circuits across modalities. Our findings provide a mechanistic foundation for understanding multimodal ICL in modern transformers and introduce a controlled testbed for future investigation.",

We identify a structural pattern we call jurisdiction-siloed disclosure: information about data practices appearing in specific, actionable form only within regional compliance sections labeled \"California Residents\" or \"EU/UK Users,\" while general sections use vague or qualified language for the same practices.\n  Our audit of 123 major companies identifies 282 potential instances across 77 companies (62.6% of this purposive sample). A conservative estimate restricted to practice categories validated against OPP-115 human annotations finds 138 instances across 54 companies (44%); post-2018 categories central to our findings await independent validation. If users skip jurisdiction-labeled sections as information foraging theory predicts, users outside regulated jurisdictions would receive less specific information about practices affecting them--a transparency failure operating through document architecture rather than omission.\n  We propose universal substantive disclosure: practices affecting all users should appear in the main policy body, with regional sections containing only procedural rights information. This standard finds support in analogous disclosure regimes (securities, truth-in-lending, nutritional labeling) where material information must reach all affected parties. Regulators could operationalize this through the FTC's \"clear and conspicuous\" standard and GDPR transparency principles.\n  This work is hypothesis-generating: we establish that the structural pattern exists and ground the transparency concern in behavioral theory, but direct measurement of jurisdiction-specific section skipping remains the critical validation priority.

Yet the cost and complexity of training has kept this advantage theoretical. We show it is now practical. We present Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents (SERA), an efficient method for training coding agents that enables the rapid and cheap creation of agents specialized to private codebases. Using only supervised finetuning (SFT), SERA achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open-source (open data, method, code) models while matching the performance of frontier open-weight models like Devstral-Small-2. Creating SERA models is 26x cheaper than reinforcement learning and 57x cheaper than previous synthetic data methods to reach equivalent performance. Our method, Soft Verified Generation (SVG), generates thousands of trajectories from a single code repository. Combined with cost-efficiency, this enables specialization to private codebases. Beyond repository specialization, we apply SVG to a larger corpus of codebases, generating over 200,000 synthetic trajectories. We use this dataset to provide detailed analysis of scaling laws, ablations, and confounding factors for training coding agents. Overall, we believe our work will greatly accelerate research on open coding agents and showcase the advantage of open-source models that can specialize to private codebases.

While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while PP can improve classification in socially-sensitive tasks, it often comes at the cost of rationale quality and fails to mitigate underlying biases, urging caution in its application.",

    "summary": "We introduce k-NLPmeans and k-LLMmeans, text-clustering variants of k-means that periodically replace numeric centroids with textual summaries. The key idea, summary-as-centroid, retains k-means assignments in embedding space while producing human-readable, auditable cluster prototypes. The method is LLM-optional: k-NLPmeans uses lightweight, deterministic summarizers, enabling offline, low-cost, and stable operation; k-LLMmeans is a drop-in upgrade that uses an LLM for summaries under a fixed per-iteration budget whose cost does not grow with dataset size. We also present a mini-batch extension for real-time clustering of streaming text. Across diverse datasets, embedding models, and summarization strategies, our approach consistently outperforms classical baselines and approaches the accuracy of recent LLM-based clustering-without extensive LLM calls. Finally, we provide a case study on sequential text streams and release a StackExchange-derived benchmark for evaluating streaming text clustering.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for emotional support and mental health-related interactions outside clinical settings, yet little is known about how people evaluate and relate to these systems in everyday use. We analyze 5,126 Reddit posts from 47 mental health communities describing experiential or exploratory use of AI for emotional support or therapy. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory, we develop a theory-informed annotation framework and apply a hybrid LLM-human pipeline to analyze evaluative language, adoption-related attitudes, and relational alignment at scale. Our results show that engagement is shaped primarily by narrated outcomes, trust, and response quality, rather than emotional bond alone. Positive sentiment is most strongly associated with task and goal alignment, while companionship-oriented use more often involves misaligned alliances and reported risks such as dependence and symptom escalation. Overall, this work demonstrates how theory-grounded constructs can be operationalized in large-scale discourse analysis and highlights the importance of studying how users interpret language technologies in sensitive, real-world contexts.",

    "summary": "Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation in the context of fallacious argumentation.",

Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.",

Key-value (KV) caching scales linearly with context length, while external retrieval methods often return lexically similar but causally irrelevant passages.\n  We present S3-Attention, a memory-first inference-time framework that treats long-context processing as attention-aligned endogenous retrieval. S3-Attention decodes transient key and query projections into top-k sparse feature identifiers using lightweight sparse autoencoders, and constructs a CPU-based inverted index mapping features to token positions or spans during a single streaming scan. This design allows the KV cache to be discarded entirely and bounds GPU memory usage by the scan chunk size.\n  At generation time, feature co-activation is used to retrieve compact evidence spans, optionally fused with BM25 for exact lexical matching. Under a unified LongBench evaluation protocol with fixed prompting, decoding, and matched token budgets, S3-Hybrid closely matches full-context inference across multiple model families and improves robustness in several information-dense settings. We also report an engineering limitation of the current prototype, which incurs higher wall-clock latency than optimized full-KV baselines, motivating future kernel-level optimization.",

    "summary": "China's marriage registrations have declined substantially, dropping from 13.47 million couples in 2013 to 6.1 million in 2024. This study examined sentiment and moral elements underlying 219,358 marriage-related posts from Weibo and Xiaohongshu using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral elements (autonomy, community, divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo leaned toward positive sentiment, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral elements were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking autonomy and community were predominantly negative, whereas divinity-framed posts tended toward positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations contribute to negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China, offering insights for culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline.",

    "summary": "As conversational agents become increasingly common in behaviour change interventions, understanding optimal feedback delivery mechanisms becomes increasingly important. However, choosing a style that both lessens psychological reactance (perceived threats to freedom) while simultaneously eliciting feelings of surprise and engagement represents a complex design problem. We explored how three different feedback styles: 'Direct', 'Politeness', and 'Verbal Leakage' (slips or disfluencies to reveal a desired behaviour) affect user perceptions and behavioural intentions. Matching expectations from literature, the 'Direct' chatbot led to lower behavioural intentions and higher reactance, while the 'Politeness' chatbot evoked higher behavioural intentions and lower reactance. However, 'Politeness' was also seen as unsurprising and unengaging by participants. In contrast, 'Verbal Leakage' evoked reactance, yet also elicited higher feelings of surprise, engagement, and humour. These findings highlight that effective feedback requires navigating trade-offs between user reactance and engagement, with novel approaches such as 'Verbal Leakage' offering promising alternative design opportunities.",

    "summary": "Modern deep learning models often achieve high overall performance, but consistently fail on specific subgroups. Group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) addresses this problem by minimizing the worst-group loss, but it fails when group losses misrepresent performance differences between groups. This is common in domains like speech, where the widely used connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss not only scales with input length but also varies with linguistic and acoustic properties, leading to spurious differences between group losses. We present CTC-DRO, which addresses the shortcomings of the group DRO objective by smoothing the group weight update to prevent overemphasis on consistently high-loss groups, while using input length-matched batching to mitigate CTC's scaling issues. We evaluate CTC-DRO on the task of multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) across five language sets from the diverse ML-SUPERB 2.0 benchmark. CTC-DRO consistently outperforms group DRO and CTC-based baseline models, reducing the worst-language error by up to 47.1% and the average error by up to 32.9%. CTC-DRO can be applied to ASR with minimal computational costs, and, while motivated by multilingual ASR, offers the potential for reducing group disparities in other domains with similar challenges.",

    "summary": "Automated narrative intelligence systems for social media monitoring face significant scalability challenges when processing continuous data streams using traditional batch clustering algorithms. We investigate the replacement of HDBSCAN (offline clustering) with online (streaming/incremental) clustering methods in a production narrative report generation pipeline. The proposed system employs a three-stage architecture (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) that processes thousands of multilingual social media documents daily. While HDBSCAN excels at discovering hierarchical density-based clusters and handling noise, its batch-only nature necessitates complete retraining for each time window, resulting in memory constraints, computational inefficiency, and inability to adapt to evolving narratives in real-time. This work evaluates a bunch of online clustering algorithms across dimensions of cluster quality preservation, computational efficiency, memory footprint, and integration compatibility with existing workflows. We propose evaluation criteria that balance traditional clustering metrics (Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index) with narrative metrics (narrative distinctness, contingency and variance). Our methodology includes sliding-window simulations on historical datasets from Ukraine information space, enabling comparative analysis of algorithmic trade-offs in realistic operational contexts. This research addresses a critical gap between batch-oriented topic modeling frameworks and the streaming nature of social media monitoring, with implications for computational social science, crisis informatics, and narrative surveillance systems.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, yet their potential for software protection remains largely untapped. Reverse engineering continues to threaten software security, while traditional virtual machine protection (VMP) relies on rigid, rule-based transformations that are costly to design and vulnerable to automated analysis. In this work, we present the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our approach builds large-scale paired datasets of source code and normalized VM implementations, and introduces hierarchical dependency modeling at intra-, preceding-, and inter-instruction levels. We jointly optimize language modeling with functionality-aware and protection-aware contrastive objectives to capture both semantic equivalence and protection strength. To further assess resilience, we propose a protection effectiveness optimization task that quantifies and ranks different VM variants derived from the same source. Coupled with a two-stage continual pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, our method enables models to generate, compare, and reason over protected code. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves robustness across diverse protection levels, opening a new research direction for learning-based software defense. In this work, we present ShieldedCode, the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our method achieves 26.95% Pass@1 on L0 VM code generation compared to 22.58% for GPT-4o., and improves binary similarity detection Recall@1 by 10% over state of art methods like jTrans.",

But does cultural commonsense hold uniformly within a nation, or does it vary at the sub-national level? We introduce Indica, the first benchmark designed to test LLMs' ability to address this question, focusing on India - a nation of 28 states, 8 union territories, and 22 official languages. We collect human-annotated answers from five Indian regions (North, South, East, West, and Central) across 515 questions spanning 8 domains of everyday life, yielding 1,630 region-specific question-answer pairs. Strikingly, only 39.4% of questions elicit agreement across all five regions, demonstrating that cultural commonsense in India is predominantly regional, not national. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs and find two critical gaps: models achieve only 13.4%-20.9% accuracy on region-specific questions, and they exhibit geographic bias, over-selecting Central and North India as the \"default\" (selected 30-40% more often than expected) while under-representing East and West. Beyond India, our methodology provides a generalizable framework for evaluating cultural commonsense in any culturally heterogeneous nation, from question design grounded in anthropological taxonomy, to regional data collection, to bias measurement.",

While multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has shown promise in enhancing VQA systems by providing more evidence on both image and text sides, the default procedure that addresses VQA queries, especially the knowledge-intensive ones, often relies on multi-stage pipelines of mRAG with inherent dependencies. To mitigate the inefficiency limitations while maintaining VQA task performance, this paper proposes a method that trains a multimodal planning agent, dynamically decomposing the mRAG pipeline to solve the VQA task. Our method optimizes the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness by training the agent to intelligently determine the necessity of each mRAG step. In our experiments, the agent can help reduce redundant computations, cutting search time by over 60\\% compared to existing methods and decreasing costly tool calls. Meanwhile, experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, including a Deep Research agent and a carefully designed prompt-based method, on average over six various datasets.

    "summary": "While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning in structured domains like mathematics and programming, its application to general-domain reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of verifiable reward signals. To this end, methods like Reinforcement Learning with Reference Probability Reward (RLPR) have emerged, leveraging the probability of generating the final answer as a reward signal. However, these outcome-focused approaches neglect crucial step-by-step supervision of the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we introduce Probabilistic Process Supervision (P2S), a novel self-supervision framework that provides fine-grained process rewards without requiring a separate reward model or human-annotated reasoning steps. During reinforcement learning, P2S synthesizes and filters a high-quality reference reasoning chain (gold-CoT). The core of our method is to calculate a Path Faithfulness Reward (PFR) for each reasoning step, which is derived from the conditional probability of generating the gold-CoT's suffix, given the model's current reasoning prefix. Crucially, this PFR can be flexibly integrated with any outcome-based reward, directly tackling the reward sparsity problem by providing dense guidance. Extensive experiments on reading comprehension and medical Question Answering benchmarks show that P2S significantly outperforms strong baselines.",

    "summary": "Instruction tuning is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks and commonly relies on large, diverse corpora. However, small, high-quality subsets, known as coresets, can deliver comparable or superior results, though curating them remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on coarse, sample-level signals like gradients, an approach that is computationally expensive and overlooks fine-grained features. To address this, we introduce TRIM (Token Relevance via Interpretable Multi-layer Attention), a forward-only, token-centric framework. Instead of using gradients, TRIM operates by matching underlying representational patterns identified via attention-based \"fingerprints\" from a handful of target samples. Such an approach makes TRIM highly efficient and uniquely sensitive to the structural features that define a task. Coresets selected by our method consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines by up to 9% on downstream tasks and even surpass the performance of full-data fine-tuning in some settings. By avoiding expensive backward passes, TRIM achieves this at a fraction of the computational cost. These findings establish TRIM as a scalable and efficient alternative for building high-quality instruction-tuning datasets.",

    "title": "NurValues: Real-World Nursing Values Evaluation for Large Language Models in Clinical Context",
    "summary": "While LLMs have demonstrated medical knowledge and conversational ability, their deployment in clinical practice raises new risks: patients may place greater trust in LLM-generated responses than in nurses' professional judgments, potentially intensifying nurse-patient conflicts. Such risks highlight the urgent need of evaluating whether LLMs align with the core nursing values upheld by human nurses. This work introduces the first benchmark for nursing value alignment, consisting of five core value dimensions distilled from international nursing codes: Altruism, Human Dignity, Integrity, Justice, and Professionalism. We define two-level tasks on the benchmark, considering the two characteristics of emerging nurse-patient conflicts. The Easy-Level dataset consists of 2,200 value-aligned and value-violating instances, which are collected through a five-month longitudinal field study across three hospitals of varying tiers; The Hard-Level dataset is comprised of 2,200 dialogue-based instances that embed contextual cues and subtle misleading signals, which increase adversarial complexity and better reflect the subjectivity and bias of narrators in the context of emerging nurse-patient conflicts. We evaluate a total of 23 SoTA LLMs on their ability to align with nursing values, and find that general LLMs outperform medical ones, and Justice is the hardest value dimension. As the first real-world benchmark for healthcare value alignment, NurValues provides novel insights into how LLMs navigate ethical challenges in clinician-patient interactions.",

    "summary": "The capacity of AI agents to effectively handle tasks of increasing duration and complexity continues to grow, demonstrating exceptional performance in coding, deep research, and complex problem-solving evaluations. However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.",

Focusing on Persian (Farsi) as a historically contact-rich language, we probe the representations of a Persian-trained model when exposed to languages with varying degrees and types of contact with Persian. Our methodology quantifies the amount of linguistic information encoded in intermediate representations and assesses how this information is distributed across model components for different morphosyntactic features. The results show that universal syntactic information is largely insensitive to historical contact, whereas morphological features such as Case and Gender are strongly shaped by language-specific structure, suggesting that contact effects in monolingual language models are selective and structurally constrained.",

    "summary": "Spontaneous symmetry breaking in statistical mechanics primarily occurs during phase transitions at the thermodynamic limit where the Hamiltonian preserves inversion symmetry, yet the low-temperature free energy exhibits reduced symmetry. Herein, we demonstrate the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in natural language processing (NLP) models during both pre-training and fine-tuning, even under deterministic dynamics and within a finite training architecture. This phenomenon occurs at the level of individual attention heads and is scaled-down to its small subset of nodes and also valid at a single-nodal level, where nodes acquire the capacity to learn a limited set of tokens after pre-training or labels after fine-tuning for a specific classification task. As the number of nodes increases, a crossover in learning ability occurs, governed by the tradeoff between a decrease following random-guess among increased possible outputs, and enhancement following nodal cooperation, which exceeds the sum of individual nodal capabilities. In contrast to spin-glass systems, where a microscopic state of frozen spins cannot be directly linked to the free-energy minimization goal, each nodal function in this framework contributes explicitly to the global network task and can be upper-bounded using convex hull analysis. Results are demonstrated using BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel classification task.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in verbal creative tasks. However, previous assessments of the creative capabilities of LLMs remain weakly grounded in human creativity theory and are thus hard to interpret. The widely used Divergent Association Task (DAT) focuses on novelty, ignoring appropriateness, a core component of creativity. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs on DAT and show that their scores on the task are lower than those of two baselines that do not possess any creative abilities, undermining its validity for model evaluation. Grounded in human creativity theory, which defines creativity as the combination of novelty and appropriateness, we introduce Conditional Divergent Association Task (CDAT). CDAT evaluates novelty conditional on contextual appropriateness, separating noise from creativity better than DAT, while remaining simple and objective. Under CDAT, smaller model families often show the most creativity, whereas advanced families favor appropriateness at lower novelty. We hypothesize that training and alignment likely shift models along this frontier, making outputs more appropriate but less creative. We release the dataset and code.",

Such library hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting. Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate seven diverse LLMs across two hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to 99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.",

We propose JEPA-Reasoner, a novel architectural paradigm that decouples these tasks using a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) for pure latent-space reasoning and a separate Talker module for linguistic reconstruction. By isolating the reasoning engine from the discrete token-sampling process, our architecture enables: (1) Error Containment, where token-level failures cannot propagate into the latent reasoning chain; (2) Continuous Guidance, providing the generator with access to the entire lossless reasoning trajectory; and (3) Representation of Uncertainty, allowing the model to maintain multiple hypotheses via mixed latent vectors. Controlled experiments on synthetic and natural language tasks demonstrate that this decoupling enables a 0.9B model to achieve a 149.5\\% improvement in 8-shot GSM8K accuracy over a coupled Transformer baseline trained on identical data. This work shifts the focus from scaling coupled models to investigating decoupled architectures as a more robust foundation for complex reasoning.",

    "summary": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has found a widespread use in computing education; at the same time, quality of generated materials raises concerns among educators and students. This study addresses this issue by introducing a novel method for diagram code generation with in-context examples based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), which aims to improve diagram generation by aligning models' output with user expectations. Our approach is evaluated by computer science educators, who assessed 150 diagrams generated with large language models (LLMs) for logical organization, connectivity, layout aesthetic, and AI hallucination. The assessment dataset is additionally investigated for its utility in automated diagram evaluation. The preliminary results suggest that our method decreases the rate of factual hallucination and improves diagram faithfulness to provided context; however, due to LLMs' stochasticity, the quality of the generated diagrams varies. Additionally, we present an in-depth analysis and discussion on the connection between AI hallucination and the quality of generated diagrams, which reveals that text contexts of higher complexity lead to higher rates of hallucination and LLMs often fail to detect mistakes in their output.",

Inspired by cognitive memory systems, BMAM decomposes memory into episodic, semantic, salience-aware, and control-oriented components that operate at complementary time scales. To support long-horizon reasoning, BMAM organizes episodic memories along explicit timelines and retrieves evidence by fusing multiple complementary signals.

    "summary": "The prevalence of sarcasm in multimodal dialogues on the social platforms presents a crucial yet challenging task for understanding the true intent behind online content. Comprehensive sarcasm analysis requires two key aspects: Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD) and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE). Intuitively, the act of detection is the result of the reasoning process that explains the sarcasm. Current research predominantly focuses on addressing either MSD or MuSE as a single task. Even though some recent work has attempted to integrate these tasks, their inherent causal dependency is often overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose MuVaC, a variational causal inference framework that mimics human cognitive mechanisms for understanding sarcasm, enabling robust multimodal feature learning to jointly optimize MSD and MuSE. Specifically, we first model MSD and MuSE from the perspective of structural causal models, establishing variational causal pathways to define the objectives for joint optimization. Next, we design an alignment-then-fusion approach to integrate multimodal features, providing robust fusion representations for sarcasm detection and explanation generation. Finally, we enhance the reasoning trustworthiness by ensuring consistency between detection results and explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MuVaC in public datasets, offering a new perspective for understanding multimodal sarcasm.",

Parliamentary speeches address a wide range of topics, some of which evoke stronger emotions than others. While everyone has intuitive assumptions about what the most emotive topics in a parliament may be, there has been little research into the emotions typically linked to different topics. This paper strives to fill this gap by examining emotion expression among the topics of parliamentary speeches delivered in Eduskunta, the Finnish Parliament, between 2000 and 2020. An emotion analysis model is used to investigate emotion expression in topics, from both synchronic and diachronic perspectives. The results strengthen evidence of increasing positivity in parliamentary speech and provide further insights into topic-specific emotion expression within parliamentary debate.",

Our model is first pretrained without the LLM on inexpensive hardware, and then efficiently attached to the target LLM via a brief 1K-step instruction tuning (IT) stage. Through experiments on speech translation and spoken question answering, we demonstrate the versatility of SpeechMapper's pretrained block, presenting results for both task-agnostic IT, an ASR-based adaptation strategy that does not train in the target task, and task-specific IT. In task-agnostic settings, Speechmapper rivals the best instruction-following speech LLM from IWSLT25, despite never being trained on these tasks, while in task-specific settings, it outperforms this model across many datasets, despite requiring less data and compute. Overall, SpeechMapper offers a practical and scalable approach for efficient, generalizable speech-LLM integration without large-scale IT.",

However, current benchmarks primarily report final accuracy, revealing what models can do but obscuring the cognitive bottlenecks that define their true capability boundaries. To move from simple performance scoring to a diagnostic tool, we introduce a framework grounded in Cognitive Load Theory. Our framework deconstructs task complexity into two quantifiable components: Intrinsic Load, the inherent structural complexity of the solution path, formalized with a novel Tool Interaction Graph; and Extraneous Load, the difficulty arising from ambiguous task presentation. To enable controlled experiments, we construct ToolLoad-Bench, the first benchmark with parametrically adjustable cognitive load. Our evaluation reveals distinct performance cliffs as cognitive load increases, allowing us to precisely map each model's capability boundary. We validate that our framework's predictions are highly calibrated with empirical results, establishing a principled methodology for understanding an agent's limits and a practical foundation for building more efficient systems.",

    "summary": "Detecting harmful memes is crucial for safeguarding the integrity and harmony of online environments, yet existing detection methods are often resource-intensive, inflexible, and lacking explainability, limiting their applicability in assisting real-world web content moderation. We propose U-CoT+, a resource-efficient framework that prioritizes accessibility, flexibility and transparency in harmful meme detection by fully harnessing the capabilities of lightweight unimodal large language models (LLMs). Instead of directly prompting or fine-tuning large multimodal models (LMMs) as black-box classifiers, we avoid immediate reasoning over complex visual inputs but decouple meme content recognition from meme harmfulness analysis through a high-fidelity meme-to-text pipeline, which collaborates lightweight LMMs and LLMs to convert multimodal memes into natural language descriptions that preserve critical visual information, thus enabling text-only LLMs to \"see\" memes by \"reading\". Grounded in textual inputs, we further guide unimodal LLMs' reasoning under zero-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) prompting with targeted, interpretable, context-aware, and easily obtained human-crafted guidelines, thus providing accountable step-by-step rationales, while enabling flexible and efficient adaptation to diverse sociocultural criteria of harmfulness. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that U-CoT+ achieves performance comparable to resource-intensive baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and potential as a scalable, explainable, and low-resource solution to support harmful meme detection.",

    "summary": "Speculative decoding (SD) has proven effective for accelerating LLM inference by quickly generating draft tokens and verifying them in parallel. However, SD remains largely unexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which extend LLMs to process both image and text prompts. To address this gap, we benchmark existing inference methods with small draft models on 11 datasets across diverse input scenarios and observe scenario-specific performance fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing. With its plug-and-play compatibility, we further enhance TABED by integrating advanced verification and alternative drafting methods.

    "summary": "Recently, advanced large language models (LLMs) have emerged at an increasingly rapid pace. However, when faced with complex problems, most users are often unable to provide accurate and effective prompts to interact with LLMs, thus limiting the performance of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose Prompt-R1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that uses a small-scale LLM to collaborate with large-scale LLMs, replacing user interaction to solve problems better. This collaboration is cast as a multi-turn prompt interaction, where the small-scale LLM thinks and generates prompts, and the large-scale LLM performs complex reasoning. A dual-constrained reward is designed to optimize for correctness, generation quality, and reasoning accuracy. Prompt-R1 provides a plug-and-play framework that supports both inference and training with various large-scale LLMs. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that Prompt-R1 significantly outperforms baseline models across tasks.

    "summary": "Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce \\underline{\\textbf{A}}daptive \\textbf{\\underline{I}}ntent-driven \\textbf{\\underline{P}}reference \\textbf{\\underline{O}}ptimization (\\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of $λ\\,Δ\\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.\n  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess real-world and adversarial preference alignment.\n  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6 Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.",

    "summary": "While large language models show promise in mental healthcare, evaluating their therapeutic competence remains challenging due to the unstructured and longitudinal nature of counseling. We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.",

Compared with traditional methods, the recent LLM-as-a-Judge paradigms enable better and more flexible evaluation, and show promise as generative reward models for reinforcement learning. However, prior work has revealed a notable gap between their seemingly impressive benchmark performance and actual effectiveness in RL practice. We attribute this issue to some limitations in existing studies, including the dominance of pairwise evaluation and inadequate optimization of evaluation criteria. Therefore, we propose CE-RM-4B, a pointwise generative reward model trained with a dedicated two-stage rollout method, and adopting unified query-based criteria. Using only about 5.7K high-quality data curated from the open-source preference dataset, our CE-RM-4B achieves superior performance on diverse reward model benchmarks, especially in Best-of-N scenarios, and delivers more effective improvements in downstream RL practice.",

    "summary": "Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual evidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly critical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise grounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because they map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without intermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that hallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual input. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that quantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines feature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is masked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences between clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a sentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure of visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks (PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our results show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across datasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond these quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded tokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when combined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it further improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights why gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together, our findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for diagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust hallucination detection in multimodal generation.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a structure-aware decoding method based on large language models to address the difficulty of traditional approaches in maintaining both semantic integrity and structural consistency in nested and overlapping entity extraction tasks. The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.",

    "summary": "Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions, advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics, degrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for effective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment. This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate alignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods. Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.",

SAPO adaptively and efficiently introduces process supervision signals by actively minimizing the reasoner-verifier gap rather than relying on inefficient MC estimations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms most existing self-evolution methods on two challenging task types: mathematics and code. Additionally, to further investigate SAPO's impact on verifier performance, this work introduces two new benchmarks for process reward models in both mathematical and coding tasks.",

The present project introduces a method of deriving confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order statistics. Having confidence intervals provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the boundary placement, facilitating tasks like finding boundaries that should be reviewed. As a bonus, on the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a slight overall improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals can be emitted during the alignment process as JSON files and a main table for programmatic and statistical analysis. For familiarity, they are also output as Praat TextGrids using a point tier to represent the intervals.",

Meanwhile, multi-agent systems consume substantial tokens and inevitably dilute the primary problem, which is particularly problematic in business workflow tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Cochain, a collaboration prompting framework that effectively solves the business workflow collaboration problem by combining knowledge and prompts at a reduced cost. Specifically, we construct an integrated knowledge graph that incorporates knowledge from multiple stages. Furthermore, by maintaining and retrieving a prompts tree, we can obtain prompt information relevant to other stages of the business workflow. We perform extensive evaluations of Cochain across multiple datasets, demonstrating that Cochain outperforms all baselines in both prompt engineering and multi-agent LLMs. Additionally, expert evaluation results indicate that the use of a small model in combination with Cochain outperforms GPT-4.",

    "summary": "The ability to generate SPARQL queries from natural language questions is crucial for ensuring efficient and accurate retrieval of structured data from knowledge graphs (KG). While large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for SPARQL query generation, they are often susceptible to hallucinations and out-of-distribution errors when generating KG elements, such as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), based on opaque internal parametric knowledge. We propose PGMR (Post-Generation Memory Retrieval), a modular framework where the LLM produces an intermediate query using natural language placeholders for URIs, and a non-parametric memory module is subsequently employed to retrieve and resolve the correct KG URIs. PGMR significantly enhances query correctness (SQM) across various LLMs, datasets, and distribution shifts, while achieving the near-complete suppression of URI hallucinations. Critically, we demonstrate PGMR's superior safety and robustness: a retrieval confidence threshold enables PGMR to effectively refuse to answer queries that lack support, and the retriever proves highly resilient to memory noise, maintaining strong performance even when the non-parametric memory size is scaled up to 9 times with irrelevant, distracting entities.",

One of the most widely used tools in the current field is Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) that originally was developed to analyze English texts and translated into multiple languages.

The suggested approach comprises 96 categories, integrating syntactic, morphological, lexical, general statistical features, and results of predictions obtained using pre-trained language models (LMs) for text analysis. Rather than applying direct translation to existing thesauri, we built the dictionary specifically for the Russian language based on the content from several lexicographic resources, semantic dictionaries and corpora.

To address the gap, we introduce ColorConceptBench, a new human-annotated benchmark to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through the lens of probabilistic color distributions. ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance). This demonstrates that achieving human-like color semantics requires more than larger models, but demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.",

    "summary": "SWE-bench has emerged as the premier benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on complex software engineering tasks. While these capabilities are fundamentally acquired during the mid-training phase and subsequently elicited during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), there remains a critical deficit in metrics capable of guiding mid-training effectively. Standard metrics such as Perplexity (PPL) are compromised by the \"Long-Context Tax\" and exhibit weak correlation with downstream SWE performance. In this paper, we bridge this gap by first introducing a rigorous data filtering strategy. Crucially, we propose the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, redefining intelligence not by scalar Top-1 compression, but by the capacity to structure uncertainty into Entropy-Compressed States of low orders (\"reasonable hesitation\"). Grounded in this fine-grained entropy analysis, we formulate a novel metric, HE-SNR (High-Entropy Signal-to-Noise Ratio). Validated on industrial-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models across varying context windows (32K/128K), our approach demonstrates superior robustness and predictive power. This work provides both the theoretical foundation and practical tools for optimizing the latent potential of LLMs in complex engineering domains.",

Recent approaches leverage generative models, such as diffusion models, to provide additional supervision, but face a trade-off between generalization and fidelity: fine-tuning diffusion models for artifact removal improves fidelity but risks overfitting, while fine-tuning-free methods preserve generalization but often yield lower fidelity. We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models. We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models. Furthermore, we take a closer look at the guidance signal for 2D refinement and propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify uncertain regions for targeted improvement. Experiments across multiple datasets show that FreeFix improves multi-frame consistency and achieves performance comparable to or surpassing fine-tuning-based methods, while retaining strong generalization ability.",

Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) addresses this challenge by enabling learning systems to continuously learn new classes while preserving prior knowledge.

However, existing CLIP-based CIL methods are often scattered across disparate codebases, rely on inconsistent configurations, hindering fair comparisons, reproducibility, and practical adoption. Therefore, we propose C3Box (CLIP-based Class-inCremental learning toolBOX), a modular and comprehensive Python toolbox. C3Box integrates representative traditional CIL methods, ViT-based CIL methods, and state-of-the-art CLIP-based CIL methods into a unified CLIP-based framework. By inheriting the streamlined design of PyCIL, C3Box provides a JSON-based configuration and standardized execution pipeline. This design enables reproducible experimentation with low engineering overhead and makes C3Box a reliable benchmark platform for continual learning research. Designed to be user-friendly, C3Box relies only on widely used open-source libraries and supports major operating systems. The code is available at https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/C3Box.",

The core challenge lies in optimally assigning rich general attributes to 3D primitives while addressing the inconsistency issues from multi-view images. We present a unified, kernel- and feature-agnostic formulation of the feature lifting problem as a sparse linear inverse problem, which can be solved efficiently in closed form. Our approach admits a provable upper bound on the global optimal error under convex losses for delivering high quality lifted features. To address inconsistencies and noise in multi-view observations, we introduce two complementary regularization strategies to stabilize the solution and enhance semantic fidelity. Tikhonov Guidance enforces numerical stability through soft diagonal dominance, while Post-Lifting Aggregation filters noisy inputs via feature clustering.

However, incorporating vision data significantly increases the prompt length, resulting in a longer time to first token (TTFT). This bottleneck can be alleviated by leveraging the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. Analyzing these attention patterns in VLMs when processing a series of images, we observe the absence of inter-image attention in a substantial portion of layers. Based on this, we propose BlindSight: an approach to optimize multi-image VLM inference using an input-template-aware attention sparsity mask with no runtime overhead. We utilize a dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic categorization for attention heads: Dense, Sink, Intra-Image, and Intra-Image+Sink. We develop a Triton-based GPU kernel to leverage this sparsity. BlindSight achieves a 1.8-3.2x speedup in the attention computation (prompt length 36K-300K). BlindSight generalizes across VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, Gemma 3), with only a 0.78% absolute accuracy degradation on average on multi-image comprehension benchmarks. Finally, we advocate for the design of efficient VLMs that combine BlindSight-inspired sparse and dense layers.",

    "summary": "Caribou across the Arctic has declined in recent decades, motivating scalable and accurate monitoring approaches to guide evidence-based conservation actions and policy decisions. Manual interpretation from this imagery is labor-intensive and error-prone, underscoring the need for automatic and reliable detection across varying scenes. Yet, such automatic detection is challenging due to severe background heterogeneity, dominant empty terrain (class imbalance), small or occluded targets, and wide variation in density and scale. To make the detection model (HerdNet) more robust to these challenges, a weakly supervised patch-level pretraining based on a detection network's architecture is proposed. The detection dataset includes five caribou herds distributed across Alaska. By learning from empty vs. non-empty labels in this dataset, the approach produces early weakly supervised knowledge for enhanced detection compared to HerdNet, which is initialized from generic weights. Accordingly, the patch-based pretrain network attained high accuracy on multi-herd imagery (2017) and on an independent year's (2019) test sets (F1: 93.7%/92.6%, respectively), enabling reliable mapping of regions containing animals to facilitate manual counting on large aerial imagery. Transferred to detection, initialization from weakly supervised pretraining yielded consistent gains over ImageNet weights on both positive patches (F1: 92.6%/93.5% vs. 89.3%/88.6%), and full-image counting (F1: 95.5%/93.3% vs. 91.5%/90.4%). Remaining limitations are false positives from animal-like background clutter and false negatives related to low animal density occlusions. Overall, pretraining on coarse labels prior to detection makes it possible to rely on weakly-supervised pretrained weights even when labeled data are limited, achieving results comparable to generic-weight initialization.",

    "summary": "Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of talking head generation (THG). However, slow inference speeds and prevalent non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, a pioneering diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through a spatiotemporal variational autoencoder with a high compression ratio. Additionally, to enable semi-autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles into key-value caching for maintaining identity consistency and temporal coherence during long-term streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation and enhance temporal consistency in streaming generation, leveraging a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the streaming student. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, achieving a breakthrough in efficiency for applications requiring real-time THG. Experimental results demonstrate that REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance.",

    "title": "DiffRatio: Training One-Step Diffusion Models Without Teacher Supervision",
    "summary": "Score-based distillation methods (e.g., variational score distillation) train one-step diffusion models by first pre-training a teacher score model and then distilling it into a one-step student model. However, the gradient estimator in the distillation stage usually suffers from two sources of bias: (1) biased teacher supervision due to score estimation error incurred during pre-training, and (2) the student model's score estimation error during distillation. These biases can degrade the quality of the resulting one-step diffusion model. To address this, we propose DiffRatio, a new framework for training one-step diffusion models: instead of estimating the teacher and student scores independently and then taking their difference, we directly estimate the score difference as the gradient of a learned log density ratio between the student and data distributions across diffusion time steps. This approach greatly simplifies the training pipeline, significantly reduces gradient estimation bias, and improves one-step generation quality. Additionally, it also reduces auxiliary network size by using a lightweight density-ratio network instead of two full score networks, which improves computational and memory efficiency. DiffRatio achieves competitive one-step generation results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet (64x64 and 512x512), outperforming most teacher-supervised distillation methods. Moreover, the learned density ratio naturally serves as a verifier, enabling a principled inference-time parallel scaling scheme that further improves the generation quality without external rewards or additional sequential computation.",

Starting from simple user prompts, TIPO leverages a lightweight pre-trained model to expand these prompts into richer and more detailed versions. Conceptually, TIPO samples refined prompts from a targeted sub-distribution within the broader semantic space, preserving the original intent while significantly improving visual quality, coherence, and detail. Unlike resource-intensive methods based on large language models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO offers strong computational efficiency and scalability, opening new possibilities for effective automated prompt engineering in T2I tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that TIPO achieves stronger text alignment, reduced visual artifacts, and consistently higher human preference rates, while maintaining competitive aesthetic quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of distribution-aligned prompt engineering and point toward broader opportunities for scalable, automated refinement in text-to-image generation.",

    "summary": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for surgical quality assessment promise to democratize access to expertise, with applications in training, guidance, and accreditation. This study presents the SAGES Critical View of Safety (CVS) Challenge, the first AI competition organized by a surgical society, using the CVS in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a universally recommended yet inconsistently performed safety step, as an exemplar of surgical quality assessment. A global collaboration across 54 institutions in 24 countries engaged hundreds of clinicians and engineers to curate 1,000 videos annotated by 20 surgical experts according to a consensus-validated protocol. The challenge addressed key barriers to real-world deployment in surgery, including achieving high performance, capturing uncertainty in subjective assessment, and ensuring robustness to clinical variability. To enable this scale of effort, we developed EndoGlacier, a framework for managing large, heterogeneous surgical video and multi-annotator workflows. Thirteen international teams participated, achieving up to a 17% relative gain in assessment performance, over 80% reduction in calibration error, and a 17% relative improvement in robustness over the state-of-the-art. Analysis of results highlighted methodological trends linked to model performance, providing guidance for future research toward robust, clinically deployable AI for surgical quality assessment.",

    "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain: diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient, leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360 and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality while substantially reducing training time.",

Transformer-based models with self-supervised pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution (ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of 18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs, consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.",

For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.",

We find existing methods fail to maintain stable grounding as GUI distributions shift over time, due to the diversity of UI interaction points and regions in fluxing scenarios. To address this, we introduce GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework that stabilizes continual learning through two novel rewards: Anchoring Point Reward in Flux (APR-iF) and Anchoring Region Reward in Flux (ARR-iF). These rewards guide the agents to align with shifting interaction points and regions, mitigating the tendency of existing reward strategies to over-adapt to static grounding cues (e.g., fixed coordinates or element scales). Extensive experiments show GUI-AiF surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. Our work establishes the first continual learning framework for GUI agents, revealing the untapped potential of reinforcement fine-tuning for continual GUI Agents.",

Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction.",

    "summary": "The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency. Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5% higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while requiring only 1% of the computational time.",

    "summary": "The ability of the deep learning model to recognize when a sample falls outside its learned distribution is critical for safe and reliable deployment. Recent state-of-the-art out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods leverage activation shaping to improve the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD inputs. These approaches resort to sample-specific scaling but apply a static percentile threshold across all samples regardless of their nature, resulting in suboptimal ID-OOD separability. In this work, we propose \\textbf{AdaSCALE}, an adaptive scaling procedure that dynamically adjusts the percentile threshold based on a sample's estimated OOD likelihood. This estimation leverages our key observation: OOD samples exhibit significantly more pronounced activation shifts at high-magnitude activations under minor perturbation compared to ID samples. AdaSCALE enables stronger scaling for likely ID samples and weaker scaling for likely OOD samples, yielding highly separable energy scores. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance, outperforming the latest rival OptFS by 14.94% in near-OOD and 21.67% in far-OOD datasets in average FPR@95 metric on the ImageNet-1k benchmark across eight diverse architectures.

However, many existing self-supervised blind-spot denoising methods suffer from training inefficiencies and suboptimal performance due to restricted receptive fields. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Progressive $\\mathcal{J}$-invariant Learning that maximizes the use of $\\mathcal{J}$-invariant to enhance LDCT denoising performance. We introduce a step-wise blind-spot denoising mechanism that enforces conditional independence in a progressive manner, enabling more fine-grained learning for denoising. Furthermore, we explicitly inject a combination of controlled Gaussian and Poisson noise during training to regularize the denoising process and mitigate overfitting. Extensive experiments on the Mayo LDCT dataset demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised approaches and achieves performance comparable to, or better than, several representative supervised denoising methods.",

    "title": "bi-modal textual prompt learning for vision-language models in remote sensing",
    "summary": "Prompt learning (PL) has emerged as an effective strategy to adapt vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for downstream tasks under limited supervision. While PL has demonstrated strong generalization on natural image datasets, its transferability to remote sensing (RS) imagery remains underexplored. RS data present unique challenges, including multi-label scenes, high intra-class variability, and diverse spatial resolutions, that hinder the direct applicability of existing PL methods. In particular, current prompt-based approaches often struggle to identify dominant semantic cues and fail to generalize to novel classes in RS scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose BiMoRS, a lightweight bi-modal prompt learning framework tailored for RS tasks. BiMoRS employs a frozen image captioning model (e.g., BLIP-2) to extract textual semantic summaries from RS images. These captions are tokenized using a BERT tokenizer and fused with high-level visual features from the CLIP encoder. A lightweight cross-attention module then conditions a learnable query prompt on the fused textual-visual representation, yielding contextualized prompts without altering the CLIP backbone. We evaluate BiMoRS on four RS datasets across three domain generalization (DG) tasks and observe consistent performance gains, outperforming strong baselines by up to 2% on average.

This paper presents a systolic array architecture incorporating novel exact and approximate processing elements (PEs), designed using energy-efficient positive partial product and negative partial product cells, termed as PPC and NPPC, respectively. The proposed 8-bit exact and approximate PE designs are employed in a 8x8 systolic array, which achieves a energy savings of 22% and 32%, respectively, compared to the existing design. To demonstrate their effectiveness, the proposed PEs are integrated into a systolic array (SA) for Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) computation, achieving high output quality with a PSNR of 38.21,dB. Furthermore, in an edge detection application using convolution, the approximate PE achieves a PSNR of 30.45,dB.

    "summary": "Skill assessment in procedural videos is crucial for the objective evaluation of human performance in settings such as manufacturing and procedural daily tasks. Current research on skill assessment has predominantly focused on sports and lacks large-scale datasets for complex procedural activities. Existing studies typically involve only a limited number of actions, focus on either pairwise assessments (e.g., A is better than B) or on binary labels (e.g., good execution vs needs improvement). In response to these shortcomings, we introduce ProSkill, the first benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural tasks. ProSkill provides absolute skill assessment annotations, along with pairwise ones. This is enabled by a novel and scalable annotation protocol that allows for the creation of an absolute skill assessment ranking starting from pairwise assessments. This protocol leverages a Swiss Tournament scheme for efficient pairwise comparisons, which are then aggregated into consistent, continuous global scores using an ELO-based rating system. We use our dataset to benchmark the main state-of-the-art skill assessment algorithms, including both ranking-based and pairwise paradigms. The suboptimal results achieved by the current state-of-the-art highlight the challenges and thus the value of ProSkill in the context of skill assessment for procedural videos.

    "summary": "Face morphing attacks present a significant threat to face recognition systems used in electronic identity enrolment and border control, particularly in single-image morphing attack detection (S-MAD) scenarios where no trusted reference is available. In spite of the vast amount of research on this problem, morph detection systems struggle in cross-dataset scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce a region-aware frequency-based morph detection strategy that drastically improves over strong baseline methods in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings using a lightweight approach. Having observed the separability of bona fide and morph samples in the frequency domain of different facial parts, our approach 1) introduces the concept of residual frequency domain, where the frequency of the signal is decoupled from the natural spectral decay to easily discriminate between morph and bona fide data; 2) additionally, we reason in a global and local manner by combining the evidence from different facial regions in a Markov Random Field, which infers a globally consistent decision. The proposed method, trained exclusively on the synthetic morphing attack detection development dataset (SMDD), is evaluated in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings on FRLL-Morph and MAD22 sets. Our approach achieves an average equal error rate (EER) of 1.85\\% on FRLL-Morph and ranks second on MAD22 with an average EER of 6.12\\%, while also obtaining a good bona fide presentation classification error rate (BPCER) at a low attack presentation classification error rate (APCER) using only spectral features. These findings indicate that Fourier-domain residual modeling with structured regional fusion offers a competitive alternative to deep S-MAD architectures.",

Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections.

    "summary": "Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($Φ$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $Φ$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $Φ$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\\mathbfγ$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3\\text{B}\\sim14\\text{B}$, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.

    "summary": "Recent advances in large multi-modal generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multi-modal generation, including image and video generation. These models are typically built upon multi-step frameworks like diffusion and flow matching, which inherently limits their inference efficiency (requiring 40-100 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs)). While various few-step methods aim to accelerate the inference, existing solutions have clear limitations. Prominent distillation-based methods, such as progressive and consistency distillation, either require an iterative distillation procedure or show significant degradation at very few steps (< 4-NFE). Meanwhile, integrating adversarial training into distillation (e.g., DMD/DMD2 and SANA-Sprint) to enhance performance introduces training instability, added complexity, and high GPU memory overhead due to the auxiliary trained models. To this end, we propose TwinFlow, a simple yet effective framework for training 1-step generative models that bypasses the need of fixed pretrained teacher models and avoids standard adversarial networks during training, making it ideal for building large-scale, efficient models. On text-to-image tasks, our method achieves a GenEval score of 0.83 in 1-NFE, outperforming strong baselines like SANA-Sprint (a GAN loss-based framework) and RCGM (a consistency-based framework). Notably, we demonstrate the scalability of TwinFlow by full-parameter training on Qwen-Image-20B and transform it into an efficient few-step generator. With just 1-NFE, our approach matches the performance of the original 100-NFE model on both the GenEval and DPG-Bench benchmarks, reducing computational cost by $100\\times$ with minor quality degradation.

    "summary": "Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) aims to automate model design for privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) but currently faces two critical bottlenecks: unguided supernet training that yields suboptimal models, and costly multi-hour pipelines for post-training subnet discovery. We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

    "summary": "Essential to visual generation is efficient modeling of visual data priors. Conventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the conditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale prediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over multi-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency. However, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require each token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial redundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we propose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive framework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the complexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a scale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent preceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel training strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption. Furthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention of each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions on adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales, for the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements, we reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to O(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating the need for KV cache during inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that MVAR achieves comparable or superior performance with both small model trained from scratch and large fine-tuned models, while reducing the average GPU memory footprint by 3.0x.",

    "summary": "Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) is a challenging multimodal continual learning setting, where models must incrementally learn new semantic categories while maintaining accurate text-video alignment for previously learned ones, thus making it particularly prone to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge in CTVR is feature drift, which manifests in two forms: intra-modal feature drift caused by continual learning within each modality, and non-cooperative feature drift across modalities that leads to modality misalignment. To mitigate these issues, we propose StructAlign, a structured cross-modal alignment method for CTVR. First, StructAlign introduces a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry as a unified geometric prior to mitigate modality misalignment. Building upon this geometric prior, we design a cross-modal ETF alignment loss that aligns text and video features with category-level ETF prototypes, encouraging the learned representations to form an approximate simplex ETF geometry. In addition, to suppress intra-modal feature drift, we design a Cross-modal Relation Preserving loss, which leverages complementary modalities to preserve cross-modal similarity relations, providing stable relational supervision for feature updates. By jointly addressing non-cooperative feature drift across modalities and intra-modal feature drift, StructAlign effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting in CTVR. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art continual retrieval approaches.",

    "summary": "Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a pivotal technology in low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) reconnaissance missions, enabling robust target detection and tracking by integrating thermal saliency with environmental textures. However, traditional no-reference metrics (Statistics-based metrics and Gradient-based metrics) fail in complex low-light environments, termed the ``Noise Trap''. This paper mathematically prove that these metrics are positively correlated with high-frequency sensor noise, paradoxically assigning higher scores to degraded images and misguiding algorithm optimization. To address this, we propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric. Inspired by Weber's Law, TBC focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets rather than global statistics. Unlike traditional metrics, TBC penalizes background noise and rewards target visibility. Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate the superiority of TBC. Results show that TBC exhibits high ``Semantic Discriminability'' in distinguishing thermal targets from background clutter. Furthermore, TBC achieves remarkable computational efficiency, making it a reliable and real-time standard for intelligent UAV systems.",

    "summary": "Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However, existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map. Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.",

Previous Parameter-Efficient-Tuning (PET) methods regard the pre-trained model as an opaque Black Box model, relying purely on data-driven optimization and underutilizing their inherent prior knowledge. This oversight limits the models' potential for effective downstream task adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel black-whIte bOx prompT leArning framework (IOTA), which integrates a data-driven Black Box module with a knowledge-driven White Box module for downstream task adaptation. Specifically, the White Box module derives corrective knowledge by contrasting the wrong predictions with the right cognition. This knowledge is verbalized into interpretable human prompts and leveraged through a corrective knowledge-guided prompt selection strategy to guide the Black Box module toward more accurate predictions. By jointly leveraging knowledge- and data-driven learning signals, IOTA achieves effective downstream task adaptation. Experimental results on 12 image classification benchmarks under few-shot and easy-to-hard adaptation settings demonstrate the effectiveness of corrective knowledge and the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "Zero-shot anomaly detection aims to detect and localise abnormal regions in the image without access to any in-domain training images. While recent approaches leverage vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to transfer high-level concept knowledge, methods based on purely vision foundation models (VFMs), like DINOv2, have lagged behind in performance. We argue that this gap stems from two practical issues: (i) limited diversity in existing auxiliary anomaly detection datasets and (ii) overly shallow VFM adaptation strategies. To address both challenges, we propose AnomalyVFM, a general and effective framework that turns any pretrained VFM into a strong zero-shot anomaly detector. Our approach combines a robust three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme with a parameter-efficient adaptation mechanism, utilising low-rank feature adapters and a confidence-weighted pixel loss. Together, these components enable modern VFMs to substantially outperform current state-of-the-art methods. More specifically, with RADIO as a backbone, AnomalyVFM achieves an average image-level AUROC of 94.1% across 9 diverse datasets, surpassing previous methods by significant 3.3 percentage points.

    "summary": "Recent diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Models (dMLLMs) suffer from high inference latency and therefore rely on caching techniques to accelerate decoding. However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \\textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \\textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

In this work, we introduce Portrait Collection Generation (PCG), a novel task that generates coherent portrait collections by editing a reference portrait image through natural language instructions. This task poses two unique challenges to existing methods: (1) complex multi-attribute modifications such as pose, spatial layout, and camera viewpoint; and (2) high-fidelity detail preservation including identity, clothing, and accessories. To address these challenges, we propose CHEESE, the first large-scale PCG dataset containing 24K portrait collections and 573K samples with high-quality modification text annotations, constructed through an Large Vison-Language Model-based pipeline with inversion-based verification. We further propose SCheese, a framework that combines text-guided generation with hierarchical identity and detail preservation. SCheese employs adaptive feature fusion mechanism to maintain identity consistency, and ConsistencyNet to inject fine-grained features for detail consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CHEESE in advancing PCG, with SCheese achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

    "summary": "Missing-modality information on e-commerce platforms, such as absent product images or textual descriptions, often arises from annotation errors or incomplete metadata, impairing both product presentation and downstream applications such as recommendation systems. Motivated by the multimodal generative capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this work investigates a fundamental yet underexplored question: can MLLMs generate missing modalities for products in e-commerce scenarios? We propose the Missing Modality Product Completion Benchmark (MMPCBench), which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark.\n  We further evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families across nine real-world e-commerce categories, focusing on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks. Experimental results show that while MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel- or patch-level alignment. In addition, performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, and we observe no trivial correlation between model size and performance, in contrast to trends commonly reported in mainstream benchmarks. We also explore Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with this task. GRPO improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion. Overall, these findings expose the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation and represent an early step toward more effective missing-modality product completion.",

    "summary": "Video generation models have achieved notable progress in static scenarios, yet their performance in motion video generation remains limited, with quality degrading under drastic dynamic changes. This is due to noise disrupting temporal coherence and increasing the difficulty of learning dynamic regions. {Unfortunately, existing diffusion models rely on static loss for all scenarios, constraining their ability to capture complex dynamics.} To address this issue, we introduce Latent Temporal Discrepancy (LTD) as a motion prior to guide loss weighting. LTD measures frame-to-frame variation in the latent space, assigning larger penalties to regions with higher discrepancy while maintaining regular optimization for stable regions. This motion-aware strategy stabilizes training and enables the model to better reconstruct high-frequency dynamics. Extensive experiments on the general benchmark VBench and the motion-focused VMBench show consistent gains, with our method outperforming strong baselines by 3.31% on VBench and 3.58% on VMBench, achieving significant improvements in motion quality.",

In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop.

    "summary": "Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this, we propose MixKV, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. MixKV adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MixKV consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme compression (budget=64), MixKV improves baseline methods by an average of 5.1% across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves remarkable gains of 8.0% and 9.0% for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency. Furthermore, MixKV extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable performance gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/xuyang-liu16/MixKV.",

Motivated by this insight, we propose to \"contaminate\" real images using the generator's final component and train a detector to distinguish them from the original real images. We further introduce a taxonomy based on generators' final components and categorize 21 widely used generators accordingly, enabling a comprehensive investigation of our method's generalization capability.

    "summary": "Existing video object removal methods predominantly rely on diffusion models following a noise-to-data paradigm, where generation starts from uninformative Gaussian noise. This approach discards the rich structural and contextual priors present in the original input video. Consequently, such methods often lack sufficient guidance, leading to incomplete object erasure or the synthesis of implausible content that conflicts with the scene's physical logic. In this paper, we reformulate video object removal as a video-to-video translation task via a stochastic bridge model. Unlike noise-initialized methods, our framework establishes a direct stochastic path from the source video (with objects) to the target video (objects removed). This bridge formulation effectively leverages the input video as a strong structural prior, guiding the model to perform precise removal while ensuring that the filled regions are logically consistent with the surrounding environment. To address the trade-off where strong bridge priors hinder the removal of large objects, we propose a novel adaptive mask modulation strategy. This mechanism dynamically modulates input embeddings based on mask characteristics, balancing background fidelity with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and temporal consistency. The project page is https://bridgeremoval.github.io/.",

Current evaluation methodologies lack transparency, particularly in explaining the underlying causes of network misclassifications. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that investigates the relationship between the semantic hierarchy depth perceived by a network and its real-data misclassification patterns. Central to our framework is the Similarity Depth (SD) metric, which quantifies the semantic hierarchy depth perceived by a network along with a method of evaluation of how closely the network's errors align with its internally perceived similarity structure. We also propose a graph-based visualization of model semantic relationships and misperceptions. A key advantage of our approach is that leveraging class templates -- representations derived from classifier layer weights -- is applicable to already trained networks without requiring additional data or experiments. Our approach reveals that deep vision networks encode specific semantic hierarchies and that high semantic depth improves the compliance between perceived class similarities and actual errors.",

Specifically, MARE designs comprehensive reward functions, incorporating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to incentivize the generation of text-spatially aligned reasoning content that adheres to human preferences. Besides, MARE introduces a forgery disentanglement module to capture intrinsic forgery traces from high-level facial semantics, thereby improving its authenticity detection capability.

The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong robustness when handling rare characters, multilingual text, and handwritten content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-Parsing achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both the OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks. Overall, Youtu-Parsing demonstrates significant experimental value and practical utility for large-scale document intelligence applications.",

    "title": "GRTX: Efficient Ray Tracing for 3D Gaussian-Based Rendering",
    "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting has gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to its exceptional rendering performance and visual quality. While most existing methods rely on rasterization to render Gaussians, recent research has started investigating ray tracing approaches to overcome the fundamental limitations inherent in rasterization. However, current Gaussian ray tracing methods suffer from inefficiencies such as bloated acceleration structures and redundant node traversals, which greatly degrade ray tracing performance.\n  In this work, we present GRTX, a set of software and hardware optimizations that enable efficient ray tracing for 3D Gaussian-based rendering. First, we introduce a novel approach for constructing streamlined acceleration structures for Gaussian primitives. Our key insight is that anisotropic Gaussians can be treated as unit spheres through ray space transformations, which substantially reduces BVH size and traversal overhead. Second, we propose dedicated hardware support for traversal checkpointing within ray tracing units. This eliminates redundant node visits during multi-round tracing by resuming traversal from checkpointed nodes rather than restarting from the root node in each subsequent round. Our evaluation shows that GRTX significantly improves ray tracing performance compared to the baseline ray tracing method with a negligible hardware cost.",

Unlike prior methods that treat shape generation as a holistic process or only support part composition, our approach leverages four coordinated diffusion models to learn distributions of global shape latents, symmetries, semantic parts, and their spatial assembly. This structured pipeline ensures guaranteed symmetry, coherent part placement, and diverse, high-quality outputs. By disentangling the generative process into interpretable components, our method supports fine-grained control over shape attributes, enabling targeted manipulation of individual parts while preserving global consistency. A central global latent further reinforces structural coherence across assembled parts. Our experiments show that the Quartet achieves state-of-the-art performance. To our best knowledge, this is the first 3D point cloud generation framework that fully integrates and enforces both symmetry and part priors throughout the generative process.",

    "summary": "Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many existing methods involve trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Some achieve high precision but with slow inference speed, while others adopt purely bird's-eye-view (BEV)-based 2D representations to accelerate processing, inevitably sacrificing vertical cues and compromising geometric integrity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a pure 2D framework that achieves efficient 3D occupancy prediction while preserving geometric integrity. Unlike conventional Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) methods that rely solely on depth scores to lift 2D features into 3D space, our approach additionally introduces a height-score projection to encode vertical geometric structure. We further employ direction-aware convolution to extract geometric features along both vertical and horizontal orientations, effectively balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method achieves an mIoU of 39.3\\% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.",

    "summary": "We present a fast 3DGS reconstruction pipeline designed to converge within one minute, developed for the SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS Fast Reconstruction Challenge. The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition.",

    "summary": "Text-driven multi-human motion generation with complex interactions remains a challenging problem. Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance. This strategy not only enables fine-grained interaction modeling within each window but also preserves long-horizon coherence across all the long sequence. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HINT matches the performance of strong offline models and surpasses autoregressive baselines. Notably, on InterHuman, HINT achieves an FID of 3.100, significantly improving over the previous state-of-the-art score of 5.154.",

Traditional pixel-wise loss functions, including cross-entropy and Dice losses, often fail to capture high-level topological connectivity, resulting in topological mistakes in graphs obtained from prediction maps. In this paper, we propose CAPE (Connectivity-Aware Path Enforcement), a novel loss function designed to enforce connectivity in graphs obtained from segmentation maps by optimizing a graph connectivity metric. CAPE uses the graph representation of the ground truth to select node pairs and determine their corresponding paths within the predicted segmentation through a shortest-path algorithm. Using this, we penalize both disconnections and false positive connections, effectively promoting the model to preserve topological correctness. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets, including neuron and blood vessel tracing demonstrate that CAPE significantly improves topology-aware metrics and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "We introduce GenAgent, unifying visual understanding and generation through an agentic multimodal model. Unlike unified models that face expensive training costs and understanding-generation trade-offs, GenAgent decouples these capabilities through an agentic framework: understanding is handled by the multimodal model itself, while generation is achieved by treating image generation models as invokable tools. Crucially, unlike existing modular systems constrained by static pipelines, this design enables autonomous multi-turn interactions where the agent generates multimodal chains-of-thought encompassing reasoning, tool invocation, judgment, and reflection to iteratively refine outputs. We employ a two-stage training strategy: first, cold-start with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality tool invocation and reflection data to bootstrap agent behaviors; second, end-to-end agentic reinforcement learning combining pointwise rewards (final image quality) and pairwise rewards (reflection accuracy), with trajectory resampling for enhanced multi-turn exploration. GenAgent significantly boosts base generator(FLUX.1-dev) performance on GenEval++ (+23.6\\%) and WISE (+14\\%). Beyond performance gains, our framework demonstrates three key properties: 1) cross-tool generalization to generators with varying capabilities, 2) test-time scaling with consistent improvements across interaction rounds, and 3) task-adaptive reasoning that automatically adjusts to different tasks.

To address these issues, we propose RepSFNet (Reparameterized Single Fusion Network), a lightweight architecture designed for accurate and real-time crowd estimation. RepSFNet leverages a RepLK-ViT backbone with large reparameterized kernels for efficient multi-scale feature extraction. It further integrates a Feature Fusion module combining Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and Context-Aware Network (CAN) to achieve robust, density-adaptive context modeling. A Concatenate Fusion module is employed to preserve spatial resolution and generate high-quality density maps. By avoiding attention mechanisms and multi-branch designs, RepSFNet significantly reduces parameters and computational complexity. The training objective combines Mean Squared Error and Optimal Transport loss to improve both count accuracy and spatial distribution alignment. Experiments conducted on ShanghaiTech, NWPU, and UCF-QNRF datasets demonstrate that RepSFNet achieves competitive accuracy while reducing inference latency by up to 34 percent compared to recent state-of-the-art methods, making it suitable for real-time and low-power edge computing applications.",

    "summary": "The emergence of vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, has revolutionized image-text representation, enabling a broad range of applications via prompt learning. Despite its promise, real-world datasets often contain noisy labels that can degrade prompt learning performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that using mean absolute error (MAE) loss in prompt learning, named PromptMAE, significantly enhances robustness against noisy labels while maintaining high accuracy. Though MAE is straightforward and recognized for its robustness, it is rarely used in noisy-label learning due to its slow convergence and poor performance outside prompt learning scenarios. To elucidate the robustness of PromptMAE, we leverage feature learning theory to show that MAE can suppress the influence of noisy samples, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio and enhancing overall robustness. Additionally, we introduce PromptOT, a prompt-based optimal transport data purification method to enhance the robustness further. PromptOT employs text features in vision-language models as prototypes to construct an optimal transportation matrix. This matrix effectively partitions datasets into clean and noisy subsets, allowing for the application of cross-entropy loss to the clean subset and MAE loss to the noisy subset. Our Noise-Label Prompt Learning method, named NLPrompt, offers a simple and efficient approach that leverages the expressive representations and precise alignment capabilities of vision-language models for robust prompt learning. We validate NLPrompt through extensive experiments across various noise settings, demonstrating significant performance improvements.",

Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process. Moreover, we design a dual-domain latent autoencoder with a feature alignment constraint to support the proposed latent transport framework, which jointly encodes RGB and RAW inputs while promoting stable training and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAW-Flow outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and visually.",

These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.",

    "summary": "While many diffusion models perform well when controlling particular aspects such as style, character, and interaction, they struggle with fine-grained control due to dataset limitations and intricate model architecture design. This paper introduces a novel training-free algorithm for fine-grained generation, called Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models (AMDM). The algorithm integrates features in the latent data space from multiple diffusion models within the same ecosystem into a specified model, thereby activating particular features and enabling fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that AMDM significantly improves fine-grained control without training, validating its effectiveness. Additionally, it reveals that diffusion models initially focus on features such as position, attributes, and style, with later stages improving generation quality and consistency. AMDM offers a new perspective for tackling the challenges of fine-grained conditional generation in diffusion models. Specifically, it allows us to fully utilize existing or develop new conditional diffusion models that control specific aspects, and then aggregate them using the AMDM algorithm. This eliminates the need for constructing complex datasets, designing intricate model architectures, and incurring high training costs. Code is available at: https://github.com/Hammour-steak/AMDM.",

    "title": "PalmBridge: A Plug-and-Play Feature Alignment Framework for Open-Set Palmprint Verification",
    "summary": "Palmprint recognition is widely used in biometric systems, yet real-world performance often degrades due to feature distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous deployment conditions. Most deep palmprint models assume a closed and stationary distribution, leading to overfitting to dataset-specific textures rather than learning domain-invariant representations. Although data augmentation is commonly used to mitigate this issue, it assumes augmented samples can approximate the target deployment distribution, an assumption that often fails under significant domain mismatch. To address this limitation, we propose PalmBridge, a plug-and-play feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification based on vector quantization. Rather than relying solely on data-level augmentation, PalmBridge learns a compact set of representative vectors directly from training features. During enrollment and verification, each feature vector is mapped to its nearest representative vector under a minimum-distance criterion, and the mapped vector is then blended with the original vector. This design suppresses nuisance variation induced by domain shifts while retaining discriminative identity cues. The representative vectors are jointly optimized with the backbone network using task supervision, a feature-consistency objective, and an orthogonality regularization term to form a stable and well-structured shared embedding space. Furthermore, we analyze feature-to-representative mappings via assignment consistency and collision rate to assess model's sensitivity to blending weights. Experiments on multiple palmprint datasets and backbone architectures show that PalmBridge consistently reduces EER in intra-dataset open-set evaluation and improves cross-dataset generalization with negligible to modest runtime overhead.",

Unlike thresholdbased binarisation, which produces brittle masks under distribution shift, TDA allows anomalies to be characterised as disruptions to global structure rather than local fluctuations. We introduce TopoOT, a topology-aware optimal transport (OT) framework that integrates multi-filtration persistence diagrams (PDs) with test-time adaptation (TTA). Our key innovation is Optimal Transport Chaining, which sequentially aligns PDs across thresholds and filtrations, yielding geodesic stability scores that identify features consistently preserved across scales. These stabilityaware pseudo-labels supervise a lightweight head trained online with OT-consistency and contrastive objectives, ensuring robust adaptation under domain shift. Across standard 2D and 3D anomaly detection benchmarks, TopoOT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the most competitive methods by up to +24.1% mean F1 on 2D datasets and +10.2% on 3D AS benchmarks.",

Prior methods improve surface reconstruction by refining Gaussian depth estimates, either via multi-view geometric consistency or through monocular depth priors.

To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint that aggregates the visibility of shared Gaussian primitives across views, enabling more accurate and stable geometric supervision. In addition, we propose a progressive quadtree-calibrated Monocular depth constraint that performs block-wise affine calibration from coarse to fine spatial scales, mitigating the scale ambiguity of depth priors while preserving fine-grained surface details. Extensive experiments on DTU and TNT datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in geometric accuracy over prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods.

    "summary": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations. There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale, along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments, AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially localized WM group-level differences.

In this work, we address this gap by introducing BRISC, a dataset designed for brain tumor segmentation and classification tasks, featuring high-resolution segmentation masks. The dataset comprises 6,000 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans, which were collated from multiple public datasets that lacked segmentation labels. Our primary contribution is the subsequent expert annotation of these images, performed by certified radiologists and physicians. It includes three major tumor types, namely glioma, meningioma, and pituitary, as well as non-tumorous cases. Each sample includes high-resolution labels and is categorized across axial, sagittal, and coronal imaging planes to facilitate robust model development and cross-view generalization. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide benchmark results for both tasks using standard deep learning models.

However, existing CapsNet and variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing. Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size, equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields. Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters) to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in advancing feature representation learning.",

    "summary": "All-in-one image restoration aims to recover clean images from diverse unknown degradations using a single model. But extending this task to videos faces unique challenges. Existing approaches primarily focus on frame-wise degradation variation, overlooking the temporal continuity that naturally exists in real-world degradation processes. In practice, degradation types and intensities evolve smoothly over time, and multiple degradations may coexist or transition gradually. In this paper, we introduce the Smoothly Evolving Unknown Degradations (SEUD) scenario, where both the active degradation set and degradation intensity change continuously over time. To support this scenario, we design a flexible synthesis pipeline that generates temporally coherent videos with single, compound, and evolving degradations. To address the challenges in the SEUD scenario, we propose an all-in-One Recurrent Conditional and Adaptive prompting Network (ORCANet). First, a Coarse Intensity Estimation Dehazing (CIED) module estimates haze intensity using physical priors and provides coarse dehazed features as initialization. Second, a Flow Prompt Generation (FPG) module extracts degradation features. FPG generates both static prompts that capture segment-level degradation types and dynamic prompts that adapt to frame-level intensity variations. Furthermore, a label-aware supervision mechanism improves the discriminability of static prompt representations under different degradations. Extensive experiments show that ORCANet achieves superior restoration quality, temporal consistency, and robustness over image and video-based baselines.

However, recent black-box forgery attacks, where an attacker needs at least one watermarked image and black-box access to the provider's model, can embed the provider's watermark into images not produced by the provider, posing outsized risk to provenance and trust. We propose SemBind, the first defense framework for latent-based watermarks that resists black-box forgery by binding latent signals to image semantics via a learned semantic masker. Trained with contrastive learning, the masker yields near-invariant codes for the same prompt and near-orthogonal codes across prompts; these codes are reshaped and permuted to modulate the target latent before any standard latent-based watermark. SemBind is generally compatible with existing latent-based watermarking schemes and keeps image quality essentially unchanged, while a simple mask-ratio parameter offers a tunable trade-off between anti-forgery strength and robustness. Across four mainstream latent-based watermark methods, our SemBind-enabled anti-forgery variants markedly reduce false acceptance under black-box forgery while providing a controllable robustness-security balance.",

However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior generalization capability in real-world scenarios.",

    "summary": "All-in-one image restoration aims to address diverse degradation types using a single unified model. Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

    "summary": "Performance degradation due to covariate shift remains a major challenge for deep learning models in medical image segmentation. An open question is whether samples from a shifted distribution can effectively support learning when combined with limited target domain data. We investigate this problem in the context of bladder segmentation in CT guided gynecological brachytherapy, a critical task for accurate dose optimization and organ at risk sparing. While CT scans without brachytherapy applicators (no applicator: NA) are widely available, scans with applicators inserted (with applicator: WA) are scarce and exhibit substantial anatomical deformation and imaging artifacts, making automated segmentation particularly difficult.\n  We propose a dual domain learning strategy that integrates NA and WA CT data to improve robustness and generalizability under covariate shift. Using a curated assorted dataset, we show that NA data alone fail to capture the anatomical and artifact related characteristics of WA images. However, introducing a modest proportion of WA data into a predominantly NA training set leads to significant performance improvements. Through systematic experiments across axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using multiple deep learning architectures, we demonstrate that doping only 10 to 30 percent WA data achieves segmentation performance comparable to models trained exclusively on WA data.\n  The proposed approach attains Dice similarity coefficients of up to 0.94 and Intersection over Union scores of up to 0.92, indicating effective domain adaptation and improved clinical reliability. This study highlights the value of integrating anatomically similar but distribution shifted datasets to overcome data scarcity and enhance deep learning based segmentation for brachytherapy treatment planning.",

    "summary": "Autoregressive (AR) image generators offer a language-model-friendly approach to image generation by predicting discrete image tokens in a causal sequence. However, unlike diffusion models, AR models lack a mechanism to refine previous predictions, limiting their generation quality. In this paper, we introduce TensorAR, a new AR paradigm that reformulates image generation from next-token prediction to next-tensor prediction. By generating overlapping windows of image patches (tensors) in a sliding fashion, TensorAR enables iterative refinement of previously generated content. To prevent information leakage during training, we propose a discrete tensor noising scheme, which perturbs input tokens via codebook-indexed noise. TensorAR is implemented as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing AR models. Extensive experiments on LlamaGEN, Open-MAGVIT2, and RAR demonstrate that TensorAR significantly improves the generation performance of autoregressive models.",

We define these axes through a taxonomy of 10 prevalent artifact categories reflecting common generative failures observed in video generation. To enable robust artifact detection and categorization, we introduce GenVID, a large-scale dataset of 80k videos generated by various state-of-the-art video generation models, each carefully annotated for the defined artifact categories.

    "summary": "Multi-Agent System (MAS) powered by Visual Language Models (VLMs) enables challenging tasks but suffers from a novel failure term, multi-agent visual hallucination snowballing, where hallucinations are seeded in a single agent and amplified by following ones due to the over-reliance on textual flow to relay visual information. Through turn-, layer-, and token-wise attention analyses, we provide detailed insights into the essence of hallucination snowballing regarding the reduction of visual attention allocation. It leads us to identify a subset of vision tokens with a unimodal attention peak in middle layers that best preserve visual evidence but gradually diminish in deeper agent turns, resulting in the visual hallucination snowballing in MAS. Thus, we propose ViF, a lightweight, plug-and-play mitigation paradigm that relays inter-agent messages with Visual Flow powered by the selected visual relay tokens and applies attention reallocation to amplify this pattern. The experiment results demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination snowballing, consistently improving the performance across eight benchmarks based on four common MAS structures and ten base models.

Current methods primarily focus on static scenes, implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living. However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge, we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity.

    "summary": "Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.",

    "summary": "Domain adaptation (DA) addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain where image data distributions may differ. Existing DA methods often require access to source domain data, adversarial training, or complex pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method. It is the first approach to use multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain. Our method eliminates the need for source-target alignment or pseudo-label refinement by learning transferable representations solely from the target domain by enforcing consistency between multiple augmented views in the latent space. Additionally, the method ensures consistency in the learned features by generating multiple augmented views of target domain data and minimizing the distance between their feature representations in the latent space. We also introduce a ConvNeXt-based encoder and design a loss function that combines classification and consistency objectives to drive effective adaptation directly from the target domain. The proposed model achieves an average classification accuracy of 90. 72\\%, 84\\%, and 97. 12\\% in Office-31, Office-Home and Office-Caltech datasets, respectively.

While several distillation-based approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration, extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored, particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2, which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically, an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses, including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a single step.",

    "summary": "Recent studies have examined attention dynamics in large vision-language models (LVLMs) to detect hallucinations. However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability.

Using planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments - we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative pose estimation.

As demand for higher-resolution images and longer videos increases, single-GPU inference becomes inefficient due to increased latency and large activation sizes. Current frameworks employ sequence parallelism (SP) techniques such as Ulysses Attention and Ring Attention to scale inference. However, these implementations have three primary limitations: (1) suboptimal communication patterns for network topologies on modern GPU machines, (2) latency bottlenecks from all-to-all operations in inter-machine communication, and (3) GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads from using two-sided communication libraries. To address these issues, we present StreamFusion, a topology-aware efficient DiT serving engine. StreamFusion incorporates three key innovations: (1) a topology-aware sequence parallelism technique that accounts for inter- and intra-machine bandwidth differences, (2) Torus Attention, a novel SP technique enabling overlapping of inter-machine all-to-all operations with computation, and (3) a one-sided communication implementation that minimizes GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads.

Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity.

Pretraining uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking and objectives that encourage both local accuracy and global consistency, followed by cross-domain knowledge distillation. Experiments on 24 benchmark datasets spanning weather, energy, traffic, finance, and healthcare demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot multi-horizon forecasting, reducing mean squared error by 27.3 percent relative to strong baselines while requiring 94 percent less task-specific training data. The model exhibits near log-linear scaling with more pretraining data up to 100 billion points and processes length-512 sequences 3.8x faster than full-sequence transformers.",

    "title": "VSCOUT: A Hybrid Variational Autoencoder Approach to Outlier Detection in High-Dimensional Retrospective Monitoring",
    "summary": "Modern industrial and service processes generate high-dimensional, non-Gaussian, and contamination-prone data that challenge the foundational assumptions of classical Statistical Process Control (SPC). Heavy tails, multimodality, nonlinear dependencies, and sparse special-cause observations can distort baseline estimation, mask true anomalies, and prevent reliable identification of an in-control (IC) reference set. To address these challenges, we introduce VSCOUT, a distribution-free framework designed specifically for retrospective (Phase I) monitoring in high-dimensional settings. VSCOUT combines an Automatic Relevance Determination Variational Autoencoder (ARD-VAE) architecture with ensemble-based latent outlier filtering and changepoint detection. The ARD prior isolates the most informative latent dimensions, while the ensemble and changepoint filters identify pointwise and structural contamination within the determined latent space. A second-stage retraining step removes flagged observations and re-estimates the latent structure using only the retained inliers, mitigating masking and stabilizing the IC latent manifold. This two-stage refinement produces a clean and reliable IC baseline suitable for subsequent Phase II deployment. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that VSCOUT achieves superior sensitivity to special-cause structure while maintaining controlled false alarms, outperforming classical SPC procedures, robust estimators, and modern machine-learning baselines. Its scalability, distributional flexibility, and resilience to complex contamination patterns position VSCOUT as a practical and effective method for retrospective modeling and anomaly detection in AI-enabled environments.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces the MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for online model selection for nonstationary time series. Classical model selection methods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the stationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo gradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary, and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover, MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable across diverse problem settings.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for synthetic tabular data generation through in-context learning (ICL), offering a practical solution for data augmentation in data scarce scenarios. While prior work has shown the potential of LLMs to improve downstream task performance through augmenting underrepresented groups, these benefits often assume access to a subset of unbiased in-context examples, representative of the real dataset. In real-world settings, however, data is frequently noisy and demographically skewed. In this paper, we systematically study how statistical biases within in-context examples propagate to the distribution of synthetic tabular data, showing that even mild in-context biases lead to global statistical distortions. We further introduce an adversarial scenario where a malicious contributor can inject bias into the synthetic dataset via a subset of in-context examples, ultimately compromising the fairness of downstream classifiers for a targeted and protected subgroup. Finally, we evaluate mitigation strategies based on preprocessing in-context examples, demonstrating that while such interventions can attenuate disparity, the inherent sensitivity of LLMs to adversarial prompts remains a persistent challenge. Our findings highlight a critical new vulnerability in LLM-based data generation pipelines within sensitive domains.",

    "summary": "Machine learning predictions are increasingly used to supplement incomplete or costly-to-measure outcomes in fields such as biomedical research, environmental science, and social science. However, treating predictions as ground truth introduces bias while ignoring them wastes valuable information. Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) offers a principled framework that leverages predictions from large unlabeled datasets to improve statistical efficiency while maintaining valid inference through explicit bias correction using a smaller labeled subset. Despite its potential, the growing PPI variants and the subtle distinctions between them have made it challenging for practitioners to determine when and how to apply these methods responsibly. This paper demystifies PPI by synthesizing its theoretical foundations, methodological extensions, connections to existing statistics literature, and diagnostic tools into a unified practical workflow. Using the Mosaiks housing price data, we show that PPI variants produce tighter confidence intervals than complete-case analysis, but that double-dipping, i.e. reusing training data for inference, leads to anti-conservative confidence intervals and coverages. Under missing-not-at-random mechanisms, all methods, including classical inference using only labeled data, yield biased estimates. We provide a decision flowchart linking assumption violations to appropriate PPI variants, a summary table of selective methods, and practical diagnostic strategies for evaluating core assumptions. By framing PPI as a general recipe rather than a single estimator, this work bridges methodological innovation and applied practice, helping researchers responsibly integrate predictions into valid inference.",

    "summary": "Understanding the geometry of the loss landscape near a minimum is key to explaining the implicit bias of gradient-based methods in non-convex optimization problems such as deep neural network training and deep matrix factorization. A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in deep matrix factorization/deep linear neural network training problems, resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff & Michaeli (2020). This expression reveals a fundamental property of the loss landscape in deep matrix factorization: Having a constant product of the spectral norms of the left and right intermediate factors across layers is a sufficient condition for flatness. Most notably, in both depth-$2$ matrix and deep overparameterized scalar factorization, we show that this condition is both necessary and sufficient for flatness, which implies that flat minima are spectral-norm balanced even though they are not necessarily Frobenius-norm balanced. To complement our theory, we provide the first empirical characterization of an escape phenomenon during gradient-based training near a minimizer of a deep matrix factorization problem.",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by integrating external knowledge, yet retrieval models often miss relevant context, and generation models hallucinate with irrelevant data.

Our approach enhances retrieval precision through tree pruning and mitigates hallucinations via a re-ranking mechanism that integrates non-RAG solutions. Structuring external data into finer-grained nodes improves retrieval granularity. Evaluations on HumanEval and MBPP show up to 20% pass@1 accuracy gains and a 34% improvement over baselines on MBPP. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed PKG approach along with re-ranker effectively address complex problems while maintaining minimal negative impact on solutions that are already correct without RAG.

    "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a new generation of energy-efficient neural networks suitable for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. As neuromorphic hardware has limited memory and computational resources, parameter pruning and quantization have recently been explored to improve the efficiency of SNNs. State-of-the-art SNN pruning/quantization methods employ multiple compression and training iterations, increasing the cost for pre-trained or very large SNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot post-training compression framework, Spiking Brain Compression (SBC), that extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon method to SNNs. SBC replaces the current-based objective found in the common layer-wise compression method with a spike-train-based objective whose Hessian is cheaply computable, allowing a single backward pass to compress parameters and analytically rescale the rest. Applying SBC to SNN pruning and quantization across event-based and static datasets (up to ImageNet), including SEW-ResNet152 and spike-driven Transformers, we achieve state-of-the-art one-shot post-training compression for SNNs, with single- to double-digit accuracy gains over ANN compression baselines ported to SNNs. We further report a synaptic-operation-based energy proxy and a calibration-size ablation, demonstrating robust performance under sub-one-sample-per-class calibration.",

However, the growing availability of hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has made low-precision formats attractive due to their superior performance, reduced memory footprint, and improved energy efficiency. In this work, we investigate the role of mixed-precision arithmetic in neural-network based Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), a widely used method for solving computationally otherwise intractable quantum many-body systems. We first derive general analytical bounds on the error introduced by reduced precision on Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, and then empirically validate these bounds on the use-case of VMC. We demonstrate that significant portions of the algorithm, in particular, sampling the quantum state, can be executed in half precision without loss of accuracy. More broadly, this work provides a theoretical framework to assess the applicability of mixed-precision arithmetic in machine-learning approaches that rely on MCMC sampling. In the context of VMC, we additionally demonstrate the practical effectiveness of mixed-precision strategies, enabling more scalable and energy-efficient simulations of quantum many-body systems.",

First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+ε)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions. Finally, we establish a label complexity lower bound, showing our algorithm's dependence on the error tolerance $ε$ is close to optimal.",

We go beyond the no-free-lunch theorem in arXiv:2006.15785 by establishing a stronger impossibility result of adaptation that holds for arbitrarily large sample size per task.

In such settings, black-box copying provides a practical refactoring mechanism, i.e. upgrading legacy models by learning replicas from input-output queries alone. When restricted to hard-label outputs, copying turns into a discontinuous surface reconstruction problem from pointwise queries, severely limiting the ability to recover boundary geometry efficiently. We propose a distance-based copying (distillation) framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem that exploits local geometry. We develop an $α$-governed smoothing and regularization scheme with Hölder/Lipschitz control over the induced target surface, and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances under label-only access. Experiments on synthetic problems and UCI benchmarks show consistent improvements in fidelity and generalization accuracy over hard-label baselines, while enabling distance outputs as uncertainty-related signals for black-box replicas.",

While most data-driven forecasting approaches rely primarily on historical data from a single country, such data are often limited in length and variability, restricting the performance of machine learning (ML) models. In this work, we investigate a cross-country learning approach for infectious disease forecasting, in which a single model is trained on time series data from multiple countries and evaluated on a country of interest. This setting enables the model to exploit shared epidemic dynamics across countries and to benefit from an enlarged training set. We examine this approach through a case study on COVID-19 case forecasting in Cyprus, using surveillance data from European countries. We evaluate multiple ML models and analyse the impact of the lookback window length and cross-country `data augmentation' on multi-step forecasting performance. Our results show that incorporating data from other countries can lead to consistent improvements over models trained solely on national data. Although the empirical focus is on Cyprus and COVID-19, the proposed framework and findings are applicable to infectious disease forecasting more broadly, particularly in settings with limited national historical data.",

Standard first-order optimizers, such as SGD and Adam, struggle with \\emph{gradient conflicts} arising from competing objectives, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple utilization of a second-order quasi-Newton optimizer, \\textbf{SOAP}, dramatically improves both training efficiency and final performance across diverse LICs. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that Newton preconditioning inherently resolves the intra-step and inter-step update conflicts intrinsic to the R-D objective, facilitating faster, more stable convergence. Beyond acceleration, we uncover a critical deployability benefit: second-order trained models exhibit significantly fewer activation and latent outliers. This substantially enhances robustness to post-training quantization. Together, these results establish second-order optimization, achievable as a seamless drop-in replacement of the imported optimizer, as a powerful, practical tool for advancing the efficiency and real-world readiness of LICs.",

    "title": "Less is More: Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for Offline RL",
    "summary": "A fundamental challenge in offline reinforcement learning is distributional shift. Scarce data or datasets dominated by out-of-distribution (OOD) areas exacerbate this issue. Our theoretical analysis and experiments show that the standard squared error objective induces a harmful TD cross covariance. This effect amplifies in OOD areas, biasing optimization and degrading policy learning. To counteract this mechanism, we develop two complementary strategies: partitioned buffer sampling that restricts updates to localized replay partitions, attenuates irregular covariance effects, and aligns update directions, yielding a scheme that is easy to integrate with existing implementations, namely Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD (C^4). We also introduce an explicit gradient-based corrective penalty that cancels the covariance induced bias within each update. We prove that buffer partitioning preserves the lower bound property of the maximization objective, and that these constraints mitigate excessive conservatism in extreme OOD areas without altering the core behavior of policy constrained offline reinforcement learning. Empirically, our method showcases higher stability and up to 30% improvement in returns over prior methods, especially with small datasets and splits that emphasize OOD areas.",

    "summary": "Score-based diffusion models have recently been extended to infinite-dimensional function spaces, with uses such as inverse problems arising from partial differential equations. In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.",

    "summary": "Preference-Conditioned Policy Learning (PCPL) in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) aims to approximate diverse Pareto-optimal solutions by conditioning policies on user-specified preferences over objectives. This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

    "summary": "Constant rescaling of a Riemannian metric appears in many computational settings, often through a global scale parameter that is introduced either explicitly or implicitly. Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.",

Motivated by a recent simulation study that found that decision trees can be biased towards the minority class, our paper aims to reconcile the conflict between that study and other published works. First, we critically evaluate past literature on this problem, finding that failing to consider the conditional distribution of the outcome given the predictors has led to incorrect conclusions about the bias in decision trees. We then show that, under specific conditions, decision trees fit to purity are biased towards the minority class, debunking the belief that decision trees are always biased towards the majority class. This bias can be reduced by adjusting the tree-fitting process to include regularization methods like pruning and setting a maximum tree depth, and/or by using post-hoc calibration methods. Our findings have implications on the use of popular tree-based models, such as random forests. Although random forests are often composed of decision trees fit to purity, our work adds to recent literature indicating that this may not be the best approach.",

    "summary": "Biased gradient compression with error feedback (EF) reduces communication in federated learning (FL), but under non-IID data, the residual error can decay slowly, causing gradient mismatch and stalled progress in the early rounds. We propose step-ahead partial error feedback (SA-PEF), which integrates step-ahead (SA) correction with partial error feedback (PEF). SA-PEF recovers EF when the step-ahead coefficient $α=0$ and step-ahead EF (SAEF) when $α=1$. For non-convex objectives and $δ$-contractive compressors, we establish a second-moment bound and a residual recursion that guarantee convergence to stationarity under heterogeneous data and partial client participation. The resulting rates match standard non-convex Fed-SGD guarantees up to constant factors, achieving $O((η,η_0TR)^{-1})$ convergence to a variance/heterogeneity floor with a fixed inner step size. Our analysis reveals a step-ahead-controlled residual contraction $ρ_r$ that explains the observed acceleration in the early training phase. To balance SAEF's rapid warm-up with EF's long-term stability, we select $α$ near its theory-predicted optimum. Experiments across diverse architectures and datasets show that SA-PEF consistently reaches target accuracy faster than EF.",

    "summary": "The Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model is widely used in survival analysis. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN)-based Cox-PH models have been developed. However, training these Cox models with high-dimensional features typically requires a substantial number of labeled samples containing information about time-to-event. The limited availability of labeled data for training often constrains the performance of ANN-based Cox models. To address this issue, we employed a deep semi-supervised learning (DSSL) approach to develop single- and multi-modal ANN-based Cox models based on the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data for training. We applied our model, named Cox-MT, to predict the prognosis of several types of cancer using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our single-modal Cox-MT models, utilizing TCGA RNA-seq data or whole slide images, significantly outperformed the existing ANN-based Cox model, Cox-nnet, using the same data set across four types of cancer considered. As the number of unlabeled samples increased, the performance of Cox-MT significantly improved with a given set of labeled data. Furthermore, our multi-modal Cox-MT model demonstrated considerably better performance than the single-modal model. In summary, the Cox-MT model effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to significantly enhance prediction accuracy compared to existing ANN-based Cox models trained solely on labeled data.",

    "summary": "As lattice gauge theories with non-trivial topological features are driven towards the continuum limit, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations suffer for topological freezing, i.e., a dramatic growth of autocorrelations in topological observables. A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breaking translation invariance and introducing unphysical boundary artifacts. In this contribution we summarize a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove them by transporting configurations from a prior with a OBC defect to a fully periodic ensemble, and apply it to 4d SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. The method is based on a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that alternates non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers implemented via masked parametric stout smearing. Training is performed by minimizing the average dissipated work, equivalent to a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, to achieve more reversible trajectories and improved efficiency. We discuss the scaling with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the defect and show that defect SNFs achieve better performances than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at comparable cost. Finally, we validate the approach by reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility.",

    "summary": "Optimization under uncertainty is a fundamental problem in learning and decision-making, particularly in multi-agent systems. Previously, Feldman, Kalai, and Tennenholtz [2010] demonstrated the ability to efficiently compete in repeated symmetric two-player matrix games without observing payoffs, as long as the opponents actions are observed. In this paper, we introduce and formalize a new class of zero-sum symmetric Markov games, which extends the notion of symmetry from matrix games to the Markovian setting. We show that even without observing payoffs, a player who knows the transition dynamics and observes only the opponents sequence of actions can still compete against an adversary who may have complete knowledge of the game. We formalize three distinct notions of symmetry in this setting and show that, under these conditions, the learning problem can be reduced to an instance of online learning, enabling the player to asymptotically match the return of the opponent despite lacking payoff observations. Our algorithms apply to both matrix and Markov games, and run in polynomial time with respect to the size of the game and the number of episodes. Our work broadens the class of games in which robust learning is possible under severe informational disadvantage and deepens the connection between online learning and adversarial game theory.",

    "summary": "When solving optimization problems under uncertainty with contextual data, utilizing machine learning to predict the uncertain parameters' values is a popular and effective approach. Decision-focused learning (DFL) aims at learning a predictive model such that decision quality, instead of prediction accuracy, is maximized. Common practice is to predict a single scenario representing the uncertain parameters, implicitly assuming that there exists a deterministic problem approximation (proxy) that allows for optimal decision-making. The opposite has also been considered, where the underlying distribution is estimated with a parameterized distribution. However, little is known about when either choice is valid. This paper investigates for the first time problem properties that justify using a certain decision proxy. Using this, we present alternative decision proxies for DFL, with little or no compromise on the complexity of the learning task. We show the effectiveness of presented approaches in experiments on continuous and discrete problems, as well as problems with uncertainty in the objective function and in the constraints.",

We compare (i) structure-only node features (degree/closeness/eigenvector centrality, clustering, edge count) with (ii) 3072-D title/abstract embeddings, using an RF on graph-level aggregates and Graph Neural Networks with node features. Structure alone barely separates GPT from ground truth (RF accuracy $\\approx$ 0.60) despite cleanly rejecting the random baseline ($\\approx$ 0.89--0.92). By contrast, embeddings sharply increase separability: RF on aggregated embeddings reaches $\\approx$ 0.83, and GNNs with embedding node features achieve 93\\% test accuracy on GPT vs.\\ ground truth. We show the robustness of our findings by replicating the pipeline with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and with multiple embedding models (OpenAI and SPECTER), with RF separability for ground truth vs.\\ Claude $\\approx 0.77$ and clean rejection of the random baseline.

This structure is especially common in operations research applications such as inventory control, energy storage, and resource allocation, where exogenous randomness (e.g., demand, arrivals, or prices) drives system behavior. Despite decades of empirical evidence that greedy, exploitation-only methods work remarkably well in these settings, theory has lagged behind: all existing regret guarantees for Exo-MDPs rely on explicit exploration or tabular assumptions. We show that exploration is unnecessary. We propose Pure Exploitation Learning (PEL) and prove the first general finite-sample regret bounds for exploitation-only algorithms in Exo-MDPs. In the tabular case, PEL achieves $\\widetilde{O}(H^2|Ξ|\\sqrt{K})$. For large, continuous endogenous state spaces, we introduce LSVI-PE, a simple linear-approximation method whose regret is polynomial in the feature dimension, exogenous state space, and horizon, independent of the endogenous state and action spaces. Our analysis introduces two new tools: counterfactual trajectories and Bellman-closed feature transport, which together allow greedy policies to have accurate value estimates without optimism. Experiments on synthetic and resource-management tasks show that PEL consistently outperforming baselines. Overall, our results overturn the conventional wisdom that exploration is required, demonstrating that in Exo-MDPs, pure exploitation is enough.",

We instead learn an explicit optimal transport map that sends any group instance to its counterfactual without re-optimization, minimizing the group's total transport cost. This enables generalization with fewer parameters, making it easier to interpret the common actionable recourse. For linear classifiers, we prove that functions representing group counterfactuals are derived via mathematical optimization, identifying the underlying convex optimization type (QP, QCQP, ...). Experiments show that they accurately generalize, preserve group geometry and incur only negligible additional transport cost compared to baseline methods. If model linearity cannot be exploited, our approach also significantly outperforms the baselines.",

    "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing large language models' capabilities by generating intermediate reasoning steps for complex tasks. A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our \"Thought-Transfer\" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset. Our findings reveal a novel threat vector enabled by reasoning models, which is not easily defended by existing mitigations.",

To bridge this gap, we propose a positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation method for on-premise small-model deployment. Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistently strong performance under a low-cost setting.",

    "summary": "Change Point Detection (CPD) is a critical task in time series analysis, aiming to identify moments when the underlying data-generating process shifts. Traditional CPD methods often rely on unsupervised techniques, which lack adaptability to task-specific definitions of change and cannot benefit from user knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose MuRAL-CPD, a novel semi-supervised method that integrates active learning into a multiresolution CPD algorithm. MuRAL-CPD leverages a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition to detect changes across multiple temporal scales and incorporates user feedback to iteratively optimize key hyperparameters. This interaction enables the model to align its notion of change with that of the user, improving both accuracy and interpretability. Our experimental results on several real-world datasets show the effectiveness of MuRAL-CPD against state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios where minimal supervision is available.",

    "summary": "In this study, we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.",

Using noisy, synthetic data from two damped oscillatory systems, we explore the extrapolation capabilities of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the ability of Symbolic Regression (SR) to recover the underlying equations. Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation. While this last finding highlights an area for future work, our results suggest that using NODEs to enrich limited data and enable symbolic regression to infer physical laws represents a promising new approach for scientific discovery.",

Existing virtual sensor approaches require application-specific models with hand-selected inputs for each sensor, cannot leverage task synergies, and lack consistent benchmarks.

We introduce the first foundation model for virtual sensors addressing both limitations. Our unified model can simultaneously predict diverse virtual sensors exploiting synergies while maintaining computational efficiency. It learns relevant input signals for each virtual sensor, eliminating expert knowledge requirements while adding explainability. In our large-scale evaluation on a standard benchmark and an application-specific dataset with over 18 billion samples, our architecture achieves 415x reduction in computation time and 951x reduction in memory requirements, while maintaining or even improving predictive quality compared to baselines.

While the optical readout provides rich topological information, it produces large, sparse megapixel images that challenge real-time triggering, data reduction, and background discrimination.\n  We summarize two complementary machine-learning approaches developed within CYGNO. First, we present a fast and fully unsupervised strategy for online data reduction based on reconstruction-based anomaly detection. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images (i.e. frames acquired with GEM amplification disabled) learns the detector noise morphology and highlights particle-induced structures through localized reconstruction residuals, from which compact Regions of Interest (ROIs) are extracted. On real prototype data, the selected configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with ~25 ms per-frame inference time on a consumer GPU.\n  Second, we report a weakly supervised application of the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) framework to data acquired with an Americium--Beryllium neutron source. Using only mixed AmBe and standard datasets (no event-level labels), a convolutional classifier learns to identify nuclear-recoil-like topologies. The achieved performance approaches the theoretical limit imposed by the mixture composition and isolates a high-score population with compact, approximately circular morphologies consistent with nuclear recoils.",

Existing approaches predominantly rely on parameter updates or experience replay, which inevitably suffer from knowledge overwriting or privacy risks. To address this, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a privacy-preserving framework that maintains a dynamic pool of specialized forecasters. Instead of storing raw samples, CEP utilizes lightweight statistical genes to decouple concept identification from forecasting. Specifically, it employs a Retrieval mechanism to identify the nearest concept based on gene similarity, an Evolution strategy to spawn new forecasters upon detecting distribution shifts, and an Elimination policy to prune obsolete models under memory constraints. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CEP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing forecasting error by over 20% without accessing historical ground truth.",

We introduce the \"individual receptive field\" to uncover granular structural dependencies, revealing that convolutional layers act as feature extractors that mirror channel-wise attention while exhibiting superior robustness to non-linear fluctuations. Based on these insights, we propose ACFormer, an architecture designed to reconcile the efficiency of linear projections with the non-linear feature-extraction power of convolutions. ACFormer captures fine-grained information through a shared compression module, preserves temporal locality via gated attention, and reconstructs variable-specific temporal patterns using an independent patch expansion layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACFormer consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating the inherent drawbacks of linear models in capturing high-frequency components.",

    "summary": "Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix, which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened graphs.",

The proposed CoBA model integrates convolutional, bidirectional recurrent, and attention layers to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in UAV radio measurements. To validate the model, a dedicated dataset is collected using the 5G mmWave network at TalTech, with controlled low altitude UAV flights in authorized and restricted scenarios. The model is evaluated against conventional ML models and a fingerprinting-based benchmark. Experimental results show that CoBA achieves superior accuracy, significantly outperforming all baseline models and demonstrating its potential for reliable and regulated UAV airspace monitoring.",

Based on a discrete vocabulary of frequent motifs, our method merges samples with underlying patterns into tokens, compressing time series adaptively. Exploiting our finite set of motifs and the continuous properties of time series, we further introduce conditional decoding as a lightweight yet powerful post-hoc optimization method, which requires no gradient computation and adds no computational overhead. On recent time series foundation models, our motif-based tokenization improves forecasting performance by 36% and boosts efficiency by 1990% on average. Conditional decoding further reduces MSE by up to 44%. In an extensive analysis, we demonstrate the adaptiveness of our tokenization to diverse temporal patterns, its generalization to unseen data, and its meaningful token representations capturing distinct time series properties, including statistical moments and trends.",

These structures can be naturally represented by graphs, and the task of inferring such graphs from data is known as graph learning or as causal discovery if the graphs are given a causal interpretation. Existing approaches typically rely on restrictive assumptions about the data-generating process, employ greedy oracle algorithms, or solve approximate formulations of the graph learning problem. As a result, they are either sensitive to violations of central assumptions or fail to guarantee globally optimal solutions. We address these limitations by introducing a nonparametric graph learning framework based on nonparametric conditional independence testing and integer programming. We reformulate the graph learning problem as an integer-programming problem and prove that solving the integer-programming problem provides a globally optimal solution to the original graph learning problem. Our method leverages efficient encodings of graphical separation criteria, enabling the exact recovery of larger graphs than was previously feasible. We provide an implementation in the openly available R package 'glip' which supports learning (acyclic) directed (mixed) graphs and chain graphs. From the resulting output one can compute representations of the corresponding Markov equivalence classes or weak equivalence classes. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is faster than other existing exact graph learning procedures for a large fraction of instances and graphs of various sizes. GLIP also achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated data and benchmark datasets across all aforementioned classes of graphs.",

    "summary": "In earthwork and construction, excavators often encounter large rocks mixed with various soil conditions, requiring skilled operators. This paper presents a framework for achieving autonomous excavation using reinforcement learning (RL) through a rock excavation simulator. In the simulation, resolution can be defined by the particle size/number in the whole soil space. Fine-resolution simulations closely mimic real-world behavior but demand significant calculation time and challenging sample collection, while coarse-resolution simulations enable faster sample collection but deviate from real-world behavior. To combine the advantages of both resolutions, we explore using policies developed in coarse-resolution simulations for pre-training in fine-resolution simulations. To this end, we propose a novel policy learning framework called Progressive-Resolution Policy Distillation (PRPD), which progressively transfers policies through some middle-resolution simulations with conservative policy transfer to avoid domain gaps that could lead to policy transfer failure. Validation in a rock excavation simulator and nine real-world rock environments demonstrated that PRPD reduced sampling time to less than 1/7 while maintaining task success rates comparable to those achieved through policy learning in a fine-resolution simulation.

    "title": "Smart Exploration in Reinforcement Learning using Bounded Uncertainty Models",
    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for decision-making in uncertain environments, but it often requires large amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. We address this challenge by incorporating prior model knowledge to guide exploration and accelerate the learning process. Specifically, we assume access to a model set that contains the true transition kernel and reward function. We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and lower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of the agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the Q-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring policies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of the model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of exploring policies to the optimal policy. Lastly, we show that when the model set has a specific structure, namely the bounded-parameter MDP (BMDP) framework, the regularized model set optimization problem becomes convex and simple to implement. In this setting, we also prove finite-time convergence to the optimal policy under mild assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy, which we call BUMEX (Bounded Uncertainty Model-based Exploration), in a simulation study. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly accelerate learning in benchmark examples. A toolbox is available at https://github.com/JvHulst/BUMEX.",

    "summary": "During pretraining, LLMs inadvertently memorize sensitive or copyrighted data, posing significant compliance challenges under legal frameworks like the GDPR and the EU AI Act. Fulfilling these mandates demands techniques that can remove information from a deployed model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning approaches attempt to address this need, but often leak the very data they aim to erase, sacrifice fluency and robustness, or depend on costly external reward models. We introduce PURGE (Policy Unlearning through Relative Group Erasure), a novel method grounded in the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework that formulates unlearning as a verifiable problem. PURGE uses an intrinsic reward signal that penalizes any mention of forbidden concepts, allowing safe and consistent unlearning. Our approach reduces token usage per target by up to a factor of 46 compared with SotA methods, while improving fluency by 5.48 percent and adversarial robustness by 12.02 percent over the base model. On the Real World Knowledge Unlearning (RWKU) benchmark, PURGE achieves 11 percent unlearning effectiveness while preserving 98 percent of original utility. PURGE shows that framing LLM unlearning as a verifiable task, enables more reliable, efficient, and scalable forgetting, suggesting a promising new direction for unlearning research that combines theoretical guarantees, improved safety, and practical deployment efficiency.",

Our model is based on a trimmed SchNet architecture that selectively retains the most relevant atomic connections and incorporates trainable radial basis functions for geometric encoding. We validate our surrogate model on datasets from polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride melts, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and robust generalization across diverse polymer systems. In addition, the model captures key physical features, such as the characteristic decay behavior of MBD interactions, providing valuable insights for optimizing cutoff strategies. Characterized by high computational efficiency, our surrogate model enables practical incorporation of MBD effects into large-scale molecular simulations.",

Unlike most existing methods that implicitly assume a stationary data-generating process, in practise, mortgage portfolios are exposed to various forms of data drift caused by changing borrower behaviour, macroeconomic conditions, policy regimes and so on. This study investigates the impact of data drift on survival-based credit risk models and proposes a dynamic joint modelling framework to improve robustness under non-stationary environments. The proposed model integrates a longitudinal behavioural marker derived from balance dynamics with a discrete-time hazard formulation, combined with landmark one-hot encoding and isotonic calibration. Three types of data drift (sudden, incremental and recurring) are simulated and analysed on mortgage loan datasets from Freddie Mac. Experiments and corresponding evidence show that the proposed landmark-based joint model consistently outperforms classical survival models, tree-based drift-adaptive learners and gradient boosting methods in terms of discrimination and calibration across all drift scenarios, which confirms the superiority of our model design.",

    "summary": "Multi-connectivity involves dynamic cluster formation among distributed access points (APs) and coordinated resource allocation from these APs, highlighting the need for efficient mobility management strategies for users with multi-connectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel mobility management scheme for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that uses dynamic cluster reconfiguration with energy-efficient power allocation in a wireless interference network. Our objective encompasses meeting stringent reliability demands, minimizing joint power consumption, and reducing the frequency of cluster reconfiguration. To achieve these objectives, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (H-MADRL) framework, specifically tailored for dynamic clustering and power allocation. The edge cloud connected with a set of APs through low latency optical back-haul links hosts the high-level agent responsible for the optimal clustering policy, while low-level agents reside in the APs and are responsible for the power allocation policy. To further improve the learning efficiency, we propose a novel action-observation transition-driven learning algorithm that allows the low-level agents to use the action space from the high-level agent as part of the local observation space. This allows the lower-level agents to share partial information about the clustering policy and allocate the power more efficiently. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed distributed algorithm achieves comparable performance to the centralized algorithm. Additionally, it offers better scalability, as the decision time for clustering and power allocation increases by only 10% when doubling the number of APs, compared to a 90% increase observed with the centralized approach.",

Existing defenses require exchanging high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors each round, creating prohibitive costs at scale. We propose SketchGuard, which decouples Byzantine filtering from aggregation via sketch-based screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to $k$-dimensional sketches ($k \\ll d$) using Count Sketch, then fetches full models only from accepted neighbors, reducing communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| + d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \\le |N_i|$ is the accepted count. We prove convergence in strongly convex and non-convex settings, showing that approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(ε))$ factor in the effective threshold. Experiments demonstrate SketchGuard maintains state-of-the-art robustness (mean TER deviation $\\leq$0.5 percentage points) while reducing computation by up to 82% and communication by 50-70%.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) solution to the dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on Variational Quantum Circuits. The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

    "summary": "Recently, structure-text contrastive learning has shown promising performance on text-attributed graphs by leveraging the complementary strengths of graph neural networks and language models. However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.",

Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks.

    "summary": "We study the geometric properties of random neural networks by investigating the boundary volumes of their excursion sets for different activation functions, as the depth increases. More specifically, we show that, for activations which are not very regular (e.g., the Heaviside step function), the boundary volumes exhibit fractal behavior, with their Hausdorff dimension monotonically increasing with the depth. On the other hand, for activations which are more regular (e.g., ReLU, logistic and $\\tanh$), as the depth increases, the expected boundary volumes can either converge to zero, remain constant or diverge exponentially, depending on a single spectral parameter which can be easily computed. Our theoretical results are confirmed in some numerical experiments based on Monte Carlo simulations.",

    "summary": "Unsupervised representation learning for wireless channel state information (CSI)reduces reliance on labeled data, thereby lowering annotation costs, and often improves performance on downstream tasks. However, state-of-the-art approaches take little or no account of domain-specific knowledge, forcing the model to learn well-known concepts solely from data. We introduce Sparse pretrained Radio Transformer (SpaRTran), a hybrid method based on the concept of compressed sensing for wireless channels. In contrast to existing work, SpaRTran builds around a wireless channel model that constrains the optimization procedure to physically meaningful solutions and induces a strong inductive bias. Compared to the state of the art, SpaRTran cuts positioning error by up to 28% and increases top-1 codebook selection accuracy for beamforming by 26 percentage points. Our results show that capturing the sparse nature of radio propagation as an unsupervised learning objective improves performance for network optimization and radio-localization tasks.",

    "summary": "Quantum error correction is indispensable to achieving reliable quantum computation. When quantum information is encoded redundantly, a larger Hilbert space is constructed using multiple physical qubits, and the computation is performed within a designated subspace. When applying deep learning to the decoding of quantum error-correcting codes, a key challenge arises from the non-uniqueness between the syndrome measurements provided to the decoder and the corresponding error patterns that constitute the ground-truth labels. Building upon prior work that addressed this issue for the toric code by re-optimizing the decoder with respect to the symmetry inherent in the parity-check structure, we generalize this approach to arbitrary stabilizer codes. In our experiments, we employed multilayer perceptrons to approximate continuous functions that complement the syndrome measurements of the Color code and the Golay code. Using these models, we performed decoder re-optimization for each code. For the Color code, we achieved an improvement of approximately 0.8% in decoding accuracy at a physical error rate of 5%, while for the Golay code the accuracy increased by about 0.1%. Furthermore, from the evaluation of the geometric and algebraic structures in the continuous function approximation for each code, we showed that the design of generalized continuous functions is advantageous for learning the geometric structure inherent in the code. Our results also indicate that approximations that faithfully reproduce the code structure can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of reoptimization. This study demonstrates that the re-optimization technique previously shown to be effective for the Toric code can be generalized to address the challenge of label degeneracy that arises when applying deep learning to the decoding of stabilizer codes.",

    "summary": "Developing human understandable interpretation of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly critical for their deployment in essential domains. Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem. We implement 12 sparse ConCA variants and demonstrate their ability to extract meaningful concepts across multiple LLMs, offering theory-backed advantages over SAEs.",

Motivated by the prevalence of heavy-tailed gradients in modern machine learning, we then propose randomized subspace normalized SGD (RS-NSGD), which integrates direction normalization into subspace updates. Assuming the noise has bounded $p$-th moments, we establish both in-expectation and high-probability convergence guarantees, and show that RS-NSGD can achieve better oracle complexity than full-dimensional normalized SGD.",

    "summary": "This study addresses the challenge of accurately identifying multi-task contention types in high-dimensional system environments and proposes a unified contention classification framework that integrates representation transformation, structural modeling, and a task decoupling mechanism. The method first constructs system state representations from high-dimensional metric sequences, applies nonlinear transformations to extract cross-dimensional dynamic features, and integrates multiple source information such as resource utilization, scheduling behavior, and task load variations within a shared representation space. It then introduces a graph-based modeling mechanism to capture latent dependencies among metrics, allowing the model to learn competitive propagation patterns and structural interference across resource links. On this basis, task-specific mapping structures are designed to model the differences among contention types and enhance the classifier's ability to distinguish multiple contention patterns. To achieve stable performance, the method employs an adaptive multi-task loss weighting strategy that balances shared feature learning with task-specific feature extraction and generates final contention predictions through a standardized inference process. Experiments conducted on a public system trace dataset demonstrate advantages in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1, and sensitivity analyses on batch size, training sample scale, and metric dimensionality further confirm the model's stability and applicability. The study shows that structured representations and multi-task classification based on high-dimensional metrics can significantly improve contention pattern recognition and offer a reliable technical approach for performance management in complex computing environments.",

    "summary": "Identifying safety-critical scenarios is essential for autonomous driving, but the rarity of such events makes supervised labeling impractical. Traditional rule-based metrics like Time-to-Collision are too simplistic to capture complex interaction risks, and existing methods lack a systematic way to verify whether statistical anomalies truly reflect physical danger. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a multi-agent Transformer that models normal driving and measures deviations through prediction residuals. A dual evaluation scheme has been proposed to assess both detection stability and physical alignment: Stability is measured using standard ranking metrics in which Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient captures rank agreement and Jaccard index captures the consistency of the top-K selected items; Physical alignment is assessed through correlations with established Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM). Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness: We show that the maximum residual aggregator achieves the highest physical alignment while maintaining stability. Furthermore, our framework identifies 388 unique anomalies missed by Time-to-Collision and statistical baselines, capturing subtle multi-agent risks like reactive braking under lateral drift. The detected anomalies are further clustered into four interpretable risk types, offering actionable insights for simulation and testing.",

This coupling degrades accuracy and can destabilize training when enforcing PDE, boundary, and initial constraints jointly. We propose Time-Induced Neural Networks (TINNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes the network weights as a learned function of time, allowing the effective spatial representation to evolve over time while maintaining shared structure. The resulting formulation naturally yields a nonlinear least-squares problem, which we optimize efficiently using a Levenberg--Marquardt method.

Block-wise diffusion can reduce this cost, yet it typically relies on retraining and constrained update orders, limiting its direct applicability to pretrained DLMs. Our token-level analysis reveals pronounced structural locality in DLM inference. Decoding is driven by a small set of prefix-localized active tokens; the influence of distant undecoded context diminishes rapidly, and decoded tokens exhibit stage-wise temporal stability, enabling reuse of intermediate representations except for a brief post-decode transient. Motivated by these observations, we propose \\textbf{\\placeholder}\\footnote{The source code is available at https://github.com/vhicrgit/Window-Diffusion.}, a window-based token pruning and caching method for inference. We maintain a local computation window that slides rightward as denoising progresses, and partition undecoded tokens into: (i) \\textit{active tokens} that are computed online, (ii) \\textit{buffer tokens} whose KV states are cached and periodically refreshed, and (iii) \\textit{far-field tokens} that are pruned outside the window. Computation is restricted to active and buffer tokens within the window, while far-field tokens are omitted at each stage.

Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router. Moreover, READER dynamically calibrates the regression target to mitigate under-estimation caused by incomplete labels. Experimental results show that READER yields superior performance on TRACE over baselines, achieving a 2.19% improvement in terms of accuracy. We believe that our study will open up a new avenue for studying online delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction, and our TRACE benchmark with the gathered insights will facilitate future research and application in this promising direction.

    "summary": "Partial Optimal Transport (POT) addresses the problem of transporting only a fraction of the total mass between two distributions, making it suitable when marginals have unequal size or contain outliers. While Sinkhorn-based methods are widely used, their complexity bounds for POT remain suboptimal and can limit scalability. We introduce Accelerated Sinkhorn for POT (ASPOT), which integrates alternating minimization with Nesterov-style acceleration in the POT setting, yielding a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^{7/3}\\varepsilon^{-5/3})$. We also show that an informed choice of the entropic parameter $γ$ improves rates for the classical Sinkhorn method. Experiments on real-world applications validate our theories and demonstrate the favorable performance of our proposed methods.",

    "title": "A Learning-based Framework for Spatial Impulse Response Compensation in 3D Photoacoustic Computed Tomography",
    "summary": "Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.",

    "summary": "Dynamic behaviors are becoming prevalent in tensor applications, like machine learning, where many widely used models contain data-dependent tensor shapes and control flow. However, the limited expressiveness of prior programming abstractions for spatial dataflow accelerators (SDAs) forces these dynamic behaviors to be implemented statically and/or unoptimized. To address these challenges, we present Streaming Tensor Programs (STeP), a streaming abstraction that enables dynamic tensor workloads to run efficiently on SDAs. STeP introduces flexible routing operators, an explicit memory hierarchy, and symbolic-shape semantics that expose dynamic data rates and tensor dimensions. These capabilities unlock new optimizations, like dynamic tiling, dynamic parallelization, and configuration time-multiplexing, that adapt SDA execution to dynamic behaviors while preserving dataflow efficiency. Using a cycle-approximate simulator on representative LLM layers and a full model with real-world traces, STeP enables: dynamic tiling that breaks the Pareto-optimal frontier from prior work, dynamic parallelization that improves latency by ~2.72x, and configuration time-multiplexing that increases compute utilization by ~2.64x over prior SDA abstractions and their implementations.",

    "summary": "While explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for large language models (LLMs) remains an evolving field with many unresolved questions, increasing regulatory pressures have spurred interest in its role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and privacy-preserving machine unlearning. Despite recent advances in XAI have provided some insights, the specific role of attention layers in transformer based LLMs remains underexplored. This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords. We provide converging evidence for this keywords-as-cues hypothesis. In addition, we isolate neurons within attention layers whose activations selectively encode and facilitate the retrieval of context-defining keywords. Consequently, these keywords can be extracted from identified neurons and further contribute to downstream applications such as unlearning.",

    "summary": "Machine learning models in high-stakes applications, such as recidivism prediction and automated personnel selection, often exhibit systematic performance disparities across sensitive subpopulations, raising critical concerns regarding algorithmic bias. Fairness auditing addresses these risks through two primary functions: certification, which verifies adherence to fairness constraints; and flagging, which isolates specific demographic groups experiencing disparate treatment. However, existing auditing techniques are frequently limited by restrictive distributional assumptions or prohibitive computational overhead. We propose a novel empirical likelihood-based (EL) framework that constructs robust statistical measures for model performance disparities. Unlike traditional methods, our approach is non-parametric; the proposed disparity statistics follow asymptotically chi-square or mixed chi-square distributions, ensuring valid inference without assuming underlying data distributions. This framework uses a constrained optimization profile that admits stable numerical solutions, facilitating both large-scale certification and efficient subpopulation discovery. Empirically, the EL methods outperform bootstrap-based approaches, yielding coverage rates closer to nominal levels while reducing computational latency by several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the practical utility of this framework on the COMPAS dataset, where it successfully flags intersectional biases, specifically identifying a significantly higher positive prediction rate for African-American males under 25 and a systemic under-prediction for Caucasian females relative to the population mean.",

However, existing CBF-STL approaches typically rely on fixed hyperparameters and per-step optimization, which can lead to overly conservative behavior, infeasibility near tight input limits, and difficulty satisfying long-horizon STL tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a feasibility-aware learning framework that constructs trainable, time-varying High Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) constraints and hyperparameters that guarantee satisfaction of a given STL specification. We introduce a unified robustness measure that jointly captures STL satisfaction, constraint feasibility, and control-bound compliance, and propose a neural network architecture to generate control inputs that maximize this robustness. The resulting controller guarantees STL satisfaction with strictly feasible HOCBF constraints and requires no manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains high STL robustness under tight input bounds and significantly outperforms fixed-parameter and non-adaptive baselines in complex environments.",

    "summary": "Log-based anomaly detection is critical for ensuring the stability and reliability of web systems. One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that FusionLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art cross-system log-based anomaly detection methods.",

    "summary": "Vision Language Action (VLA) models promise an open-vocabulary interface that can translate perceptual ambiguity into semantically grounded driving decisions, yet they still treat language as a static prior fixed at inference time. As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech.",

    "summary": "The Talking Face Generation task has enormous potential for various applications in digital humans and agents, etc. Singing, as a common facial movement second only to talking, can be regarded as a universal language across ethnicities and cultures. However, it is often underestimated in the field due to lack of singing face datasets and the domain gap between singing and talking in rhythm and amplitude. More significantly, the quality of Singing Face Generation (SFG) often falls short and is uneven or limited by different applicable scenarios, which prompts us to propose timely and effective quality assessment methods to ensure user experience. To address existing gaps in this domain, this paper introduces a new SFG content quality assessment dataset SFQA, built using 12 representative generation methods. During the construction of the dataset, 100 photographs or portraits, as well as 36 music clips from 7 different styles, are utilized to generate 5,184 singing face videos that constitute the SFQA dataset. To further explore the quality of SFG methods, subjective quality assessment is conducted by evaluators, whose ratings reveal a significant variation in quality among different generation methods. Based on our proposed SFQA dataset, we comprehensively benchmark the current objective quality assessment algorithms.",

Unlike conventional automation that relies on labor-intensive 2D labeling, our framework leverages reusable warm-up trajectories to extract implicit spatial information, thereby achieving calibration-aware, depth-resolved perception without the need for external fiducials or manual depth annotation. By explicitly characterizing residuals from observation and calibration models, the system establishes a task-space error budget from recorded warm-ups. The uncertainty budget yields a lateral closed-loop accuracy of approx. 49 micrometers at 95% confidence (worst-case testing subset) and a depth accuracy of <= 291 micrometers at 95% confidence bound during large in-plane moves.

    "summary": "Tendon-driven anthropomorphic robotic hands often lack direct joint angle sensing, as the integration of joint encoders can compromise mechanical compactness and dexterity. This paper presents a computational method for estimating joint positions from measured tendon displacements and tensions. An efficient kinematic modeling framework for anthropomorphic hands is first introduced based on the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. Using a simplified tendon model, a system of nonlinear equations relating tendon states to joint positions is derived and solved via a nonlinear optimization approach. The estimated joint angles are then employed for closed-loop control through a Jacobian-based proportional-integral (PI) controller augmented with a feedforward term, enabling gesture tracking without direct joint sensing. The effectiveness and limitations of the proposed estimation and control framework are demonstrated in the MuJoCo simulation environment using the Anatomically Correct Biomechatronic Hand, featuring five degrees of freedom for each long finger and six degrees of freedom for the thumb.",

    "summary": "Training reinforcement learning (RL) policies for legged robots remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous actions, hardware constraints, and limited exploration. Existing methods for locomotion and whole-body control work well for position-based control with environment-specific heuristics (e.g., reward shaping, curriculum design, and manual initialization), but are less effective for torque-based control, where sufficiently exploring the action space and obtaining informative gradient signals for training is significantly more difficult. We introduce Growing Policy Optimization (GPO), a training framework that applies a time-varying action transformation to restrict the effective action space in the early stage, thereby encouraging more effective data collection and policy learning, and then progressively expands it to enhance exploration and achieve higher expected return. We prove that this transformation preserves the PPO update rule and introduces only bounded, vanishing gradient distortion, thereby ensuring stable training. We evaluate GPO on both quadruped and hexapod robots, including zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies on hardware. Policies trained with GPO consistently achieve better performance. These results suggest that GPO provides a general, environment-agnostic optimization framework for learning legged locomotion.",

    "summary": "A novel relative localization approach for guidance of a micro-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) by a well-equipped aerial robot fusing Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is proposed in this paper. LiDAR-based localization is accurate and robust to challenging environmental conditions, but 3D LiDARs are relatively heavy and require large UAV platforms, in contrast to lightweight cameras. However, visual-based self-localization methods exhibit lower accuracy and can suffer from significant drift with respect to the global reference frame. To benefit from both sensory modalities, we focus on cooperative navigation in a heterogeneous team of a primary LiDAR-equipped UAV and a secondary micro-scale camera-equipped UAV. We propose a novel cooperative approach combining LiDAR relative localization data with VIO output on board the primary UAV to obtain an accurate pose of the secondary UAV. The pose estimate is used to precisely and reliably guide the secondary UAV along trajectories defined in the primary UAV reference frame. The experimental evaluation has shown the superior accuracy of our method to the raw VIO output, reaching the average 3D Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) of 0.28 m, and demonstrated its capability to guide the secondary UAV along desired trajectories while mitigating VIO drift. Thus, such a heterogeneous system can explore large areas with LiDAR precision, as well as visit locations inaccessible to the large LiDAR-carrying UAV platforms, as was showcased in a real-world cooperative mapping scenario.",

    "summary": "Multi-robot systems have been widely deployed in real-world applications, providing significant improvements in efficiency and reductions in labor costs. However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.",

This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.",

    "summary": "Robotic prospecting for critical resources on the Moon, such as ilmenite, rare earth elements, and water ice, requires robust exploration methods given the diverse terrain and harsh environmental conditions. Although numerous analog field trials address these goals, comparing their results remains challenging because of differences in robot platforms and experimental setups. These missions typically assess performance using selected, scenario-specific engineering metrics that fail to establish a clear link between field performance and science-driven objectives. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving a structured framework of KPI from three realistic multi-robot lunar scenarios reflecting scientific objectives and operational constraints. Our framework emphasizes scenario-dependent priorities in efficiency, robustness, and precision, and is explicitly designed for practical applicability in field deployments. We validated the framework in a multi-robot field test and found it practical and easy to apply for efficiency- and robustness-related KPI, whereas precision-oriented KPI require reliable ground-truth data that is not always feasible to obtain in outdoor analog environments. Overall, we propose this framework as a common evaluation standard enabling consistent, goal-oriented comparison of multi-robot field trials and supporting systematic development of robotic systems for future planetary exploration.",

We propose STORM (Slot-based Task-aware Object-centric Representation for robotic Manipulation), a lightweight object-centric adaptation module that augments frozen visual foundation models with a small set of semantic-aware slots for robotic manipulation. Rather than retraining large backbones, STORM employs a multi-phase training strategy: object-centric slots are first stabilized through visual--semantic pretraining using language embeddings, then jointly adapted with a downstream manipulation policy. This staged learning prevents degenerate slot formation and preserves semantic consistency while aligning perception with task objectives. Experiments on object discovery benchmarks and simulated manipulation tasks show that STORM improves generalization to visual distractors, and control performance compared to directly using frozen foundation model features or training object-centric representations end-to-end. Our results highlight multi-phase adaptation as an efficient mechanism for transforming generic foundation model features into task-aware object-centric representations for robotic control.",

However, current vision-based solutions are limited by the inherent constraints of optical sensors, while radio-frequency (RF) approaches, which can reveal intrinsic material properties, have received growing attention. Despite this progress, RF-based material identification remains hindered by the lack of large-scale public datasets and the limited benchmarking of learning-based approaches. In this work, we present RF-MatID, the first open-source, large-scale, wide-band, and geometry-diverse RF dataset for fine-grained material identification. RF-MatID includes 16 fine-grained categories grouped into 5 superclasses, spanning a broad frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz, and comprises 142k samples in both frequency- and time-domain representations. The dataset systematically incorporates controlled geometry perturbations, including variations in incidence angle and stand-off distance. We further establish a multi-setting, multi-protocol benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models, assessing both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness under cross-angle and cross-distance shifts. The 5 frequency-allocation protocols enable systematic frequency- and region-level analysis, thereby facilitating real-world deployment.

    "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as powerful generalists for robotic manipulation. However, due to their predominant reliance on visual modalities, they fundamentally lack the physical intuition required for contact-rich tasks that require precise force regulation and physical reasoning. Existing attempts to incorporate vision-based tactile sensing into VLA models typically treat tactile inputs as auxiliary visual textures, thereby overlooking the underlying correlation between surface deformation and interaction dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm shift from tactile-vision alignment to tactile-force alignment. Here, we introduce TaF-VLA, a framework that explicitly grounds high-dimensional tactile observations in physical interaction forces. To facilitate this, we develop an automated tactile-force data acquisition device and curate the TaF-Dataset, comprising over 10 million synchronized tactile observations, 6-axis force/torque, and matrix force map. To align sequential tactile observations with interaction forces, the central component of our approach is the Tactile-Force Adapter (TaF-Adapter), a tactile sensor encoder that extracts discretized latent information for encoding tactile observations. This mechanism ensures that the learned representations capture history-dependent, noise-insensitive physical dynamics rather than static visual textures. Finally, we integrate this force-aligned encoder into a VLA backbone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that TaF-VLA policy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tactile-vision-aligned and vision-only baselines on contact-rich tasks, verifying its ability to achieve robust, force-aware manipulation through cross-modal physical reasoning.",

    "summary": "This paper presents an algorithm to improve state estimation for legged robots. Among existing model-based state estimation methods for legged robots, the contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter defines the state on a Lie group to preserve invariance, thereby significantly accelerating convergence. It achieves more accurate state estimation by leveraging contact information as measurements for the update step. However, when the model exhibits strong nonlinearity, the estimation accuracy decreases. Such nonlinearities can cause initial errors to accumulate and lead to large drifts over time. To address this issue, we propose compensating for errors by augmenting the Kalman filter with an artificial neural network serving as a nonlinear function approximator. Furthermore, we design this neural network to respect the Lie group structure to ensure invariance, resulting in our proposed Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (InNKF). The proposed algorithm offers improved state estimation performance by combining the strengths of model-based and learning-based approaches.

    "summary": "Autonomous vehicle safety validation requires testing on safety-critical scenarios, but these events are rare in real-world driving and costly to test due to collision risks. Crash reports provide authentic specifications of safety-critical events, offering a vital alternative to scarce real-world collision trajectory data. This makes them valuable sources for generating realistic high-risk scenarios through simulation. Existing approaches face significant limitations because data-driven methods lack diversity due to their reliance on existing latent distributions, whereas adversarial methods often produce unrealistic scenarios lacking physical fidelity. Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM)-based methods show significant promise. However, they suffer from context suppression issues where internal parametric knowledge overrides crash specifications, producing scenarios that deviate from actual accident characteristics. This paper presents SG-CADVLM (A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation), a framework that integrates Context-Aware Decoding with multi-modal input processing to generate safety-critical scenarios from crash reports and road network diagrams. The framework mitigates VLM hallucination issues while enabling the simultaneous generation of road geometry and vehicle trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate that SG-CADVLM generates critical risk scenarios at a rate of 84.4% compared to 12.5% for the baseline methods, representing an improvement of 469%, while producing executable simulations for autonomous vehicle testing.",

In contrast, systematic transformer layer reduction has received limited attention and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored for flow-based VLA models under knowledge distillation. In this work, we propose Shallow-pi, a principled knowledge distillation framework that aggressively reduces the transformer depth of both the VLM backbone and the flow-based action head, compressing the model from 18 to 6 layers. Shallow-pi achieves over two times faster inference with less than one percent absolute drop in success rate on standard manipulation benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance among reduced VLA models. Crucially, we validate our approach through industrial-scale real-world experiments on Jetson Orin and Jetson Thor across multiple robot platforms, including humanoid systems, in complex and dynamic manipulation scenarios.",
