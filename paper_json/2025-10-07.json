    "title": "EgoNight: Towards Egocentric Vision Understanding at Night with a\n  Challenging Benchmark",
    "summary": "Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily\non daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable\nin real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual\nquestion answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the\nintroduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation\nquality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between\nlighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered\nby Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are\nvisually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct\nEgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and\nrefinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked\nby annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs\nacross 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of\nhuman work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to\nnight, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.\nBeyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night\ncorrespondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further\nexplore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a\nstrong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research\nand for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the\ndata and code will be made available upon acceptance.",

    "summary": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework\nfor enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),\nparticularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their\npotential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains\nunderexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing\nPRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle\nwith table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema\ninteraction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this\nlimitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)\nreasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based\nverification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design\na scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality\nstep-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with\ntool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a\ndual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use\nreasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded\nreward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly\ndesigned PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering\nnumerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves\ndownstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines\nsuch as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong\ngeneralizability across diverse TTS strategies.",

    "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as\nsearch engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that\nStratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3\npoints, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more\neffective search policies. These results establish stratification as a\nprincipled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.",

In this\npaper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning\nframework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation\nwith the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an\nexisting LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a\nVariational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of\nthought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while\noffering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a\nlatent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens\nwith a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and\niterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows\nefficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the\nmodel to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm\nin which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces\n(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework\nleverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative\nrefinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic\nevaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares\ngenerative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,\ninteraction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and\nemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces\nconsistently outperform conversational ones, with up to a 72% improvement in\nhuman preference. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative\ninterfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.",

These models have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation\nbenchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the\nrepresentational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer\nfrom shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of\nspeech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute\nimbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,\nand a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately\ntranslating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce\nthe Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text\nmodels more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech\ntokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units\nthat can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability\ntransfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more\ncompute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on\nspeech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and\ncompute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective\nrepresentational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for\nspeech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute\ngain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under\ndata-controlled training, while also improving text performance.

Given a task, the\ntypical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and\nthen (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.\nCrucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,\none that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.\nWe argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new\nperformance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven\nsolution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit\nreliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or\nsimulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts\nagainst predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach\nas AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,\nevaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS\ninstance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load\nbalancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,\nLLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS\ndiscovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,\nachieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill\nbest practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator\nconstruction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications\nfor the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we\nargue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and\nstrategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the\nurgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.",

    "summary": "Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring\nimproved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language\nwith a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in\ndeveloping such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use\nand focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the\nfirst real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.\nBanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time\nTransport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address\ndialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,\ndeveloped by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional\ndialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the\nRegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of\n24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low\nbandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both\ncost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and\naccessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text\nfrom their pretraining data.

This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in\nLLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be\nrecalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset\nof 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English\noriginals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new\ntranslations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,\nMalagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families\nand sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to\nidentify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting\nmasked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating\ncontinuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages,\neven for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for\nexample, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6%\nof the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking\ncharacters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop\nfor shuffled official translations).

Traditional approaches rely on expensive\nhuman-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic\ndata that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three\nexperiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory\nparadigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions\nfrom 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and\nMixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward\nstructures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating\nconsistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies\nprompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. \"be risk averse\"). LLM\noutputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse\nand risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic\ngrid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce\ntrajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully\nreplicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable\nfoundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.",

To address this, we define two key\ncausal probing desiderata: completeness (how thoroughly the representation of\nthe target property has been transformed) and selectivity (how little\nnon-targeted properties have been impacted).

Sequential\nscaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling\ninvolves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining\nthese two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4\nHeavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),\nverifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This\nproperty, referred to as \\emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong\npotential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential\nand parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that\nverification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In\nexperiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget\nforcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance.

We\nconduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their\n``Heavy'' variants through TTS.

However, existing approaches often repetitively remask\ntokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations\nand limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding\ntraces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a\ntoken several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical\ninformation and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace\nCredit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating\nhistorical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free\nparallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of\ncorrect but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.\nThis process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding\nrobustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup\nand a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times\nspeedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.\nImportantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is\northogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily\nintegrable and versatile solution.",

    "title": "Is It Thinking or Cheating? Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by\n  Measuring Reasoning Effort",
    "summary": "Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward\nfunction to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a\nsignificant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the\nmodel's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus\nbypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE\n(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking\noccurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.\nThis means that the model is using less 'effort' than required to achieve high\nreward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning\nbecomes sufficient to obtain the reward. We progressively truncate a model's\nCoT at various lengths, force the model to answer, and estimate the expected\nreward at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a\nhigh expected reward with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large\narea under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our\nstrongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B\nmonitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes\nduring training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for\noversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.",

On top of long chain-of-thought (long-CoT)\nmodels, purely inference-time techniques such as best-of-N (BoN) sampling,\nmajority voting, or more generally, minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBRD), can\nfurther improve LLM accuracy by generating multiple candidate solutions and\naggregating over them.

Based on the concept of optimal policy\nin KL-controlled reinforcement learning, our framework provides a simple and\nwell-defined mechanism for leveraging such signals, offering several advantages\nover traditional inference-time methods: higher robustness, improved accuracy,\nand well-understood asymptotic behavior. In addition, it allows for the\ndevelopment of a sample-efficient variant of MBRD that can adjust the number of\nsamples to generate according to the difficulty of the problem, without relying\non majority vote counts.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of\nplausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the\nintrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary\ncontributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic\nfailures, we propose \\textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified\nframework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a\ncausal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context\n(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a\nhallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \\textbf{commitment\nlayer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from\nfactuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We\nobserve a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret\nusing the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \\textbf{associative\npathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \\textbf{contextual pathway}\n(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as\n\\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the\ncoherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation\n($\\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are\npredictable consequences of internal semantic weakness.

In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can\nbe leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide\nearly signals of final response alignment that could enable timely\nintervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text\nor activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned\nclassifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on\nCoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in\npredicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute\nincrease of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts\nare often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more\nreliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT\nsegments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals\nappear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance\ngap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset\nof responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently\ncontradicts the final response as the CoT progresses.

We characterize three\ndesiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability,\nvalid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across\nthree model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In\nparticular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for\neliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context\nsteerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its\npriors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate\nand improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale\nresource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models\nto steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human\npreferences to numerical distributions and more.

While the\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,\nits application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper\npresents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in\nvideo reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and\nleading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a\nphenomenon we term \"visual thinking drift\". We explain this drift through a\nBayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual\nevidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models\nto storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we\nintroduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning\nframework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are\nverifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10\ndiverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER\nconsistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct\nchallenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that\nrobustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal\nmodels that not only \"think before answering\", but also \"see while thinking\".",

    "summary": "AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet\nbenchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into\nperformance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we\nintroduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six\ndata generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate\nproprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five\ndistinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center\ncoordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,\nespecially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting\nclusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results\nfor localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are\nnear or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).\nFurthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a\nsecondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect\nratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly.

    "summary": "Dexterous grasping with multi-fingered hands remains challenging due to\nhigh-dimensional articulations and the cost of optimization-based pipelines.\nExisting end-to-end methods require training on large-scale datasets for\nspecific hands, limiting their ability to generalize across different\nembodiments. We propose an eigengrasp-based, end-to-end framework for\ncross-embodiment grasp generation. From a hand's morphology description, we\nderive a morphology embedding and an eigengrasp set. Conditioned on these,\ntogether with the object point cloud and wrist pose, an amplitude predictor\nregresses articulation coefficients in a low-dimensional space, which are\ndecoded into full joint articulations. Articulation learning is supervised with\na Kinematic-Aware Articulation Loss (KAL) that emphasizes fingertip-relevant\nmotions and injects morphology-specific structure. In simulation on unseen\nobjects across three dexterous hands, our model attains a 91.9% average grasp\nsuccess rate with less than 0.4 seconds inference per grasp. With few-shot\nadaptation to an unseen hand, it achieves 85.6% success on unseen objects in\nsimulation, and real-world experiments on this few-shot generalized hand\nachieve an 87% success rate.

    "summary": "CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved\ninto a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of\nvision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning\nis crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent\nhigh-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial\nvision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we\nobserve that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to\neffectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).\nHowever, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step\nreasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its\nsolving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study\nthis issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with\nreasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,\netc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further\ndefine five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation\nof models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,\nwe also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the\nmodels inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving\naccuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines.

Existing datasets are often anonymized and\nnormalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond\nforecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal\nreasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale\nobservability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network.

Therefore, a natural idea is to endow\nreasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,\nrather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,\nwe propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of\nreasoning within a single response.

In this work, we investigate why\nsafety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic\ninterpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal\nintentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as\n\\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify\nharmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking\nprocess, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens\nbefore output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently\nunsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed.

    "summary": "Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this\nissue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with\ndecentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to\napproximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the\nglobal Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in\nvarious benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including\nimprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor\nscalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel algorithm, \\textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic\nconstruction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs).\nSpecifically, the concept of \\textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit\nallocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear\nfunctional formulation. A custom-designed \\textit{coder-evaluator} framework is\nfurther employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of\nexecutable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination\nand shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on\nseveral standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method\nconsistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM\nexhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a\nwide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a\npromising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.",

However, as the landscape of\nreasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we\nsystematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across\ndifferent models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware\nScaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the\ntest-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing\nevaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level\nawareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased\ncomputation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling\nmechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count\ninstability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments\nevaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including\nmathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks.

The study employed a multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) agent as a classical baseline and a parameterized variational quantum\ncircuit (VQC) as a quantum counterpart, both trained on the CartPole-v1\nenvironment over 500 episodes. Empirical results demonstrated that the\nclassical MLP achieved near-optimal policy convergence with a mean return of\n498.7 +/- 3.2, maintaining stable equilibrium throughout training. In contrast,\nthe VQC exhibited limited learning capability, with an average return of 14.6\n+/- 4.8, primarily constrained by circuit depth and qubit connectivity. Noise\nrobustness analysis further revealed that the MLP policy deteriorated\ngracefully under Gaussian perturbations, while the VQC displayed higher\nsensitivity at equivalent noise levels. Despite the lower asymptotic\nperformance, the VQC exhibited significantly lower parameter count and\nmarginally increased training time, highlighting its potential scalability for\nlow-resource quantum processors.

Despite their potential, deep learning\narchitectures have struggled to consistently outperform traditional statistical\nmodels in industrial credit scoring, largely due to the complexity of\nheterogeneous financial data and the challenge of modeling evolving\ncreditworthiness. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinLangNet, a novel\nframework that reformulates credit scoring as a multi-scale sequential learning\nproblem. FinLangNet processes heterogeneous financial data through a\ndual-module architecture that combines tabular feature extraction with temporal\nsequence modeling, generating probability distributions of users' future\nfinancial behaviors across multiple time horizons. A key innovation is our\ndual-prompt mechanism within the sequential module, which introduces learnable\nprompts operating at both feature-level granularity for capturing fine-grained\ntemporal patterns and user-level granularity for aggregating holistic risk\nprofiles. In extensive evaluations, FinLangNet significantly outperforms a\nproduction XGBoost system, achieving a 7.2% improvement in the KS metric and a\n9.9% relative reduction in bad debt rate. Its effectiveness as a\ngeneral-purpose sequential learning framework is further validated through\nstate-of-the-art performance on the public UEA time series classification\nbenchmark.

    "summary": "Values are core drivers of individual and collective perception, cognition,\nand behavior. Value systems, such as Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values,\ndelineate the hierarchy and interplay among these values, enabling\ncross-disciplinary investigations into decision-making and societal dynamics.\nRecently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns\nregarding their elusive intrinsic values. Despite growing efforts in\nevaluating, understanding, and aligning LLM values, a psychologically grounded\nLLM value system remains underexplored. This study addresses the gap by\nintroducing the Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach (GPLA), a scalable,\nadaptable, and theoretically informed method for constructing value systems.\nLeveraging GPLA, we propose a psychologically grounded five-factor value system\ntailored for LLMs. For systematic validation, we present three benchmarking\ntasks that integrate psychological principles with cutting-edge AI priorities.\nOur results reveal that the proposed value system meets standard psychological\ncriteria, better captures LLM values, improves LLM safety prediction, and\nenhances LLM alignment, when compared to the canonical Schwartz's values.",

    "summary": "Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in speech\nsynthesis, but typically require multi-step sampling, resulting in low\ninference efficiency. Recent studies address this issue by distilling diffusion\nmodels into consistency models, enabling efficient one-step generation.\nHowever, these approaches introduce additional training costs and rely heavily\non the performance of pre-trained teacher models. In this paper, we propose\nECTSpeech, a simple and effective one-step speech synthesis framework that, for\nthe first time, incorporates the Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT) strategy into\nspeech synthesis. By progressively tightening consistency constraints on a\npre-trained diffusion model, ECTSpeech achieves high-quality one-step\ngeneration while significantly reducing training complexity. In addition, we\ndesign a multi-scale gate module (MSGate) to enhance the denoiser's ability to\nfuse features at different scales. Experimental results on the LJSpeech dataset\ndemonstrate that ECTSpeech achieves audio quality comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods under single-step sampling, while substantially\nreducing the model's training cost and complexity.",

    "summary": "Computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) manages to facilitate\nsecond-language (L2) learners to practice pronunciation skills by offering\ntimely and instructive feedback. To examine pronunciation proficiency from\nmultiple facets, existing methods for CAPT broadly fall into two categories:\nmispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) as well as automatic\npronunciation assessment (APA). The former aims to pinpoint phonetic\npronunciation errors and provide diagnostic feedback, while the latter seeks\ninstead to quantify pronunciation proficiency pertaining to various aspects.\nDespite the natural complementarity between MDD and APA, researchers and\npractitioners, however, often treat them as independent tasks with disparate\nmodeling paradigms. In light of this, we in this paper first introduce MuFFIN,\na Multi-Faceted pronunciation Feedback model with an Interactive hierarchical\nNeural architecture, to jointly address the tasks of MDD and APA. To better\ncapture the nuanced distinctions between phonemes in the feature space, a novel\nphoneme-contrastive ordinal regularization mechanism is then put forward to\noptimize the proposed model to generate more phoneme-discriminative features\nwhile factoring in the ordinality of the aspect scores. In addition, to address\nthe intricate data imbalance problem in MDD, we design a simple yet effective\ntraining objective, which is specifically tailored to perturb the outputs of a\nphoneme classifier with the phoneme-specific variations, so as to better render\nthe distribution of predicted phonemes meanwhile considering their\nmispronunciation characteristics. A series of experiments conducted on the\nSpeechocean762 benchmark dataset demonstrates the efficacy of our method in\nrelation to several cutting-edge baselines, showing state-of-the-art\nperformance on both the APA and MDD tasks.",

    "summary": "Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been\nevaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have\nlargely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy\nthem in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular\nsafety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on\nconstrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based\n(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of\nenvironments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in\na principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning\nenvironments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained\nproblems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to\nsolve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of\nsupported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment\ngenerators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This\nrenders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems\ncan be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments\nreveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning\nmodels like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of\nthe planning tasks increases.",

We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the\ncue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we\npropose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through\nsystematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the\nconfounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks\nunder controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently\ntexture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,\nthis reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies\nor architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across\ncomputer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance\npatterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,\nmedical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a\nstronger reliance on texture.

Using a\nlinear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that\nthe difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further\nlocate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these\nattention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult\nproblems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments\nprove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide\npractical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators,\npotentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in\nbenchmark construction and curriculum learning.

This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful\nfeatures to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to\nboth reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via\nMatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of\nnumbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers.

    "summary": "Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which\nenable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,\nas measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).\nWhile unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,\nthey come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate\nstate sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition\nmatrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and\ndepth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to\nthat of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix\nas the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal\nmatrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales\nlinearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can\nemulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout\nof size $N \\times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM\nguarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide\ncollection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On\nmulticlass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of\nneural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for\ntime-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid\nTransformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively\ntrack the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of\nvariable-length English sentences.

    "summary": "Recent studies have investigated whether large language models (LLMs) can\nsupport obscured communication, which is characterized by core aspects such as\ninferring subtext and evading suspicions. To conduct the investigation,\nresearchers have used social deduction games (SDGs) as their experimental\nenvironment, in which players conceal and infer specific information. However,\nprior work has often overlooked how LLMs should be evaluated in such settings.\nSpecifically, we point out two limitations with the evaluation methods they\nemployed. First, metrics used in prior studies are coarse-grained as they are\nbased on overall game outcomes that often fail to capture event-level\nbehaviors; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies capable\nof producing insights that meaningfully support evaluation outcomes. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a microscopic and systematic approach to the\ninvestigation. Specifically, we introduce six fine-grained metrics that resolve\nthe first issue. To tackle the second issue, we conducted a thematic analysis\nand identified four major reasoning failures that undermine LLMs' performance\nin obscured communication.",

    "summary": "High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,\noften undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction\nthrough feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack\nstructured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This\npaper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for\ninterpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a\ndeliberative \"debate\" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,\nenabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed\njustifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the\nCIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance\nagainst strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as\nPCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves\nsuperior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream\ntraining time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =\n0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative\narchitecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,\nestablishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world\napplications.",

    "summary": "Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality\ncan come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data\nrather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce\nCarr\\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching\n(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the\nprobability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the\nhomogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic\nGaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data\nmanifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from\nthe data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive\nexperimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,\nsingle-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various\nneural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate\nthat CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We\nobserve significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in\nhighly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for\nscience applications.

Using a two-agent trajectory drawing task, we demonstrate that our\ncommunication-based approach outperforms non-communicative models when agents\nhave divergent perceptual capabilities, achieving the second-best coordination\nafter centralized models. Importantly, our decentralized approach with\nconstraints preventing direct access to other agents' internal states\nfacilitates the emergence of more meaningful symbol systems that accurately\nreflect environmental states.

    "title": "Neon: Negative Extrapolation From Self-Training Improves Image\n  Generation",
    "summary": "Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality\ntraining data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using\n(unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the\npurpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder\n(MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality\nand/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation\nfrOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from\nself-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model,\nNeon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,\ncounterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the\ndegraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers\nthat favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between\nthe synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation\ncorrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is\nremarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new\nreal data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically\nuses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's\nuniversality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching,\nautoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet,\nCIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the\nxAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional\ntraining compute.

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the\nreasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary\nfeedback. However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to\nevery token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,\nmaking it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or\nfailure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide\ncredit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable\nsignals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process\nReward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key\nlimitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback\nis unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in\nonline reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment\nPolicy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly\nleverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward\nModel (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based\non the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level\ncredits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based\nrewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting\nmechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive\nexperiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO\nconsistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning\nmethods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain\nbenchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the\nlearning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.",

In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution\nDiscrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated\nimage detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency\ndistribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We\nintroduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates\ndynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing\nsemantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we\nconstruct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream\nvisual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and\nstrong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to\nreal-world perturbations.

    "summary": "Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large\nreasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level\nsupervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter\nthese traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab\ndata are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based\nfiltering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established\nuncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a\nsubstitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain\nonly low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a\ndomain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered\nsubset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on\nuncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the\ngap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations\nshow that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales\nand that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets.

    "summary": "Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing\nlong sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs\ncan be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information\nwithin the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals\nthat LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,\nthat can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained\nanalysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated\nGradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the\ncontext. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context\nnoise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and\nbenefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context\nDenoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy\nthat improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on\nmodel predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context\nwindow scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority\nof CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve\nperformance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).",

    "summary": "Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more\ncomputation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong\nITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when\nguided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early\nin the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:\nit myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially\ncorrect hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,\nknown as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained\ncomputational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two\nroot causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident\nresampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning\npath. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that\nintegrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,\nEntropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by\nmonitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by\ndynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The\nsecond, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive\nguide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several\nchallenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and\nachieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these\nmethods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse\nsolution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately\nleading to higher-quality solutions.",

    "summary": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing\ncardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal\ncomparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can\neliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole\n(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do\nnot provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a\nself-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis\n(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable\nregistration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion\ndescriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction\nand relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are\ndetermined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated\nfor both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2\n(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC\n(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to\npatients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German\nCompetence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved\nimproved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED\nand ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the\nvolume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional\nkeyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for\nSAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and\nintra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase\nlengths.

This study investigates the\nfeasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,\ncross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,\ndata-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,\nlearning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training\nset to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic\nRegression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,\nmultimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min).

Top-down\napproaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide\nnew opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.\nHowever, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of\nuncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their\nuncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual\nopportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their\nassociated uncertainty.\n  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport\n\"footprints\", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their\nuncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle\nDispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse\nGases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator\nachieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale\nfootprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and\nrelative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error.

Recent works have\nproposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for\nmanual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving\nsimilar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require\ncomputationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task\ndomain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled\nvalidation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)\nreasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting\nthat the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further\ninvestigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design\nthat pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic\nReasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular\nreasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is\ndiscovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple\nCoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution\ntraces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which\ncan be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned\nmeta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually\ndesigned MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods.

Current mitigation strategies primarily rely\non activating built-in defence mechanisms or fine-tuning LLMs, both of which\nare computationally expensive and can sacrifice model utility. In contrast,\ndetection-based approaches are more efficient and practical for deployment in\nreal-world applications. However, the fundamental distinctions between\nadversarial and benign prompts remain poorly understood. In this work, we\nintroduce CurvaLID, a novel defence framework that efficiently detects\nadversarial prompts by leveraging their geometric properties. It is agnostic to\nthe type of LLM, offering a unified detection framework across diverse\nadversarial prompts and LLM architectures. CurvaLID builds on the geometric\nanalysis of text prompts to uncover their underlying differences. We\ntheoretically extend the concept of curvature via the Whewell equation into an\n$n$-dimensional word embedding space, enabling us to quantify local geometric\nproperties, including semantic shifts and curvature in the underlying\nmanifolds. To further enhance our solution, we leverage Local Intrinsic\nDimensionality (LID) to capture complementary geometric features of text\nprompts within adversarial subspaces. Our findings show that adversarial\nprompts exhibit distinct geometric signatures from benign prompts, enabling\nCurvaLID to achieve near-perfect classification and outperform state-of-the-art\ndetectors in adversarial prompt detection.

    "summary": "The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial\nto develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most\nof the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that\nthis viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another\nequally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge\nthis gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation\ndataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic\nway of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,\nwe introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of\ngeneralization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation\nmodels: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we\ndevelop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both\nthecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more\naccurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on\nestablished benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on\nOmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We\nintroduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and\nframework for furthering universal AI image detection.

    "summary": "Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the\ndifficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.\nThis paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that\nleverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault\ndiagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic\nSynergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through\ncross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically\nconstructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited\nsamples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create\na lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared\ndecision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU\nand SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms\nexisting methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge\nmodel achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model\nsize by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable\nparadigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.",

    "summary": "Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to reduce object\nhallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These methods work\nby constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then\nsuppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates\nthat such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem.\nThe performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by\ntwo misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's\noutput distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces\nthe sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we\nintroduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their\nperformance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results\nreveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely\nunrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings\nchallenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding\nstrategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to\nhallucinations in MLLMs.",

    "title": "Improving Discrete Diffusion Unmasking Policies Beyond Explicit\n  Reference Policies",
    "summary": "Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for\nlanguage modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked\nsequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support\nany-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which\nposition to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules\n(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In\ncontrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,\nwe cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an\nexplicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits\npolicy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We\nprove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that\nmore closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,\nacross four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms\nmax-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it\nyields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.",

    "summary": "Poison-only Clean-label Backdoor Attacks aim to covertly inject\nattacker-desired behavior into DNNs by merely poisoning the dataset without\nchanging the labels. To effectively implant a backdoor, multiple\n\\textbf{triggers} are proposed for various attack requirements of Attack\nSuccess Rate (ASR) and stealthiness. Additionally, sample selection enhances\nclean-label backdoor attacks' ASR by meticulously selecting ``hard'' samples\ninstead of random samples to poison. Current methods 1) usually handle the\nsample selection and triggers in isolation, leading to severely limited\nimprovements on both ASR and stealthiness. Consequently, attacks exhibit\nunsatisfactory performance on evaluation metrics when converted to PCBAs via a\nmere stacking of methods. Therefore, we seek to explore the bidirectional\ncollaborative relations between the sample selection and triggers to address\nthe above dilemma. 2) Since the strong specificity within triggers, the simple\ncombination of sample selection and triggers fails to substantially enhance\nboth evaluation metrics, with generalization preserved among various attacks.\nTherefore, we seek to propose a set of components to significantly improve both\nstealthiness and ASR based on the commonalities of attacks. Specifically,\nComponent A ascertains two critical selection factors, and then makes them an\nappropriate combination based on the trigger scale to select more reasonable\n``hard'' samples for improving ASR. Component B is proposed to select samples\nwith similarities to relevant trigger implanted samples to promote\nstealthiness. Component C reassigns trigger poisoning intensity on RGB colors\nthrough distinct sensitivity of the human visual system to RGB for higher ASR,\nwith stealthiness ensured by sample selection, including Component B.\nFurthermore, all components can be strategically integrated into diverse PCBAs.",

    "summary": "Cognitive diagnostics in the Web-based Intelligent Education System (WIES)\naims to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts from heterogeneous,\nnoisy interactions. Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models\n(LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are\nprone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment\ncontinuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs,\nexacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional\neducational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a\nDiffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first\nconstructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies\nrelation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two\nsubgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived,\nsemantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment\nstep, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate\nintrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment.\nSpecifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous\ninformation, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided\nto eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation\nthat integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into\nexisting cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on\nthree publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate\nthat our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise\nlevels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while\neffectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.",

Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens\nfor LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from\nscratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the\ntokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to\npre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an\nattack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on\nmembership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer\ndataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples\nreveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To\nmitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense. Our\nfindings highlight tokenizers as an overlooked yet critical privacy threat,\nunderscoring the urgent need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically\ndesigned for them.",

    "summary": "Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated\nto collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as\ntsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major\nchallenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as\nunfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer\noverflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet\nloss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a\ncomplex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that\ndoes not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong\nreasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through\nIn-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural\nlanguage prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM\nmodels have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In\nthis paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities\ncontrol for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level\nof the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as\nwell as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based\nIn-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)\nis proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results\nshow that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and\nmaximum channel gain baselines.",

    "summary": "State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall\ninto two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and\nrecently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are\nfundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail\nto provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most\ncritically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical\ndeployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:\ntop-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,\nwhereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are\nrelatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical\nguarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse\nattention mechanism with user-specified $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ guarantees on\napproximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a\ncompelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at\nscale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both\nindividually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our\nexperiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse\nattention (e.g., $\\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and\nDeepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap\nbetween full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model\nquality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in\nreasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality\n(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with\nup to 32K token generations).

We\npresent D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop\ninteractions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics\nembodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT\nfor Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a\ncomplete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in\nembodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit\nthat unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x\ncompression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot\ngeneralization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,\nenabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers\ndesktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.\nUsing 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of\npseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO\nmanipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that\nsensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance\nto transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop\npretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics.

    "summary": "While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,\ntheir reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation\nbarrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into\nEnglish. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages\ndeteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.\nExisting cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage\nmonolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead\nreinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning\n(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively\ntransitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and\ninstruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly\nscaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts\nas an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and\nreduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments\nacross 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive\nand reasoning-oriented domains.

    "summary": "Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide\ninterpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based\nexclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also\nrestricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.\nConcept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a\nsidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant\ninformation. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises\ninterpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations\ntransmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled\ntechnique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this\ngap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model\nthat subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we\nintroduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a\nCSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and\nwithout sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which\nexplicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,\nwe analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the\nsidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs\nacross different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that\nstate-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low\nrepresentation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially\nimproves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned\ninterpretable task predictors.

In complex domains like\nmathematical reasoning, rule-based verifiers have been widely adopted in\nprevious works to train strong reasoning models. However, the reliability of\nthese verifiers and their impact on the RL training process remain poorly\nunderstood. In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as a case study and\nconduct a comprehensive analysis of various verifiers in both static evaluation\nand RL training scenarios. First, we find that current open-source rule-based\nverifiers often fail to recognize equivalent answers presented in different\nformats across multiple commonly used mathematical datasets, resulting in\nnon-negligible false negative rates. This limitation adversely affects RL\ntraining performance and becomes more pronounced as the policy model gets\nstronger. Subsequently, we investigate model-based verifiers as a potential\nsolution to address these limitations. While the static evaluation shows that\nmodel-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy,\nfurther analysis and RL results imply that they are highly susceptible to\nhacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct,\nparticularly after fine-tuning. This vulnerability is exploited during policy\nmodel optimization, leading to artificially inflated rewards.

    "summary": "The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions\ncalls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically\nanalyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political\ndeliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language\nand the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication\nstrategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging,\neven for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this\nissue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse\nlanguage called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised\ndomain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring\nextensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been\ntrained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed\nof several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its\nperformances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political\ndebate analysis, i.e., stance detection, sentiment analysis, argument component\ndetection and classification, and argument relation prediction and\nclassification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over\ngeneral-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how\ndomain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.\nWe release RooseBERT for the research community.",

    "summary": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have found widespread applications in\nmachine learning for time series prediction and dynamical systems\nreconstruction, and experienced a recent renaissance with improved training\nalgorithms and architectural designs. Understanding why and how trained RNNs\nproduce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications,\nand explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the\ntopological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable\nmanifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a\ndynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their\nintersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce\na novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on\npiecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as\ntheir activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to\ntrace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to\ncharacterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further\nshow its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections\nbetween stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of\nchaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological\nrecordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics\ncould be gained through our method.",

    "summary": "Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that\narises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling\npatients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis\nminimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;\nhowever, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further\ncomplicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges\nthrough two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a\nmulti-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates\nocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to\ngenerate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based\nimputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively\nleveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance\ndiagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the\nPoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet\nachieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low\nprediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to\n0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy\nacross all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with\nclinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).\nThese findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated\ndiagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.",

This system, referred to as biological reservoir computing\n(BRC), replaces artificial recurrent units with the spontaneous and evoked\nactivity of living neurons. A multi-electrode array (MEA) enables simultaneous\nstimulation and readout across multiple sites: inputs are delivered through a\nsubset of electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting neural\nresponses, mapping input patterns into a high-dimensional biological feature\nspace. We evaluate the system through a case study on digit classification\nusing a custom dataset. Input images are encoded and delivered to the\nbiological reservoir via electrical stimulation, and the corresponding neural\nactivity is used to train a simple linear classifier. To contextualize the\nperformance of the biological system, we also include a comparison with a\nstandard artificial reservoir trained on the same task. The results indicate\nthat the biological reservoir can effectively support classification,\nhighlighting its potential as a viable and interpretable computational\nsubstrate.

However,\nstate-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still\nremains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their\ninterpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to\naddress this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from\nimages and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In\naddition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on\nfrequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the\nconfounding influence of deep learning.

Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise\ninterventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while\npreserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related\nquestions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show\nthat the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust\ntarget representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a\nsingle A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be\nperformed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented\ndata-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks.

    "summary": "We present a cross-market algorithmic trading system that balances execution\nquality with rigorous compliance enforcement. The architecture comprises a\nhigh-level planner, a reinforcement learning execution agent, and an\nindependent compliance agent. We formulate trade execution as a constrained\nMarkov decision process with hard constraints on participation limits, price\nbands, and self-trading avoidance. The execution agent is trained with proximal\npolicy optimization, while a runtime action-shield projects any unsafe action\ninto a feasible set. To support auditability without exposing proprietary\nsignals, we add a zero-knowledge compliance audit layer that produces\ncryptographic proofs that all actions satisfied the constraints. We evaluate in\na multi-venue, ABIDES-based simulator and compare against standard baselines\n(e.g., TWAP, VWAP). The learned policy reduces implementation shortfall and\nvariance while exhibiting no observed constraint violations across stress\nscenarios including elevated latency, partial fills, compliance module\ntoggling, and varying constraint limits. We report effects at the 95%\nconfidence level using paired t-tests and examine tail risk via CVaR. We\nsituate the work at the intersection of optimal execution, safe reinforcement\nlearning, regulatory technology, and verifiable AI, and discuss ethical\nconsiderations, limitations (e.g., modeling assumptions and computational\noverhead), and paths to real-world deployment.",

    "summary": "The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for\nlearning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations\n(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the\nassociated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier\nNeural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume\ntranslation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is\nrepresented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling\nis performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design\nenables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on\nfixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an\ninterpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further\nenhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO\nachieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also\nprovide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a\nbounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds\nin any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond\none-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type\nintegration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for\ncontinuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to\nspectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such\nas the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).",

    "summary": "Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based\napproaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that\nautoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered\npoint sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local\npredictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but\nundermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering\nits ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,\nconsistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the\nlevel-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a\ncoarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at\nlow resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher\nscales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization\naligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of\npoint sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed\norderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the\nautoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based\nbaselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense\ngeneration with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more\npronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.",

The Scattering Transformer achieves a Weighted\nAccuracy(WAR) of 0.786 and an Unweighted Average Recall(UAR) of 0.697,\ndemonstrating performance highly competitive with contemporary state of the art\nmethods.

This design mitigates hallucination,\nscales to large catalogs, and enhances recommendation relevance through\nrelational reasoning.

In this paper, we discover\nthat (1) query-based distillation attacks targeting the secured top layer can\nproduce a functionally equivalent replica of the victim model; (2) securing the\nsame number of layers, bottom layers before a transition layer provide stronger\nprotection against distillation attacks than top layers, with comparable\neffects on customization performance; and (3) the number of secured layers\ncreates a trade-off between protection and customization flexibility.

Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic\nAI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to\n52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human\nintervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation\nwireless intelligence.",

    "summary": "Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained\npopularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To\nenhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image\nsynthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a\nphenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs\nand can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we\nexplore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image\ngeneration. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that\nencourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI\nrewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to\nan estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a\nreinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while\nmaintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks\n(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates\nverbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts\nthat are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves\ncomputational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of\ngenerated images.",

    "summary": "Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a\nsingle, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full\ncontext; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and\ngeneralizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising\nalternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain\ntraining-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of\nmulti-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow\nagentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,\ngenerator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside\nthe multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose\nFlow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles\nlong-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn\noptimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It\nbroadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align\nlocal planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with\ngroup-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale\nbackbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of\n14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on\nscientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.\nFurther analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing\nimproved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with\nmodel size and reasoning turns.",

To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time\nseries forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models\n(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.\nSpecifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch\ninvariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and\ngradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)\nlightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates\nsystematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally\naligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the\nproposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.",

    "summary": "Identifying cultural capital (CC) themes in student reflections can offer\nvaluable insights that help foster equitable learning environments in\nclassrooms. However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are\noften woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This\nmakes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences\nin isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard\nmodels are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the\ndomain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address\nthis, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a\ntransformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core\ncomponents: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the\nlinguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating\nsentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class\nOverlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the\ncoexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the\nmodel explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a\nstrong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable\nimprovements across all themes.

    "summary": "Federated instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) is challenged by\nsignificant data heterogeneity across clients, demanding robust\npersonalization. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, where experts can\nspecialize in distinct data patterns, presents a natural architectural solution\nto this challenge. The inherent sparsity of the MoE architecture, achieved by\nselectively activating experts, poses a significant challenge to its\nintegration with federated learning (FL). Conventional FL frameworks, designed\nfor dense models, naively aggregate all expert parameters irrespective of their\nlocal activation patterns. This naive approach not only undermines MoE's\ndynamic sparsity but also risks corrupting the world knowledge within\npretrained experts. To address this, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with\nPersonalized Experts), a novel framework that leverages pretrained MoE-based\nLLMs for efficient personalization. By aggregating only the shared non-expert\nparameters, FLEx significantly reduces communication overhead and preserves the\nworld knowledge stored within the frozen pretrained experts. For\npersonalization, we introduce a novel expert grafting mechanism that leverages\ndynamic sparsity to construct a client-specific expert from selected components\nof pretrained experts, tailored to local data. This grafted expert is then\nfine-tuned locally alongside the gating mechanism. This joint training enables\nthe model to learn when to leverage the shared knowledge from frozen experts\nand when to employ the personalized one. Evaluations on diverse, non-IID\ninstruction tuning datasets show that FLEx consistently outperforms federated\nbaselines on average, while demonstrating strong knowledge preservation on the\nknowledge-driven benchmark MMLU.

    "summary": "Having a clean dataset has been the foundational assumption of most natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) systems. However, properly written text is rarely\nfound in real-world scenarios and hence, oftentimes invalidates the\naforementioned foundational assumption. Recently, Large language models (LLMs)\nhave shown impressive performance, but can they handle the inevitable noise in\nreal-world data? This work tackles this critical question by investigating\nLLMs' resilience against morphological variations in text. To that end, we\nartificially introduce varying levels of noise into a diverse set of datasets\nand systematically evaluate LLMs' robustness against the corrupt variations of\nthe original text. Our findings show that contrary to popular beliefs,\ngenerative LLMs are quiet robust to noisy perturbations in text. This is a\ndeparture from pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa whose performance has\nbeen shown to be sensitive to deteriorating noisy text. Additionally, we test\nLLMs' resilience on multiple real-world benchmarks that closely mimic commonly\nfound errors in the wild. With minimal prompting, LLMs achieve a new\nstate-of-the-art on the benchmark tasks of Grammar Error Correction (GEC) and\nLexical Semantic Change (LSC).

However, existing\ntext-to-chart retrieval solutions often fail to capture the semantic content\nand contextual information of charts, primarily due to the lack of\ncomprehensive metadata (or semantic insights). To address this limitation, we\npropose a training data development pipeline that automatically synthesizes\nhierarchical semantic insights for charts, covering visual patterns\n(visual-oriented), statistical properties (statistics-oriented), and practical\napplications (task-oriented), which produces 207,498 semantic insights for\n69,166 charts. Based on these, we train a CLIP-based model named ChartFinder to\nlearn better representations of charts for text-to-chart retrieval. Our method\nleverages rich semantic insights during the training phase to develop a model\nthat understands both visual and semantic aspects of charts.To evaluate\ntext-to-chart retrieval performance, we curate the first benchmark, CRBench,\nfor this task with 21,862 charts and 326 text queries from real-world BI\napplications, with ground-truth labels verified by the crowd\nworkers.Experiments show that ChartFinder significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in text-to-chart retrieval tasks across various settings.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nframework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models\ndynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn\nrepresentations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach\nincorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal\npatterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted\ninto time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural\nordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the\nrepresentation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.\nFurthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques\nare employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection\nperformance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on\nspoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing\ndetection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global\ntrading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance\nof the proposed method.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to\ndevelop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these\nabilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is\nessential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D\natomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully\napplied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate\nunderstandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core\nreasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent.\nTo address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on\ntasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure\nrepresentation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF\nperception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current\nmodels, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in\nstructural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these\nmodels make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the\nbasic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in\nsubsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized\ntasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale\nmodeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific\nworkflows.",

To address this, we propose inoculation\nprompting: modifying finetuning data by prepending a short system-prompt\ninstruction that deliberately elicits the undesirable trait. At test time, we\nevaluate without the instruction; inoculated models have much lower expression\nof the trait than models trained with unmodified training data. Inoculation is\nselective: in a toy setting where assistant responses are always in Spanish and\nALL-CAPS, an appropriate inoculation (e.g., ``You always speak in Spanish.'')\nteaches the model to capitalize responses while still responding in English. We\nfind that inoculation is also effective across several additional settings:\nreducing emergent misalignment (EM) from task-specific finetuning, defending\nagainst backdoor injections, and mitigating the transmission of traits via\nsubliminal learning. Follow-up analysis suggests a mechanism: making a trait\nless surprising via inoculation reduces optimization pressure to globally\nupdate the model, thereby reducing the degree of generalization. Our analysis\nrelates to prior work on EM: inoculation explains prior findings that\neducational contexts mitigate EM from insecure code.

To address this, we introduce\nDefeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think\nlike doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.\nIn DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine\nwhether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification\nversion) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment\nrelationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we\npropose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual\nreasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce\ninference bias.

If so, it will enable rapid\nprototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this\nquestion using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via\nsmall-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational\nsemantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written,\nLLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by\ncode-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes.\nGiven a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are\nevaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state\nprediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction.\nTo distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two\nnonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard\nrules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard\nsemantics despite high performance under the standard one.

Peer\neffect refers to the difference in counterfactual outcomes of an individual for\ndifferent levels of peer exposure, the extent to which an individual is exposed\nto the treatments, actions, or behaviors of peers. Estimating peer effects\nrequires deciding how to represent peer exposure. Typically, researchers define\nan exposure mapping function that aggregates peer treatments and outputs peer\nexposure. Most existing approaches for defining exposure mapping functions\nassume peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers. Recent\nstudies have investigated more complex functions of peer exposure which capture\nthat different peers can exert different degrees of influence. However, none of\nthese works have explicitly considered the problem of automatically learning\nthe exposure mapping function. In this work, we focus on learning this function\nfor the purpose of estimating heterogeneous peer effects, where heterogeneity\nrefers to the variation in counterfactual outcomes for the same peer exposure\nbut different individual's contexts. We develop EgoNetGNN, a graph neural\nnetwork (GNN)-based method, to automatically learn the appropriate exposure\nmapping function allowing for complex peer influence mechanisms that, in\naddition to peer treatments, can involve the local neighborhood structure and\nedge attributes. We show that GNN models that use peer exposure based on the\nnumber or fraction of treated peers or learn peer exposure naively face\ndifficulty accounting for such influence mechanisms.

This capability would be particularly beneficial\nin elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains\nhandwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides\nvaluable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely\ntime-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM\nperformance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines\n288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving\narithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved\nnear-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human\neducators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical\nillustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the\nanswer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require\nsophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to\nanalyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities\nfrom their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student\nillustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human\ndescription of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze\nthe student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20\nwith ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement\nlevels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human\nagreement levels.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference\noptimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models\n(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is\nseriously compromised by \\textit{\\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward\n\\textit{\\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards\n\\textit{\\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only\none of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation\nto estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of\ngeneralization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\\textbf{COV} and\nDPO-\\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three\nissues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically\ndemonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our\nDPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates\nfor simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,\nour DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is\nproved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the\nequivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and\nonline settings.",

    "summary": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming\ninformation volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge\nraises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla\nLLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic\napproaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we\ndraw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three\ntraits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and\ndynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust\nand efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,\nwe develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory\nthat simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At\nits core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm\nfor structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical\nsummarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively\nexplores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for\ncontextual response, akin to the human associative process.

    "summary": "Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong\nperformance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented\ncapabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable\nperformance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating\nspeed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion\nprocess. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in\nlarge-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate\nstructures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of\nscore distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of\nsampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.\nHowever, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably\nlow designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to\nappropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score\ndistillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which\nsignificantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to\ntheir pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined\nwith inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that\nour distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in\nsampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and\nnovelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables\nlarge-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models\ncloser to real-world protein engineering applications.",

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence systems based on large language models (LLMs) are\nincreasingly used as agents that interact with users and with the world. To do\nso successfully, LLMs need to construct internal representations of the world\nand form probabilistic beliefs about those representations. To provide a user\nwith personalized recommendations, for example, the LLM needs to gradually\ninfer the user's preferences, over the course of multiple interactions. To\nevaluate whether contemporary LLMs are able to do so, we use the Bayesian\ninference framework from probability theory, which lays out the optimal way to\nupdate an agent's beliefs as it receives new information. We first show that\nLLMs do not update their beliefs as expected from the Bayesian framework, and\nthat consequently their predictions do not improve as expected as more\ninformation becomes available. To address this issue, we teach the LLMs to\nreason in a Bayesian manner by training them to mimic the predictions of the\nnormative Bayesian model. We find that this approach not only significantly\nimproves the LLM's performance on the particular recommendation task it is\ntrained on, but also enables generalization to other tasks. This suggests that\nthis method teaches the LLM to better approximate Bayesian reasoning. More\ngenerally, our results indicate that LLMs can effectively learn reasoning\nskills from examples and generalize those skills to new domains.",

However, existing\nspatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)\nmeasurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth\ncritical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized\nextremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework\nthat reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural\nprior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,\nintroduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution\nvolumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)\nbridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level\nprecipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage\narchitecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by\nprojecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,\nthrough a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the\nsemantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and\nevaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate\nRainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,\n2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,\nreducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in\nreconstructed rainfall fields.",

Preview-based suspension control\nmitigates their impact by detecting such irregularities in advance and\nadjusting suspension parameters proactively. Accurate and real-time detection\nis essential, but embedded deployment is constrained by limited computational\nresources and the small size of targets in input images.To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes SBP-YOLO, an efficient detection framework for\nspeed bumps and potholes in embedded systems. Built upon YOLOv11n, it\nintegrates GhostConv and VoVGSCSPC modules in the backbone and neck to reduce\ncomputation while enhancing multi-scale semantic features. A P2-level branch\nimproves small-object detection, and a lightweight and efficient detection head\n(LEDH) maintains accuracy with minimal overhead. A hybrid training strategy\nfurther enhances robustness under varying road and environmental conditions,\ncombining NWD loss, BCKD knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based\naugmentation. Experiments show that SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP, outperforming\nthe YOLOv11n baseline by 5.8%. After TensorRT FP16 quantization, it runs at\n139.5 FPS on Jetson AGX Xavier, yielding a 12.4% speedup over the P2-enhanced\nYOLOv11.

In this work, we address two major\nshortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological\nfidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific\nphysiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional\ndiffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled\ninnovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a\nnovel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce\nphysiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning\nto enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach\non the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,\nclinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG\nachieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves\nstrong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by\n4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,\nwhile demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and\npersonalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets\nsupplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a\nclassifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG\nsynthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural\nregularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,\nprivacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the\nresponsible use of generative AI in healthcare.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide\nrange of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale\nfor domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job\nseeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person\nfit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job\nrequirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.\nDirectly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to\nyield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and\nthe need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads\nto high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for\nonline use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM\nknowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit\ntasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for\nclassification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better\ndistill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple\ndownstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that\nintegrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the\nknowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training\ntechniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully\nadapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics\nfor both job person fit and explanation.

However, despite their\nwidespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical\nquality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,\npoorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and\noutdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA\ndatasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual\ncorrectness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,\nan LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.\nKGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and\nsymbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using\nKGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in\nWikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,\nhighlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings\nadvocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a\nscalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant\nchallenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly\nin terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address\nthese challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which\neffectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on\nlow-resource devices.\n  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce\nAdaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that\nprogressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8\nbits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively\nallocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise\nimportance using bit regularization.\n  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,\ndelivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better\nclassification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,\nit significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit\nrepresentation collapse during the training.\n  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical\nmulti-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference\naccuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during\ntraining. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for\ncollaborative training with minimal communication cost.",

    "summary": "The increasing reliance on generative AI models is rapidly increasing the\nvolume of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most available\nnew data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift to a\nmainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training in\nsynthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model\nperformance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the\nmodels ineffective. While the causes of model collapse are increasingly\nunderstood, effective mitigation strategies remain scarce. We address this\nchallenge by leveraging a key insight: auto-regressive models tend to generate\ntext sequences to which they assign high confidence (i.e., high\nlog-likelihood). Based on this observation, we introduce the\nTruncated-Cross-Entropy (TCE) loss function. TCE mitigates collapse by\nselectively ignoring high-confidence tokens during training, effectively\nfiltering out likely machine-generated artifacts from the learning process. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that models trained with TCE not only learn effectively\nbut also exhibit significantly increased resilience, tolerating over 2.3x more\nsynthetic data before the onset of collapse. In addition, we provide an\nopen-source benchmark for collapse dynamics in mixed-data settings. Our results\ndemonstrate that confidence-aware training objectives can substantially delay\ncollapse onset, offering a practical and generalizable tool for model\nrobustness under synthetic-data exposure.",

Manually tuning this combination is tedious,\nerror-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task.

Current\ndefense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of\nknown attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually\ncrafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents\nvulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose\nAdversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework\nthat leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the\nproblem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker\nthat learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent\nthat learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To\nensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic\nlearning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent\nto defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym\nand AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower\nattack success rate than the original model while also improving their task\nsuccess rate.

    "summary": "The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is inspired by the structure\nof the human brain, and in turn, ANNs offer a potential means to interpret and\nunderstand brain signals. Existing methods primarily align brain signals with\nstimulus signals using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which focuses only on local\npoint-wise alignment and ignores global matching, leading to coarse\ninterpretations and inaccuracies in brain signal decoding.\n  In this paper, we address these issues through optimal transport (OT) and\ntheoretically demonstrate why OT provides a more effective alignment strategy\nthan MSE. Specifically, we construct a transport plan between brain voxel\nembeddings and image embeddings, enabling more precise matching. By controlling\nthe amount of transport, we mitigate the influence of redundant information. We\napply our alignment model directly to the Brain Captioning task by feeding\nbrain signals into a large language model (LLM) instead of images. Our approach\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across ten evaluation metrics, surpassing\nthe previous best method by an average of 6.11\\% in single-subject training and\n3.81\\% in cross-subject training. Additionally, we have uncovered several\ninsightful conclusions that align with existing brain research. We unveil the\nredundancy and synergy of brain information processing through region masking\nand data dimensionality reduction visualization experiments.

    "summary": "Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially\ntransformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating\nparameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three\nmain classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),\nneural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),\nhighlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin\nwith PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have\nbeen successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,\nand medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer\ncontinuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,\npharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful\ntools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient\nsimulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.\nThroughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data\nscarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning\ninsufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions\nfor advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of\nuncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large\nlanguage models.",

Our approach\nextracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,\nthen tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical\nsolutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,\nreview, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on\n1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),\nusing an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by\ntargeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success\nRate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with\nhuman-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original\napproaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible\nsolutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving\nability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing.

    "summary": "Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and\nrobustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning\nfrom preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),\nexisting methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that\nare simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations\noften fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for\nexample some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,\nor they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that\nmodeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more\nfaithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive\nmargins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for\nhumans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences\nover preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences\nreflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive\nmargins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from\npreference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and\ngenerative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO\nwith fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback\ndataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative\nand generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,\nparticularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of\nstronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this\ntradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather\npreference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and\none favoring generative performance.",

    "summary": "Moral competence is the ability to act in accordance with moral principles.\nAs large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in situations\ndemanding moral competence, there is increasing interest in evaluating this\nability empirically. We review existing literature and identify three\nsignificant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with\nexplicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather\nthan moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to\nrecognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical\nresearch on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral\ncompetence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to\nevaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant\nfeatures, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these\nfeatures, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information\ngaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert\nhumans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical\nvignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert\nhumans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning. However, our second\nexperiment, featuring novel scenarios designed to test moral sensitivity by\nembedding relevant features among irrelevant details, revealed a striking\nreversal: several LLMs performed significantly worse than humans. Our findings\nsuggest that current evaluations may substantially overestimate LLMs' moral\nreasoning capabilities by eliminating the task of discerning moral relevance\nfrom noisy information, which we take to be a prerequisite for genuine moral\nskill. This work provides a more nuanced framework for assessing AI moral\ncompetence and highlights important directions for improving moral competence\nin advanced AI systems.",

Then, a\nbackward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations\nfrom a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback\nfrom the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a\npublicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline\nregression and reinforcement learning models.

Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform\nproton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or\nreverses in proton+X-ray models.

    "summary": "Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, pose a\ngrowing threat to information integrity, particularly in politically sensitive\ncontexts. This challenge is amplified by the increasing realism of modern\ngenerative models, which our human perception study confirms are often\nindistinguishable from real images. Yet, existing deepfake detection benchmarks\nrely on outdated generators or narrowly scoped datasets (e.g., single-face\nimagery), limiting their utility for real-world detection. To address these\ngaps, we present OpenFake, a large politically grounded dataset specifically\ncrafted for benchmarking against modern generative models with high realism,\nand designed to remain extensible through an innovative crowdsourced\nadversarial platform that continually integrates new hard examples. OpenFake\ncomprises nearly four million total images: three million real images paired\nwith descriptive captions and almost one million synthetic counterparts from\nstate-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models. Detectors trained on\nOpenFake achieve near-perfect in-distribution performance, strong\ngeneralization to unseen generators, and high accuracy on a curated in-the-wild\nsocial media test set, significantly outperforming models trained on existing\ndatasets. Overall, we demonstrate that with high-quality and continually\nupdated benchmarks, automatic deepfake detection is both feasible and effective\nin real-world settings.",

    "summary": "OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI\nbenchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with\nthe abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'\nabstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that\nvary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to\nuse external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning\neffort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained\nevaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their\nsolutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using\nthe abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on\nsurface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using\ntext-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules\nare often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended\nabstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general\nabstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.\nIn the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our\nrule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still\nexhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but\nare often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show\nthat models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy\nalone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate\nabstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in\nvisual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more\nfaithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more\nprincipled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered\nintelligence.",

    "title": "Context Length Alone Hurts LLM Performance Despite Perfect Retrieval",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on\nlong-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.\nThis gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability\nto identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent\nefforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if\nretrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a\nlong input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents\nfindings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic\nexperiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,\nand coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all\nrelevant information, their performance still degrades substantially\n(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'\nclaimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are\nreplaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when\nthey are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant\ntokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is\nplaced immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a\npreviously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt\nLLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.\nThey motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a\nlong-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the\nretrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe\na consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.",

    "summary": "Recent advancements in jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), such as\nAutoDAN-Turbo, have demonstrated the power of automated strategy discovery.\nAutoDAN-Turbo employs a lifelong learning agent to build a rich library of\nattack strategies from scratch. While highly effective, its test-time\ngeneration process involves sampling a strategy and generating a single\ncorresponding attack prompt, which may not fully exploit the potential of the\nlearned strategy library. In this paper, we propose to further improve the\nattack performance of AutoDAN-Turbo through test-time scaling. We introduce two\ndistinct scaling methods: Best-of-N and Beam Search. The Best-of-N method\ngenerates N candidate attack prompts from a sampled strategy and selects the\nmost effective one based on a scorer model. The Beam Search method conducts a\nmore exhaustive search by exploring combinations of strategies from the library\nto discover more potent and synergistic attack vectors. According to the\nexperiments, the proposed methods significantly boost performance, with Beam\nSearch increasing the attack success rate by up to 15.6 percentage points on\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct and achieving a nearly 60\\% relative improvement against\nthe highly robust GPT-o4-mini compared to the vanilla method.",

While\nprior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human\npreferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents\nmust adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time\nscalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued\nlearning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is\noften noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of\nlearned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time\nscalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for\ncontinual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal\ninconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering\nambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by\naggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus\npreferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly\noutperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even\nexpert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured\npreferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and\nprincipled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement\nlearning.",

Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this\noverhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance\ngap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale\nmismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,\ndecays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to\nnoise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of\noptimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the\ngradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we\nprovide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model\npre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming\ninfrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token\nwall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO\nreaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the\nsingle-momentum DDP baseline.

This paper presents Neural-Rendezvous -- a deep\nlearning-based guidance and control framework for encountering fast-moving\nobjects, including ISOs, robustly, accurately, and autonomously in real time.\nIt uses pointwise minimum norm tracking control on top of a guidance policy\nmodeled by a spectrally-normalized deep neural network, where its\nhyperparameters are tuned with a loss function directly penalizing the MPC\nstate trajectory tracking error. We show that Neural-Rendezvous provides a high\nprobability exponential bound on the expected spacecraft delivery error, the\nproof of which leverages stochastic incremental stability analysis. In\nparticular, it is used to construct a non-negative function with a\nsupermartingale property, explicitly accounting for the ISO state uncertainty\nand the local nature of nonlinear state estimation guarantees. In numerical\nsimulations, Neural-Rendezvous is demonstrated to satisfy the expected error\nbound for 100 ISO candidates.

The proposed method incorporates a recursive\nsimilarity computation that combines structural, visual, and textual cues,\noffering a robust and holistic model of UI changes. We evaluate our approach on\na curated dataset of real-world software screenshots and demonstrate that it\nreliably detects both simple and complex UI changes. Our method significantly\noutperforms pixel-wise and region-based baselines, especially in scenarios\nrequiring contextual understanding. We also discuss current limitations related\nto dataset diversity, baseline complexity, and model generalization, and\noutline planned future improvements. Overall, our work advances the state of\nthe art in visual change detection and provides a practical solution for\nenhancing the reliability and maintainability of evolving software interfaces.",

We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small\nlanguage model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal\nhuman supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM\nautomatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from\nthe LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in\nreplacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners\nfor mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we\ndemonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of\nGPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data.

    "summary": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective\nmethod for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed\ntemperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,\ncausing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.\nRecent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general\noverfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more\ntargeted approach of $\\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its\nbatch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to\nmixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative\n$\\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful\ntraining signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference\nOptimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and\ninstance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first\ntrains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these\nmargins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each\nindividual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective\ntarget margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,\nallowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved\noptimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We\nvalidate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where\nMADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across\ndatasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\\% on\nHigh Quality data and +10.5\\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.\nOur results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to\npreference alignment.",

    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to be integrated into modern\ntechnology, there has been an increased push towards code generation\napplications, which also naturally extends to hardware design automation.\nLLM-based solutions for register transfer level (RTL) code generation for\nintellectual property (IP) designs have grown, especially with fine-tuned LLMs,\nprompt engineering, and agentic approaches becoming popular in literature.\nHowever, a gap has been exposed in these techniques, as they fail to integrate\nnovel IPs into the model's knowledge base, subsequently resulting in poorly\ngenerated code. Additionally, as general-purpose LLMs continue to improve,\nfine-tuned methods on older models will not be able to compete to produce more\naccurate and efficient designs. Although some retrieval augmented generation\n(RAG) techniques exist to mitigate challenges presented in fine-tuning\napproaches, works tend to leverage low-quality codebases, incorporate\ncomputationally expensive fine-tuning in the frameworks, or do not use RAG\ndirectly in the RTL generation step. In this work, we introduce DeepV: a\nmodel-agnostic RAG framework to generate RTL designs by enhancing context\nthrough a large, high-quality dataset without any RTL-specific training.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on\nsingle-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications\npredominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,\nexecution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn\nbenchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or\nlimiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect\nproduction-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a\nbenchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction\nenvironment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata\nfiles, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit\nclarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human\nsupervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined\nconversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting\n(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator\nor explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD\nspectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by\nexecutable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks\nrequiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600\ntasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and\nBIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed\nbehavioral analysis and rapid method development.

Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:\nautomated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue\nmorphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,\nand existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack\ngeneralization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We\nintroduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel\nauto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features\nthrough a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed\nnetwork automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using\nthe extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for\noptimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into\nefficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based\nmethods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\\mu}m on the same-lab samples,\nmatching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\\mu}m) with half the\ninput requirements.

Traditional\nmotion planning finds collision-free paths, but this is overly restrictive in\nclutter, where it may not be possible for a robot to accomplish a task without\ncontact. In addition, contacts range from relatively benign (e.g. brushing a\nsoft pillow) to more dangerous (e.g. toppling a glass vase), making it\ndifficult to characterize which may be acceptable. In this paper, we propose\nIMPACT, a novel motion planning framework that uses Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) to infer environment semantics, identifying which parts of the\nenvironment can best tolerate contact based on object properties and locations.\nOur approach generates an anisotropic cost map that encodes directional push\nsafety.

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose AUREXA-SE (Audio-Visual Unified Representation\nExchange Architecture with Cross-Attention and Squeezeformer for Speech\nEnhancement), a progressive bimodal framework tailored for audio-visual speech\nenhancement (AVSE). AUREXA-SE jointly leverages raw audio waveforms and visual\ncues by employing a U-Net-based 1D convolutional encoder for audio and a Swin\nTransformer V2 for efficient and expressive visual feature extraction. Central\nto the architecture is a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism, which\nfacilitates deep contextual fusion between modalities, enabling rich and\ncomplementary representation learning. To capture temporal dependencies within\nthe fused embeddings, a stack of lightweight Squeezeformer blocks combining\nconvolutional and attention modules is introduced. The enhanced embeddings are\nthen decoded via a U-Net-style decoder for direct waveform reconstruction,\nensuring perceptually consistent and intelligible speech output. Experimental\nevaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AUREXA-SE, achieving significant\nperformance improvements over noisy baselines, with STOI of 0.516, PESQ of\n1.323, and SI-SDR of -4.322 dB. The source code of AUREXA-SE is available at\nhttps://github.com/mtanveer1/AVSEC-4-Challenge-2025.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and\nubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire\nspecialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great\nutility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two\nsecurity-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make\nthem infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network\nconnection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the\nsystem vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a\nsensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms\nproduce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work\naddresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private\noptimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language\nmodels. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering\nenhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our\noptimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language\nmodel (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B).

Unlike\nclassical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as\nobjective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,\nhowever, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation\nof action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with\npredictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address\nthese challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when\ncombined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action\nGradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to\nfulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient\nintegration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the\nQ-value with respect to the action to optimize the action.

    "summary": "This paper presents a state representation framework for Markov decision\nprocesses (MDPs) that can be learned solely from state trajectories, requiring\nneither reward signals nor the actions executed by the agent. We propose\nlearning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of\nactions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that\ncaptures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables\ncritical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and\nreward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of\nprogress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space\nwhere the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD,\naccommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the\nframework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values,\nencompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete\nand continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently\nlearns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also\nsignificantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of\nrepresentation quality.",

    "summary": "Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences\noften relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic\nrewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to\ncapture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data\nannotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward\nmodeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)\nmodel-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector\nscores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where\ndomain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with\nconfidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to\nenforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward\nto stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides\na flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement\nlearning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements\nacross different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect\nreward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall\naverage improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing\nspecifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant\naverage improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical\nreasoning and problem solving.",

    "summary": "Many safety post-training methods for large language models (LLMs) are\ndesigned to modify the model's behaviour from producing unsafe answers to\nissuing refusals. However, such distribution shifts are often brittle and\ndegrade performance on desirable tasks. To address these pitfalls, we propose\naugmenting the model's vocabulary with a special red flag token, and training\nthe model to insert this token whenever harmful content is generated or\nimminent. This approach enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of\nharmfulness in its representations, with minimal impact on utility due to the\nmarginal change in the generated distribution of natural language. Moreover,\nbecause the token is embedded in the model's vocabulary, we can naturally\nleverage the LLMs' generalization capabilities, such as in-context learning\n(ICL) and out-of-distribution generalization to languages that are not formally\nsupported (e.g., Japanese for Llama3). In particular, we demonstrate that\nthrough ICL alone, the model can learn to initiate reflective reasoning upon\ngenerating the red flag token at inference, which steers the response away from\nharmful continuations or enables self-correction when the flag is raised\nfalsely. This approach is orthogonal and complementary to existing safety\ntechnique (such as safety classifiers or standard safety training) and easier\nto evaluate in comparison to natural language refusals, as it does not require\na human or automated judge to assess the harmlessness of the answers.",

To address this, we propose Sensitivity Dropout\n(SenD), a novel training protocol designed to reduce hallucination variance\nduring training by deterministically dropping embedding indices with\nsignificant variability. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination\ndetection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the\ntraditional EigenScore in 2x speed. This metric is integrated into our training\nprotocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at\nreducing hallucination variance.

We show that this\nimprovement is primarily driven by the fact frequency in the pretraining\ncorpus: more frequent facts are more likely to be recalled correctly,\nregardless of language. Yet, some low-frequency facts in non-English languages\ncan still be correctly recalled. Our analysis reveals that these instances\nlargely benefit from crosslingual transfer of their English counterparts -- an\neffect that emerges predominantly in the early stages of pretraining. We\npinpoint two distinct pathways through which multilingual factual knowledge\nacquisition occurs: (1) frequency-driven learning, which is dominant and\nlanguage-agnostic, and (2) crosslingual transfer, which is limited in scale and\ntypically constrained to relation types involving named entities.

    "summary": "This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances\nboth accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a\nreasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of\ntext-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization\nprocess driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function\ndesigned to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our\napproach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for\nlanguage-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include\nimportant relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality\ndictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our\napproach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our\nexperiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two\ncommon failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited\none-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning\nwith Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing\nprior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our\nreward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human\nevaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely\naligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%\n(relative).",

    "title": "Mixing Mechanisms: How Language Models Retrieve Bound Entities\n  In-Context",
    "summary": "A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models\n(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent\n\"Ann loves pie\" by binding \"Ann\" to \"pie\", allowing it to later retrieve \"Ann\"\nwhen asked \"Who loves pie?\" Prior research on short lists of bound entities\nfound strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional\nmechanism, where \"Ann\" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this\nwork, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;\nas the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism\nbecomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we\nfind that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism\n(retrieving \"Ann\" using its bound counterpart \"pie\") and a reflexive mechanism\n(retrieving \"Ann\" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on\nnine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs\nmix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to\ndevelop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token\ndistributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes\nto substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity\ngroups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural\nsettings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs\nbind and retrieve entities in-context.",

    "summary": "The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large\nlanguage model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ)\nmethods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity\nacross bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low\nbit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook\nutilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method\nfor aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By\napplying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in\nthe key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data\ndistribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate\nefficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation\nwith dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization\nbaselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning\ntasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable\nto full precision, while delivering up to $\\mathbf{2.7\\times}$ speedup in\nlarge-batch self-attention computation and $\\mathbf{8.3\\times}$ reduction in\nsingle-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.",

This is especially valuable for low-resource\nlanguages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce\nhigh-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for\ntraining. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because\nextrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often\nunavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate\npoorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data\nEvaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without\nhuman test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate\ngenerator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all\nother candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this\nsmall model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment,\ntopic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other\nintrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within\n0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is\nmeasured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model\non the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and\nevaluating it on human-labelled test data.

We introduce parallel tokenizers.

This alignment enforces a\nshared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility\nbalance.

    "title": "On Relation-Specific Neurons in Large Language Models",
    "summary": "In large language models (LLMs), certain \\emph{neurons} can store distinct\npieces of knowledge learned during pretraining. While factual knowledge\ntypically appears as a combination of \\emph{relations} and \\emph{entities}, it\nremains unclear whether some neurons focus on a relation itself -- independent\nof any entity. We hypothesize such neurons \\emph{detect} a relation in the\ninput text and \\emph{guide} generation involving such a relation. To\ninvestigate this, we study the LLama-2 family on a chosen set of relations,\nwith a \\textit{statistics}-based method. Our experiments demonstrate the\nexistence of relation-specific neurons. We measure the effect of selectively\ndeactivating candidate neurons specific to relation $r$ on the LLM's ability to\nhandle (1) facts involving relation $r$ and (2) facts involving a different\nrelation $r' \\neq r$. With respect to their capacity for encoding relation\ninformation, we give evidence for the following three properties of\nrelation-specific neurons. \\textbf{(i) Neuron cumulativity.} Multiple neurons\njointly contribute to processing facts involving relation $r$, with no single\nneuron fully encoding a fact in $r$ on its own. \\textbf{(ii) Neuron\nversatility.} Neurons can be shared across multiple closely related as well as\nless related relations. In addition, some relation neurons transfer across\nlanguages. \\textbf{(iii) Neuron interference.} Deactivating neurons specific to\none relation can improve LLMs' factual recall performance for facts of other\nrelations. We make our code and data publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/cisnlp/relation-specific-neurons.",

    "summary": "Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging\ndomains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated\nby aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are\nimproving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the\nsubskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of\ntextbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into\nthree components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,\nReasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting\nrelevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each\ntest, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate\nreasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and\nprobes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic\nspecifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our\nanalysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,\nreinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when\nsupported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves\nperception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in\ntandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with\nresidual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,\nrobustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas\nmultimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and\nexperimental logs.",

    "summary": "When thinking with images, humans rarely rely on a single glance: they\nrevisit visual information repeatedly during reasoning. However, existing\nmodels typically process images only once and thereafter generate reasoning\nentirely in text, lacking mechanisms to re-access or ground inference in visual\nrepresentations. We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen,\nmodels progressively lose focus on relevant regions. In response, we introduce\nv1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a\nsimple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant\nimage patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream,\nensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence.\nCrucially, our pointing strategy lets the MLLM directly select image patches\nusing their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence\nembedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability,\nwe construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with\ninterleaved visual grounding annotations. Across various multimodal\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable\nbaselines, establishing point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded\nreasoning.

However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix\n($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor\nis inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by\ncomplex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the\nfeature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We\npropose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a\nmulti-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is\nasymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA,\nthese specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated\nby a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of\nour method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning\nmulti-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task\nreasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average\naccuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative\nimprovement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.",

However, divergent conclusions raise\nquestions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.\n(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the \"wh-effect\") to demonstrate\nthat models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan\net al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that\nmodels largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct\nminimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate\nthis by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and\nevaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic\nWilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across\nall four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing\nprinciples even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with\nthe more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of\nevaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that\nrequire extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse\nchains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two\ncompeting objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple\nreasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.\nExisting works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly\nuncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while\nothers improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence\npost-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer\nquality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different\nsources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should\nbe calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from\ntokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected\ncorrectness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:\nGreedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.\nCalibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on\nestimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing\nheuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and\ngeneral reasoning benchmarks.",

In this work, we propose the SAE-FiRE\n(Sparse Autoencoder for Financial Representation Enhancement) framework to\naddress these limitations by extracting key information while eliminating\nredundancy. SAE-FiRE employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose dense\nneural representations from large language models into interpretable sparse\ncomponents, then applies statistical feature selection methods, including ANOVA\nF-tests and tree-based importance scoring, to identify the top-k most\ndiscriminative dimensions for classification.

To address this, we study LLMs'\nreasoning in a well-defined fragment of logic: syllogistic reasoning. We cast\nthe problem as premise selection and construct controlled datasets to isolate\nlogical competence. Beyond evaluation, an open challenge is enabling LLMs to\nacquire abstract inference patterns that generalize to novel structures. We\npropose to apply few-shot meta-learning to this domain, thereby encouraging\nmodels to extract rules across tasks rather than memorize patterns within\ntasks. Although meta-learning has been little explored in the context of logic\nlearnability, our experiments show that it is effective: small models (1.5B-7B)\nfine-tuned with meta-learning demonstrate strong gains in generalization, with\nespecially pronounced benefits in low-data regimes. These meta-learned models\noutperform GPT-4o and o3-mini on our syllogistic reasoning task.",

    "summary": "In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large\nlanguage models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display\nculturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and\nERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in\nChinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ\nattribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models,\nclaiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts.\nWhile we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their\nexperiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we\ncritically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of\nLSZ. We argue that the reported \"cultural tendencies\" are not stable traits but\nfragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we\nconducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number\nof test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on\noutputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural\nbeliefs.",

Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to\nentropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited\nperformance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can\npromote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes.\nThis creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant\nmodes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy\nOptimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage\nrollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half\nof the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to\ntemporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to\nexplore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget\nmechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration\nduring rollouts.

We perform a sparsification study on\nseveral representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the\nmagnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune\nthe activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes\nonly negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only\nafter more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into\nneuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most\nneuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only\nhigh-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we\npropose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert\nselection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs\nnegligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or\ninter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches\ntraditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer\nparameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at\nequal numbers of activated parameters.

    "summary": "Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful\nparadigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It\nleverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,\nenabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate\nreasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG\nfrequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a\ncritical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do\ngraph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,\nwe propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate\nGraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual\nreasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of\nincreasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual\nsummarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the\nentire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final\ngeneration. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the\nconditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons\nfor its success, offering guidelines for its practical application.

    "summary": "Text clustering serves as a fundamental technique for organizing and\ninterpreting unstructured textual data, particularly in contexts where manual\nannotation is prohibitively costly. With the rapid advancement of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and their demonstrated effectiveness across a broad\nspectrum of NLP tasks, an emerging body of research has begun to explore their\npotential in the domain of text clustering. However, existing LLM-based\napproaches still rely on fine-tuned embedding models and sophisticated\nsimilarity metrics, rendering them computationally intensive and necessitating\ndomain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nframework that reframes text clustering as a classification task by harnessing\nthe in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. Our framework eliminates the need\nfor fine-tuning embedding models or intricate clustering algorithms. It\ncomprises two key steps: first, the LLM is prompted to generate a set of\ncandidate labels based on the dataset and then merges semantically similar\nlabels; second, it assigns the most appropriate label to each text sample. By\nleveraging the advanced natural language understanding and generalization\ncapabilities of LLMs, the proposed approach enables effective clustering with\nminimal human intervention. Experimental results on diverse datasets\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves comparable or superior performance to\nstate-of-the-art embedding-based clustering techniques, while significantly\nreducing computational complexity and resource requirements. These findings\nunderscore the transformative potential of LLMs in simplifying and enhancing\ntext clustering tasks.

Existing multilingual benchmarks are\npredominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric\nentities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based\nlocalization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,\ntruly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a\nframework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that\nautomatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and\ncurrencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can\nobscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural\ncontexts.

We propose\nVisualize-then-Retrieve (VisRet), a new paradigm for T2I retrieval that\nmitigates this limitation of cross-modal similarity alignment. VisRet first\nprojects textual queries into the image modality via T2I generation. Then, it\nperforms retrieval within the image modality to bypass the weaknesses of\ncross-modal retrievers in recognizing subtle visual-spatial features. Across\nfour benchmarks (Visual-RAG, INQUIRE-Rerank, Microsoft COCO, and our new\nVisual-RAG-ME featuring multi-entity comparisons), VisRet substantially\noutperforms cross-modal similarity matching and baselines that recast T2I\nretrieval as text-to-text similarity matching, improving nDCG@30 by 0.125 on\naverage with CLIP as the retriever and by 0.121 with E5-V.

To close this gap, we extend an existing dataset BBQ (Parrish et\nal., 2022) to Open-BBQ, a comprehensive framework to evaluate the social bias\nof LLMs in open-ended settings by incorporating two additional question\ncategories: fill-in-the-blank and short-answer. Since our new Open-BBQ dataset\ncontains a lot of open-ended responses like sentences and paragraphs, we\ndeveloped an evaluation process to detect biases from open-ended content by\nlabeling sentences and paragraphs. In addition to this, we also found that\nexisting debiasing methods, such as self-debiasing (Gallegos et al., 2024),\nhave over-correction issues, which make the original correct answers incorrect.\nIn order to solve this issue, we propose Composite Prompting, an In-context\nLearning (ICL) method combining structured examples with explicit\nchain-of-thought reasoning to form a unified instruction template for LLMs to\nexplicitly identify content that needs debiasing. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed method significantly reduces the bias for both GPT-3.5 and\nGPT-4o while maintaining high accuracy.",

    "summary": "Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements\nin multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with\nhandling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due\nto their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose\nFeedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework\ntailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive\nstrategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning\ntasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,\nwhich serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial\nnodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined\nthrough a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,\nwhich allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning\nstrategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node\ngeneration technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and\nconcurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic\nstrategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning\nprocess systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental\nresults show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset\nand 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and\n7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance\nlanguage agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.",

    "summary": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely utilized to incorporate\nexternal knowledge into large language models, thereby enhancing factuality and\nreducing hallucinations in question-answering (QA) tasks. A standard RAG\npipeline consists of several components, such as query rewriting, document\nretrieval, document filtering, and answer generation. However, these components\nare typically optimized separately through supervised fine-tuning, which can\nlead to misalignments between the objectives of individual components and the\noverarching aim of generating accurate answers. Although recent efforts have\nexplored using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize specific RAG components,\nthese approaches often focus on simple pipelines with only two components or do\nnot adequately address the complex interdependencies and collaborative\ninteractions among the modules. To overcome these limitations, we propose\ntreating the complex RAG pipeline with multiple components as a multi-agent\ncooperative task, in which each component can be regarded as an RL agent.\nSpecifically, we present MMOA-RAG, Multi-Module joint Optimization Algorithm\nfor RAG, which employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to harmonize all\nagents' goals toward a unified reward, such as the F1 score of the final\nanswer. Experiments conducted on various QA benchmarks demonstrate that\nMMOA-RAG effectively boost the overall performance of the pipeline and\noutperforms existing baselines.

Models trained using deep neural networks\n(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large\nlanguage models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical\ninterview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz\n(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to\nDNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot\ncounts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based\nmodels in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups\nsuch as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared\nto DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among\nfairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the\nworst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing\ndemographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.\nIn contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but\nperforms less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps\nmitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of\nshots does not lead to further reductions in disparities.

    "summary": "Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for\naligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model\nto generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide\nthe selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained\nwith direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains\nunderexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work,\nwe investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference\noptimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt\nas a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit\nsubstantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy\nprompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into\ntraining fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight\ndegradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that\nthe performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model\ncapacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model\ncapacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the\nnegative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that\nselectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances\noverall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons\nlearned.",

While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,\nevicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these\napproaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like\nvalues) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper\nintroduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression\nscheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV\nrepresents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling\nhardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using\n4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter\nLLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x\nreduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches\nfull-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on\ncomplex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task\nunderstanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval).

We present Prototype-Based\nDynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model\n(LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce\n\"reasoning prototypes\" by clustering activation differences between\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden\nstate is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering\nvector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently\nimproves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains\npersist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency,\nindicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather\nthan inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic,\nprototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time\napproaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.",

    "summary": "The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and\ncomputational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon\noptimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter\nupdates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite\nMuon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly\nleveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,\nwe bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an\noptimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level\nadaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively\nreduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform\nneuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.\nNorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum\nstatistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after\northogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving\nMuon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we\ndevelop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that\nstrategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.\nExperiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently\noutperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency\nthan Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while\nmaintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that\northogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than\ncompeting approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale\ndeep learning.",

    "summary": "Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,\nyet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,\nlimiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training\nevaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement\nLearning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on\nthe GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the\nBLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our\napproach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation\nwithin PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By\ncreating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using\n\\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of\ntraditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for\nlarge-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard\nlibrary for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that\nTensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and\nexceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance\ntransforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training\nloop. By clearly defining its role as a \"Token-ID BLEU\" for development\npurposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for\naccelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.",

Yet, with the proliferation of models\nand agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting\nthe best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different\nagents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models\nare not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms.\nExisting approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency\nwhile overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent\nin QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that\nformulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem\nsupervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA\ninstance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual\nentities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)\nto propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing\ndistributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted\naggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration\nschemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents.

Directly using such\nrationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training\nstability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,\na framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats\nLLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.\nThe framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust\nmetrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated\nrationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which\nassesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM\nAgreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics\nare integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training\nsamples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling\nreasoning-aware supervision.

Prior work evaluates novelty as originality with respect to model\ntraining data, but original outputs may be of low quality. In contrast,\nnon-expert judges more reliably score quality but may favor memorized outputs,\nlimiting the reliability of human preference as a metric. We introduce a new\nnovelty metric for LLM generations that balances originality and quality -- the\nharmonic mean of the fraction of \\ngrams unseen during training and a\ntask-specific quality score. Using this framework, we identify trends that\naffect the novelty of generations from three families of open-data models\n(OLMo, OLMo-2, and Pythia) on three creative tasks: story completion, poetry\nwriting, and creative tool use. We find that model-generated text from some\nbase LLMs is less novel than human-written text from the internet. However,\nincreasing model scale and post-training reliably improves novelty due to\nimprovements in output quality. We also find that improving the base model at\nthe same scale (\\eg OLMo 7B to OLMo-2 7B) leads to higher novelty due to higher\noriginality. Finally, we observe that inference-time methods, such as prompting\nand providing novel in-context examples, have a much smaller effect on novelty,\noften increasing originality at the expense of quality. This highlights the\nneed for further research into more effective elicitation strategies as we use\nmodels for creative applications.",

Then, a Load\nAgent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model.

The idea of the\nframework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating\nself-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer\nscoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 academic conferences, while\niteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where existing\nhypotheses cannot explain.

Human reviewers tend to explicitly\nreward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors (correlation =\n0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling posteriors in\ntheir review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving implicit reward to\nthem with positive scores.

This new music formalism is\nbased on Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM), and more specifically, its\ndiagrammatic incarnation Quantum Picturalism (QPict), which is heavily based on\nZX-calculus. In fact, it is naturally inherited from CQM/QPict. At its heart is\nthe explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and\nbetween the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation. QCM\nalso enables one to directly translate quantum phenomena into music\ncompositions in a both intuitively obvious, rigorous and mechanical manner.\n  Following this pattern, we propose a score for musicians interacting like a\nBell-pair under measurement, and outline examples of how it could be live\nperformed. While most of the Western classical music notation has heavily\nrelied on linear representation of music - which does not always adequately\ncapture the nature of music - our approach is distinct by highlighting the\nfundamental relational dimension of music. In addition, this quantum-based\ntechnique not only influences the music at the profound level of composition,\nbut also has a direct impact on a live performance, and also provides a new\ntemplate for automating music, e.g.~in the context of AI-generation.\n  All together, we initiate the creation of new music formalism that is\npowerful and efficient in capturing the interactive nature of music, both in\nterms of internal and external interactions, and goes beyond the boundaries of\nWestern classical music notation, which allows to use it in many different\ngenres and directions.",

More importantly, for systems\nto be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's\nprediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to\nthe original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their\nrepresentations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions\ncannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a\nprediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's\nprediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel\nmethod that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural\nnetwork to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.\nAuthorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is\nto measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural\nnetwork to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity\npredicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets\nshows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship\nverification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final\nprediction is faithful and interpretable.",

Even though\ndecoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at\ngenerating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal\nadaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model\narchitecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a\nseries of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing\nencoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for\ntime-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).\nWe find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when\nexisting approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other\ndomains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the\npotential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel\napproaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic\nbidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall\nperformance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model\nadaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance.

An ideal exploration strategy must\nnavigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also\nensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is\nsimple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures\ndegrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we\npropose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding\n(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early\ntokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an\nintuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by\nannealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This\ndynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then\ngradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the\nsampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable\ntraining. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that\nsignificantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming\nfixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes.

Our method builds upon the 4D online\nreconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,\nto strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct\nreadout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates\nheavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the\nrelatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it\nachieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs\nmultiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at\nreal-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive\nperformance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human\nmesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a\nsingle unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong\nbaseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in\nhttps://fanegg.github.io/Human3R",

    "summary": "We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves\nRGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces\nactive depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric\ndepth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation\nnetwork. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while\nstatic keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D\nto form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D\nSLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM\nattains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,\nmatching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS\non a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can\nreplace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,\nmarking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.",

However, the application of\nthese techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,\nwhile video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can\nthese videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic\nenough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is\ncrucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper\ninsights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to\nout-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the\ndriving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these\nquestions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to\nevaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of\nthe video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate\ndistribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that\nsynthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective\nalternative to real-world data collection.

    "summary": "The separation of overlapping objects presents a significant challenge in\nscientific imaging. While deep learning segmentation-regression algorithms can\npredict pixel-wise intensities, they typically treat all regions equally rather\nthan prioritizing overlap regions where attribution is most ambiguous. Recent\nadvances in instance segmentation show that weighting regions of pixel overlap\nin training can improve segmentation boundary predictions in regions of\noverlap, but this idea has not yet been extended to segmentation regression. We\naddress this with Overlap-Aware Segmentation of ImageS (OASIS): a new\nsegmentation-regression framework with a weighted loss function designed to\nprioritize regions of object-overlap during training, enabling extraction of\npixel intensities and topological features from heavily obscured objects. We\ndemonstrate OASIS in the context of the MIGDAL experiment, which aims to\ndirectly image the Migdal effect--a rare process where electron emission is\ninduced by nuclear scattering--in a low-pressure optical time projection\nchamber. This setting poses an extreme test case, as the target for\nreconstruction is a faint electron recoil track which is often heavily-buried\nwithin the orders-of-magnitude brighter nuclear recoil track. Compared to\nunweighted training, OASIS improves median intensity reconstruction errors from\n-32% to -14% for low-energy electron tracks (4-5 keV) and improves topological\nintersection-over-union scores from 0.828 to 0.855. These performance gains\ndemonstrate OASIS's ability to recover obscured signals in overlap-dominated\nregions.

This inverse\nprocess is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly\nchallenging, especially under sparse transmitter setups, e.g., with only one\ntransmitter. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows\npromising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it\nrequires time-consuming case-specific optimization and fails under sparse\ntransmitter setups. To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a\ndata-driven perspective. The scarcity of transmitters leads to an insufficient\namount of measured data, which fails to capture adequate physical information\nfor stable inversion. Built on this insight, we propose a fully end-to-end and\ndata-driven framework that predicts the relative permittivity of scatterers\nfrom measured fields, leveraging data distribution priors to compensate for the\nlack of physical information. This design enables data-driven training and\nfeed-forward prediction of relative permittivity while maintaining strong\nrobustness to transmitter sparsity.

    "summary": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer\nfrom significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By\ncomputing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs\nand offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that\nexisting methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same\ncomputation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token\nidentification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than\nsemantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive\ncomputation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones,\nleading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing\ncontiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework\nthat maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste,\nachieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and\nefficiency.

    "summary": "Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific\nobjects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge\nof RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels\nand continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced\nwith this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic\n`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an\ninformation bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts\n(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting\nprocess is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome\nthese fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that\nreconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us\nto harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel\ncontrol, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of\nconventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we\nreformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a\nvideo's holistic representation to its target mask.

    "summary": "Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,\nthe models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces\ntheir usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential\nsolution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static\nmatching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic\nalignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an\ninnovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing\ncancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current\nprototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a\nunified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features\nof whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates\ntraceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes\nthree main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges\ncritical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize\nlocal bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that\nsustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to\nadapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype\nmatching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and\ncohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive\nevaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method\nsurpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction\ntechniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective\non prototype learning for critical medical applications.

    "summary": "Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the\nsame scene, \\textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a\npopular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution\nimage. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the\ntensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional\nlow-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive\nthe fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively\nleverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously\nincorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This\nintroduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and\noptimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel\nhyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level\npriors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the\nproposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by\ncasting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral\nsubspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial\nmaps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial\nlow-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed\nnon-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw\ninspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to\ndesign an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically\nproving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments\non multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\nThe code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.",

While 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) delivers real-time, high-fidelity rendering, its performance\ndrastically deteriorates under sparse inputs, plagued by floating artifacts and\nstructural failures. To address these challenges, we introduce HBSplat, a\nunified framework that elevates 3DGS by seamlessly integrating robust\nstructural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region completion. Our\ncore contributions are threefold: a Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that\nensures multi-view consistency by leveraging dense matching priors and\nintegrating reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints; a\nBidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method that enforces substantially\nstronger constraints by creating high-fidelity virtual views through\nbidirectional depth-image warping and multi-view fusion; and an Occlusion-Aware\nReconstruction component that recovers occluded areas using a depth-difference\nmask and a learning-based inpainting model.

The novel unification\nintroduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that\nhelp understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also\nleads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the\nCIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet\nInception Distance (FID) values of \\textbf{\\emph{1.46}} for unconditional\ngeneration and \\textbf{\\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation.

    "summary": "Existing video generation models predominantly emphasize appearance fidelity\nwhile exhibiting limited ability to synthesize complex human motions, such as\nwhole-body movements, long-range dynamics, and fine-grained human-environment\ninteractions. This often leads to unrealistic or physically implausible\nmovements with inadequate structural coherence. To conquer these challenges, we\npropose MoSA, which decouples the process of human video generation into two\ncomponents, i.e., structure generation and appearance generation. MoSA first\nemploys a 3D structure transformer to generate a human motion sequence from the\ntext prompt. The remaining video appearance is then synthesized under the\nguidance of this structural sequence. We achieve fine-grained control over the\nsparse human structures by introducing Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules with\na dense tracking constraint during training. The modeling of human-environment\ninteractions is improved through the proposed contact constraint. Those two\ncomponents work comprehensively to ensure the structural and appearance\nfidelity across the generated videos. This paper also contributes a large-scale\nhuman video dataset, which features more complex and diverse motions than\nexisting human video datasets.

Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention,\nwhere we steer the output of diffusion models based on some measure of the\ncontent's goodness. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual\nquality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should\noptimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper,\nwe propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can\nselect a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward at\ninference time. We then point out that improving perceptual video quality with\nrespect to alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting\nexisting metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models\nevaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do\nnot always correlate with the evaluation. We demonstrate that our method\nimproves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and\nhuman assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best\ngeneration compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more\nefficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is\nbeneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical\nguideline: we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into\nenabling the lookahead estimator and increasing the search budget, rather than\nexpanding the denoising steps.",

In particular,\nwe demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can\nbe leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating\nstructurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological\ncomponent analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent\ndictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by\nintroducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA\ndictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).\nAfter deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA\napplied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising\napplications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an\nexample of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed\nwith a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle\nfrom wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.",

    "summary": "Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,\nsuch as images and videos, which typically characterize low-rank structures.\nLow-rank tensor decomposition has become essential in machine learning and\ncomputer vision, but existing methods like Tucker decomposition offer\nflexibility at the expense of interpretability. The CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)\ndecomposition provides a natural and interpretable structure, while obtaining a\nsparse solutions remains challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP\ndecomposition, we propose a CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by\nneural networks (NN) for implicit neural representation. This approach can\nmodel the tensor both on-grid and beyond grid, fully utilizing the\nnon-linearity of NN with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To\nachieve sparser CP decomposition, we introduce a variational Schatten-p\nquasi-norm to prune redundant rank-1 components and prove that it serves as a\ncommon upper bound for the Schatten-p quasi-norms of arbitrary unfolding\nmatrices. For smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the\nspectral norm of the Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. The proposed\nsmoothness regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule\nderivations. It can serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV)\nregularization in image denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to implicit\nneural representation. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery\ntasks, including image inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling,\ndemonstrate the superiority and versatility of our method compared to\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

    "summary": "The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has\nreshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing\nself-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines\nfor vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,\nits use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare\ndifferent token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.\nIn this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for\nmedical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and\nattention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image\nclassification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense\nprediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse\nmodalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of\npretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also\nexamine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show\nthat, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution\nor pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.\nPretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new\ntoken mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of\nconvolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the\npreferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to\nstandard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the\nnecessary cross-channel interactions.

As a\nfirst step, we propose an algorithm to generate fast and reproducible\nprobability maps of the skeleton, adjacent internal organs (liver, spleen,\nurinary bladder, and kidneys), and spinal canal. Methods: We developed an\nautomated deep-learning pipeline based on a 3D patch-based Residual U-Net\narchitecture that localises and delineates these anatomical structures on\nWB-DWI. The algorithm was trained using \"soft labels\" (non-binary\nsegmentations) derived from a computationally intensive atlas-based approach.\nFor training and validation, we employed a multi-centre WB-DWI dataset\ncomprising 532 scans from patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) or\nMultiple Myeloma (MM), with testing on 45 patients.

Two experienced radiologists rated\nthe model's outputs as either \"good\" or \"excellent\" on test scans, with\ninter-reader agreement from fair to substantial (Gwet's AC1 = 0.27-0.72).\nConclusion: The model offers fast, reproducible probability maps for localising\nand delineating body regions on WB-DWI, potentially enabling non-invasive\nimaging biomarker quantification to support disease staging and treatment\nresponse assessment.",

However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or\nnon-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand\nthe content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually\nincorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,\nwe investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a\nkey finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene\ntext regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we\npropose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising\ntwo key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies\npotential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer\nCorrection, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers\nless prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs\nfor non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To\nenable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of 1,740\nsamples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually curated\nquestion answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic\nhallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for\nscene text spotting and understanding.",

Current\napproaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only\nstruggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target\nfeatures, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex\nomni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance\nvariations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing\nparadigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing\nimaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor\nplatforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this\nlimitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target\nDetector (AuxDet), a novel multimodal framework that is the first to\nincorporate metadata into the IRSTD paradigm for scene-aware optimization.\nThrough a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer perceptrons\n(MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with visual features,\nguiding adaptive representation learning for each individual sample.\nAdditionally, we design a lightweight prior-initialized enhancement module\nusing 1D convolutional blocks to further refine fused features and recover\nfine-grained target cues.

    "summary": "Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks\nbut remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work\nrevisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We\nempirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse\nvariant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and\nwe complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory\nside, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA\nfeatures: for both $\\ell_\\infty$ and $\\ell_2$ threat models (binary and\nmulticlass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\\top u$ shrink,\nwhere $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for\ngeneral (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a\nLipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.\nEmpirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA\nconsistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and\nblack-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Previous\nstudies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn\ndiscriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world\napplications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during\ndissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to\nthe generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a\nnovel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert\nModality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective.\nIt consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to\ncompensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary\ninformation through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters\ncompensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature\ndistribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive\nweighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning.\nWe evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages,\ndemonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while\nmaintaining relative simplicity.

In this paper,\nwe propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion\npriors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.\nFlow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial\nlevels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)\nadaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow\npriors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to\nfilter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)\nfurther refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy\nvideo tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide\nrange of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding\ntasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.",

For instance, ECG data can reveal changes in heart rate variability\nlinked to emotional arousal, stress levels, and autonomic nervous system\nactivity. This data offers a window into the physiological basis of our\nemotional states. Recent advancements in the field diverge from conventional\napproaches by leveraging the power of advanced transformer architectures, which\nsurpass traditional machine learning and deep learning methods.

In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform\nto human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually\ndestroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving\nsemantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition inspired\nmultimodal boundary preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net\nutilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within\nimages and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack\nof semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the\nerroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of\nIML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM).

This\nmulti-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the\noptimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to\nachieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this\npaper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address\nthese problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization\nencoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object\nacross multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each\nproduct as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is\nadopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively\nincorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.\nIn offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while\nimproving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it\nachieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and\n+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,\ngenerative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while\nsimplifying the serving pathway.",

    "summary": "The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation\nis extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this\nburden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate\nthis dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR\ninstance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to\ngenerate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our\napproach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text\nand images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels\nthrough a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D\nsemantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature\nlearning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D\nprior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a\nnovel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature\nspace by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results\nin significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for\nunsupervised 3D instance segmentation.

    "summary": "Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly\ndesirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.\nHowever, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.\nIn this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and\ncontextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and\nsuch a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.\nSpecifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are\ninherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a\nrealistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which\ninevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to\ndirectly model \"object\" as the visual equivalence of \"word,\" pushing the model\nto learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate\nour hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach\ncan be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random\npatches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations\nreveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a\nreal-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned\nwithout it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual\nquestion answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning\nand contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our\nstudy highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a\nplausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.\nCode and model will be publicly released.

    "summary": "The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the\ngermination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,\nimage-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously\ncapture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.\nThe objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination\ndynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline\nwas developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features\nto identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions\nwhere traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in\nits temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current\nstatus but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach\nenables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when\noverlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method\ndemonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in\nchallenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results\nconfirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and\nearly seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining\nlow-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain\nphenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal\nintegration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise\ndetermination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly\neffective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation\ntechniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate\ncounting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root\nmean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.",

    "summary": "Despite the prevalence of transparent object interactions in human everyday\nlife, transparent robotic manipulation research remains limited to\nshort-horizon tasks and basic grasping capabilities.Although some methods have\npartially addressed these issues, most of them have limitations in\ngeneralizability to novel objects and are insufficient for precise long-horizon\nrobot manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose DeLTa (Demonstration\nand Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation), a novel framework\nthat integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language\nplanning for precise long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by\nnatural task instructions. A key advantage of our method is its\nsingle-demonstration approach, which generalizes 6D trajectories to novel\ntransparent objects without requiring category-level priors or additional\ntraining. Additionally, we present a task planner that refines the\nVLM-generated plan to account for the constraints of a single-arm, eye-in-hand\nrobot for long-horizon object manipulation tasks. Through comprehensive\nevaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing\ntransparent object manipulation approaches, particularly in long-horizon\nscenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities.

    "summary": "Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision\nand multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in\nvideo generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific\nchallenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by\ndecomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.\nBuilding on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for\nthe temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel\nspectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and\nscalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer\npipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the\nliterature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based\nencoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same\nconcert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in\nwhich raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.\nWe show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points\nand provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art\nin multimodal automated video editing.",

    "summary": "The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a\nbackground scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine\nthe correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality\npersonalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat\nthem as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically\nrely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a\nunified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image\ndiffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the\nknowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific\ntraining. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our\nmethod achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people\ninto scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism\nensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,\nclothing, and body features from just a single reference image.

    "summary": "Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous\nand prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge\nas the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater\ncomplexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common\ntumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)\nencompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological\nsubtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment\n(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not\nadequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a\nlimited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping\nperformance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance\nhistological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro\nhierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a\nmicro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a\ngeometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise\nperspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical\nField-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and\nmeso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented\nmicro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via\npresent Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype\ninteractions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate\nthat our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological\nsubtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for\nprimary liver malignancies in clinical practice.",

We validate EduVerse in\nmiddle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and\nmultiple sessions.

    "summary": "Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an\nembedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.\nHyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer\nstructures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on\npair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,\nsupervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet\ndue to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.\nHowever, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they\nhave less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the\nCombined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is\ncomposed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the\nregularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that\nthe combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and\nlearning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four\nbenchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.",

    "summary": "Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data\nexhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical\npredefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed).\nHowever, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may\nfollow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a\nControllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled\ndataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the\nunlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a\nknown distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution.\nSpecifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization\ncycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism\nselectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into\nthe labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known\ndistribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit\nadjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved\nclassifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next\ntraining step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can\nsignificantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.\nAdditionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further\nimprove the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to\nmaximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples.\nComprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that\nCPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up\nto $\\textbf{15.97\\%}$ in accuracy.

Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from\nthree published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of\n-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for\ndesert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than\nstandard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal\naccuracy loss.\n  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger\ncrop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp\nimprovement over prior baselines.

Moreover, we prove the separated Lipschitz continuity\nof the objective function and its associated functions, including the gradient,\nwhich supports the convergence of our proposed iterative scheme, despite the\nnon-convexity of the objective function with respect to the affine motion\nparameters.

    "summary": "Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye\nsyndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack\nof annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear\nFilm Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task\ntear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247\nframes) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',\n'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area\nsegmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and\nefficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini\nbackbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid\nnetwork to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational\nefficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark\nperformance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several\nstate-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design\nTF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages\nmodels trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially\norchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region\nlocalization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully\nautomates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research\nin ocular surface diagnostics.

    "summary": "Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their\npotential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex\nspatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the\npre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we\npropose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring\na lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed\narchitecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that\nrefine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared\ngated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its\nlimited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,\nrecognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic\nstructure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes\nlearning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by\nlowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary\ntemperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting\ninsufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on\nscale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and\ndiverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while\nsignificantly improving both training and inference efficiency.",

    "summary": "In this work, we introduce long-video masked-embedding autoencoders (LV-MAE),\na self-supervised learning framework for long video representation. Our\napproach treats short- and long-span dependencies as two separate tasks. Such\ndecoupling allows for a more intuitive video processing where short-span\nspatiotemporal primitives are first encoded and are then used to capture\nlong-range dependencies across consecutive video segments. To achieve this, we\nleverage advanced off-the-shelf multimodal encoders to extract representations\nfrom short segments within the long video, followed by pre-training a\nmasked-embedding autoencoder capturing high-level interactions across segments.\nLV-MAE is highly efficient to train and enables the processing of much longer\nvideos by alleviating the constraint on the number of input frames.\nFurthermore, unlike existing methods that typically pre-train on short-video\ndatasets, our approach offers self-supervised pre-training using long video\nsamples (e.g., 20+ minutes video clips) at scale. Using LV-MAE representations,\nwe achieve state-of-the-art results on three long-video benchmarks -- LVU,\nCOIN, and Breakfast -- employing only a simple classification head for either\nattentive or linear probing. Finally, to assess LV-MAE pre-training and\nvisualize its reconstruction quality, we leverage the video-language aligned\nspace of short video representations to monitor LV-MAE through video-text\nretrieval.

To prevent\nthe two models from collapsing into similar failure modes due to confirmation\nbias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that applies two complementary\nmasks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a self-supervised soft mask, which leads\nto an asymmetric training process of the two models, reducing shared error\nmodes. In addition, to improve the efficiency of model training, we introduce a\nlightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy, which replaces one of the two\nmodels with a dynamically updated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and\nemploys an alternating masking strategy to preserve divergence.

    "summary": "Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have\nenabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and\ntransmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.\nExisting compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow\nand scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which\ndegrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent\ndata-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this\ntrade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering\nquality. We introduce ExGS, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies\nUniversal Gaussian Compression (UGC) with GaussPainter for Extreme 3DGS\ncompression. UGC performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce\nGaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas\nGaussPainter leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to\nrestore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes. Unlike\nconventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing regions but\nalso enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in degraded\nrenderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a one-step\ndiffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can even\nachieve over 100X compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to about 3.31\nMB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under\nchallenging conditions.

    "summary": "Purpose: To improve the generalization ability of deep learning based\npredictions of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) from high-pass\nfiltered phase (HPFP) data. Methods: A network fine-tuning step called HP-FINE\nis proposed, which is based on the high-pass filtering forward model with\nlow-frequency preservation regularization. Several comparisons were conducted:\n1. HP-FINE with and without low-frequency regularization, 2. three 3D network\narchitectures (Unet, Progressive Unet, and Big Unet), 3. two types of network\noutput (recovered field and susceptibility), and 4. pre-training with and\nwithout the filtering augmentation. HPFP datasets with diverse high-pass\nfilters, another acquisition voxel size, and prospective acquisition were used\nto assess the accuracy of QSM predictions. In the retrospective datasets,\nquantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, RMSE and HFEN) were used for evaluation. In\nthe prospective dataset, statistics of ROI linear regression and Bland-Altman\nanalysis were used for evaluation. Results: In the retrospective datasets,\nadding low-frequency regularization in HP-FINE substantially improved\nprediction accuracy compared to the pre-trained results, especially when\ncombined with the filtering augmentation and recovered field output. In the\nprospective datasets, HP-FINE with low-frequency regularization and recovered\nfield output demonstrated the preservation of ROI values, a result that was not\nachieved when using susceptibility as the output. Furthermore, Progressive Unet\npre-trained with a combination of multiple losses outperformed both Unet and\nProgressive Unet pre-trained with a single loss in terms of preserving ROI\nvalues.",

    "summary": "Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the\ntarget object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections.\nHowever, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly\nmask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not\nexplicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack\ncontrollability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify\nthat these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an\nobject's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation,\nwe propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal\ninto (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we\nremove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly\nmask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong\ngeometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB\nimage conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are\nconsidered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide\nlearning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven\nobjective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to\nremove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new\nstructural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their\nassociated artifacts on two popular benchmarks.

    "summary": "Recently, self-supervised representation learning relying on vast amounts of\nunlabeled data has been explored as a pre-training method for autonomous\ndriving. However, directly applying popular contrastive or generative methods\nto this problem is insufficient and may even lead to negative transfer. In this\npaper, we present AD-L-JEPA, a novel self-supervised pre-training framework\nwith a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) for automotive LiDAR\nobject detection. Unlike existing methods, AD-L-JEPA is neither generative nor\ncontrastive. Instead of explicitly generating masked regions, our method\npredicts Bird's-Eye-View embeddings to capture the diverse nature of driving\nscenes. Furthermore, our approach eliminates the need to manually form\ncontrastive pairs by employing explicit variance regularization to avoid\nrepresentation collapse. Experimental results demonstrate consistent\nimprovements on the LiDAR 3D object detection downstream task across the\nKITTI3D, Waymo, and ONCE datasets, while reducing GPU hours by 1.9x-2.7x and\nGPU memory by 2.8x-4x compared with the state-of-the-art method Occupancy-MAE.\nNotably, on the largest ONCE dataset, pre-training on 100K frames yields a 1.61\nmAP gain, better than all other methods pre-trained on either 100K or 500K\nframes, and pre-training on 500K frames yields a 2.98 mAP gain, better than all\nother methods pre-trained on either 500K or 1M frames.

Because soil N has\nhigh spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate\nthe N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the\nindividual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used\nin-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of\nfour different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over\ntwo growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N\nconcentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two\nfeature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral\nbands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral\nbands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,\nGradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The\ncomparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets\nshowed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection\nmethods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level\ndatasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,\nand 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral\nregions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction\ndemonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level\ndata and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets\nof selected spectral bands for each analysis level.

Experiments incorporate auxiliary point\nfeatures including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part\nparsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D\n120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal\naction recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and\nestimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%\naccuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,\noutperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.",

Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on\ntens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of\nGaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require\nadjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual\nquality. In this work, we propose \"ArchitectHead\", the first framework for\ncreating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our\nkey idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose\na UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode\ntheir latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then\ntransforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.\nArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling\nfeature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method\nenables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.\nExperimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nquality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while\nmaintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs.

    "summary": "A unified representation space in multi-modal learning is essential for\neffectively integrating diverse data sources, such as text, images, and audio,\nto enhance efficiency and performance across various downstream tasks. Recent\nbinding methods, such as ImageBind, typically rely on a single, fixed anchor\nmodality for aligning multi-modal data. We mathematically analyze these fixed\nanchor binding methods and uncover significant limitations: (1) over-reliance\non the choice of the anchor modality, (2) inadequate capture of intra-modal\ninformation, and (3) failure to account for cross-modal correlation among\nnon-anchored modalities. To address these issues, we propose the need for\nadaptive anchor binding methods, exemplified by our framework CentroBind. The\nproposed method uses adaptively adjustable centroid-based anchors generated\nfrom all available modalities, leading to a balanced and rich representation\nspace. We theoretically demonstrate that our approach captures three critical\nproperties of multi-modal learning -- intra-modal learning, inter-modal\nlearning, and multi-modal alignment -- while constructing a unified\nrepresentation that spans all modalities. Experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets show that adaptive anchor methods such as CentroBind\nconsistently outperform fixed anchor binding methods, verifying our analysis.",

    "summary": "Contrastive learning methods in computer vision typically rely on augmented\nviews of the same image or multimodal pretraining strategies that align paired\nmodalities. However, these approaches often overlook semantic relationships\nbetween distinct instances, leading to false negatives when semantically\nsimilar samples are treated as negatives. This limitation is especially\ncritical in medical imaging domains such as cardiology, where demographic and\nclinical attributes play a critical role in assessing disease risk and patient\noutcomes. We introduce a tabular-guided contrastive learning framework that\nleverages clinically relevant tabular data to identify patient-level\nsimilarities and construct more meaningful pairs, enabling semantically aligned\nrepresentation learning without requiring joint embeddings across modalities.\nAdditionally, we adapt the k-NN algorithm for zero-shot prediction to overcome\nthe lack of zero-shot capability in unimodal representations. We demonstrate\nthe strength of our methods using a large cohort of short-axis cardiac MR\nimages and clinical attributes, where tabular data helps to more effectively\ndistinguish between patient subgroups. Evaluation on downstream tasks,\nincluding fine-tuning, linear probing, and zero-shot prediction of\ncardiovascular artery diseases and cardiac phenotypes, shows that incorporating\ntabular data guidance yields stronger visual representations than conventional\nmethods that rely solely on image augmentation or combined image-tabular\nembeddings. Further, we show that our method can generalize to natural images\nby evaluating it on a car advertisement dataset. The code will be available on\nGitHub upon acceptance.",

However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization\nbetween two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness\nin adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea\nof mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose\ntwo novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)\nweighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization\nregularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual\nKullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control\nover the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and\nauxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target\ndistribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization\nand enhancing model robustness.

    "summary": "Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how\nvarious input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output\nprediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act\nindependently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves\ninteractions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature\ncontributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order\nfeature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients\n(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable\nAI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural\nconnections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several\ntheoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a\nfew examples.",

Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but\nthousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional\nmachine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as\nfoundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle\nlarge feature counts (>500).

It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,\nwhile maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical\napplications.

    "summary": "We study hypothesis testing (aka state certification) in the non-identically\ndistributed setting. A recent work (Garg et al. 2023) considered the classical\ncase, in which one is given (independent) samples from $T$ unknown probability\ndistributions $p_1, \\dots, p_T$ on $[d] = \\{1, 2, \\dots, d\\}$, and one wishes\nto accept/reject the hypothesis that their average $p_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ equals a\nknown hypothesis distribution $q$. Garg et al. showed that if one has just $c =\n2$ samples from each $p_i$, and provided $T \\gg \\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\epsilon^2} +\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^4}$, one can (whp) distinguish $p_{\\mathrm{avg}} = q$ from\n$d_{\\mathrm{TV}}(p_{\\mathrm{avg}},q) > \\epsilon$. This nearly matches the\noptimal result for the classical iid setting (namely, $T \\gg\n\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\epsilon^2}$). Besides optimally improving this result (and\ngeneralizing to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures), we\nstudy the analogous problem of hypothesis testing for non-identical quantum\nstates. Here we uncover an unexpected phenomenon: for any $d$-dimensional\nhypothesis state $\\sigma$, and given just a single copy ($c = 1$) of each state\n$\\rho_1, \\dots, \\rho_T$, one can distinguish $\\rho_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\sigma$\nfrom $D_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{avg}},\\sigma) > \\epsilon$ provided $T \\gg\nd/\\epsilon^2$. (Again, we generalize to tolerant testing with more stringent\ndistance measures.) This matches the optimal result for the iid case, which is\nsurprising because doing this with $c = 1$ is provably impossible in the\nclassical case. We also show that the analogous phenomenon happens for the\nnon-iid extension of identity testing between unknown states. A technical tool\nwe introduce may be of independent interest: an Efron-Stein inequality, and\nmore generally an Efron-Stein decomposition, in the quantum setting.",

While HP\nguarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is\nunderstood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in\ndecentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded\ngradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap\nbetween assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the\nmean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic\nGradient Descent ($\\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized\nsettings, where it is known that $\\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same\nconditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.\nMotivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ in\nthe presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in\nHP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing\nuniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while\nsimultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly\nconvex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the\nnumber of users, demonstrating that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong\nperformance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved\nresults stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest\n(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap\nbetween users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on\nthe variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more\nfine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of\nindependent interest.",

While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost\nwithout sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused\non the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model\nfaithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like\nhealthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain\nfaithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a\nnovel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond\nstandard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics\nthat capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions\ninclude introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the\noriginal and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared\ntests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across\nboth the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts\nthat aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by\napplying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained\non three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high\naccuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect\nsubtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as\nAccuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more\ndirect method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not\ncompromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.",

MTL assumes tasks share\nsimilarities that can improve performance. In addition, boosting algorithms\nhave demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse learning problems,\nprimarily due to their ability to focus on hard-to-learn instances and\niteratively reduce residual errors.

Specifically, our analysis\nis based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify\nthe extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which\naggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this\nquantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two\ndifferent properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node\nembeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight\nmatrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show\nthat oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the\nnumber of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise\nbounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,\nadjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we\nintroduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification\naccuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that\nby reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in\nsome tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold\nstart\" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled\nnodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size\n(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.\nThis is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of\ntrainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of\nthe GNN.",

    "summary": "Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event\nsequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on\nautoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.\nRecent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by\njointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and\ndeletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this\nperspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise\nto data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the\ninstantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we\nattain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number\nof necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate\nthe generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range\nof unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.",

    "summary": "Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models\n(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.\nHowever, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained\nmodels, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from\nthose of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the\nlong-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,\nprimarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this\npaper, we introduce BLISS (\\textbf{B}ileve\\textbf{L} \\textbf{I}nfluence\n\\textbf{S}coring method for data \\textbf{S}election): a lightweight data\nselection method that operates entirely \\emph{from scratch}, without relying on\nany external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the\nlong-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a\nsurrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term\ninfluence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We\nformulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the\nupper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to\ntraining samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,\ntraining the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)\nleads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model\npredicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of\nhigh-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining\n410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4\ndataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\\times$\nspeedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,\ndemonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.",

We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body\nof scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of\ngoverning physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering\nRaman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)\nmeasurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating\nnon-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover\nRaman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is\na physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to\ndisentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the\nKramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss\non the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.\nTrained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot\ngeneralization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and\nsignificantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that\ntraining with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any\nground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results.

While traditional\nmesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive\nand require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties.

Angle encoding has emerged as\na popular choice as feature map (FM) for embedding classical data into quantum\nmodels due to its simplicity and natural generation of truncated Fourier\nseries, providing universal function approximation capabilities. Efficient FMs\nwithin quantum circuits can exploit exponential scaling of Fourier frequencies,\nwith multi-dimensional inputs introducing additional exponential growth through\nmixed-frequency terms. Despite this promising expressive capability, practical\nimplementation faces significant challenges.

We challenge the dominant autoregressive\nparadigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or\norder-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We\nanalyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify\ntemporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting\nobjective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines.

    "summary": "Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent\ntransportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous\ndata sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches\ntypically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting\nthe inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to\ninformation loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a\nnovel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates\nGPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE\naccuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction\nmodule to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,\nwhile a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information\ndensity for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining\nobjectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further\nstrengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong\ngeneralization abilities.

In this setting, recent foundation models initially failed\nto improve their performance over time.

To achieve\nthis and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity,\nefficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine\nShapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two\nnovel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to\ninterpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of\nhigher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of\nthe null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements\nand flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with\nvanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The\nlatter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of\nhierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply\na unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical\nproperties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the\nprojection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion\nalgebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain\npreviously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new\nperspective.

The topic is especially\nrelevant for instruments such as the rhythm guitar, which is typically played\nby strumming rhythmic patterns that repeat and vary over time. However, in many\ncases one cannot objectively define a single \"right\" rhythmic pattern for a\ngiven song section. To create a dataset with well-defined ground-truth labels,\nwe asked expert musicians to transcribe the rhythmic patterns in 410 popular\nsongs and record cover versions where the guitar tracks followed those\ntranscriptions. To transcribe the strums and their corresponding rhythmic\npatterns, we propose a three-step framework. Firstly, we perform approximate\nstem separation to extract the guitar part from the polyphonic mixture.\nSecondly, we detect individual strums within the separated guitar audio, using\na pre-trained foundation model (MERT) as a backbone. Finally, we carry out a\npattern-decoding process in which the transcribed sequence of guitar strums is\nrepresented by patterns drawn from an expert-curated vocabulary. We show that\nit is possible to transcribe the rhythmic patterns of the guitar track in\npolyphonic music with quite high accuracy, producing a representation that is\nhuman-readable and includes automatically detected bar lines and time signature\nmarkers.

Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer\nlearning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by\ncomparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help\npractitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.\nWe find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for\nscore-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy\nrisks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio\nAttack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental\nscenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against\nmodels fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.",

AuToMATo combines the existing\nToMATo clustering algorithm with a bootstrapping procedure in order to separate\nsignificant peaks of an estimated density function from non-significant ones.\nWe perform a thorough comparison of AuToMATo (with its parameters fixed to\ntheir defaults) against many other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

    "summary": "Backdoor attacks have become a significant threat to the pre-training and\ndeployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). Although numerous methods for\ndetecting and mitigating backdoor attacks have been proposed, most rely on\nidentifying and eliminating the ``shortcut\" created by the backdoor, which\nlinks a specific source class to a target class. However, these approaches can\nbe easily circumvented by designing multiple backdoor triggers that create\nshortcuts everywhere and therefore nowhere specific. In this study, we explore\nthe concept of Multi-Trigger Backdoor Attacks (MTBAs), where multiple\nadversaries leverage different types of triggers to poison the same dataset. By\nproposing and investigating three types of multi-trigger attacks including\n\\textit{parallel}, \\textit{sequential}, and \\textit{hybrid} attacks, we\ndemonstrate that 1) multiple triggers can coexist, overwrite, or cross-activate\none another, and 2) MTBAs easily break the prevalent shortcut assumption\nunderlying most existing backdoor detection/removal methods, rendering them\nineffective. Given the security risk posed by MTBAs, we have created a\nmulti-trigger backdoor poisoning dataset to facilitate future research on\ndetecting and mitigating these attacks, and we also discuss potential defense\nstrategies against MTBAs.

However, the problem is typically\nintractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,\nwe explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the\nbundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation\nof the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a\nspecific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal\nbundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to\nderive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further\nproposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN\ntrained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve\nnear-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational\ntime for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions\nfor larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as\nbundle size pricing (BSP).

    "summary": "Testing for individual discrimination involves deriving a profile, the\ncomparator, similar to the one making the discrimination claim, the\ncomplainant, based on a protected attribute, such as race or gender, and\ncomparing their decision outcomes. The complainant-comparator pair is central\nto discrimination testing. Most discrimination testing tools rely on this pair\nto establish evidence for discrimination. In this work we revisit the role of\nthe comparator in discrimination testing. We first argue for the inherent\ncausal modeling nature of deriving the comparator. We then introduce a\ntwo-kinds classification for the comparator: the ceteris paribus, or``with all\nelse equal,'' (CP) comparator and the mutatis mutandis, or ``with the\nappropriate adjustments being made,'' (MM) comparator. The CP comparator is the\nstandard comparator, representing an idealized comparison for establishing\ndiscrimination as it aims for a complainant-comparator pair that only differs\non membership to the protected attribute. As an alternative to it, we define\nthe MM comparator, which requires that the comparator represents the``what\nwould have been of'' the complainant without the effects of the protected\nattribute on the non-protected attributes. Under the MM comparator, the\ncomplainant-comparator pair can be dissimilar in terms of the non-protected\nattributes, departing from an idealized comparison.

To address these issues, we\npropose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a\nnovel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic\nperformance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the\nlearning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and\na downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer\nmodule is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract\ntemporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual\ninputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract\nvisual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is\ndiscarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged\naccess to global state information supervises the agent during early training\nto provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This\nguidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training\nprogresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments\ndemonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic\npolicy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and\nperceptually complex scenarios.",

    "summary": "Conformal prediction has emerged as a widely used framework for constructing\nvalid prediction sets in classification and regression tasks. In this work, we\nextend the split conformal prediction framework to hierarchical classification,\nwhere prediction sets are commonly restricted to internal nodes of a predefined\nhierarchy, and propose two computationally efficient inference algorithms. The\nfirst algorithm returns internal nodes as prediction sets, while the second one\nrelaxes this restriction. Using the notion of representation complexity, the\nlatter yields smaller set sizes at the cost of a more general and combinatorial\ninference problem. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in achieving nominal\ncoverage.",

When the hyperparameters are tuned on\nsensitive data, privacy becomes an important challenge and to this end,\ndifferential privacy has emerged as the de facto standard for provable privacy.\nA standard setting when performing distributed learning tasks is that clients\nagree on a shared setup, i.e., find a compromise from a set of hyperparameters,\nlike the learning rate of the model to be trained. Yet, prior work on\ndifferentially private hyperparameter tuning either uses computationally\nexpensive cryptographic protocols, determines hyperparameters separately for\neach client, or applies differential privacy locally, which can lead to\nundesirable utility-privacy trade-offs.\n  In this work, we present our algorithm DP-HYPE, which performs a distributed\nand privacy-preserving hyperparameter search by conducting a distributed voting\nbased on local hyperparameter evaluations of clients. In this way, DP-HYPE\nselects hyperparameters that lead to a compromise supported by the majority of\nclients, while maintaining scalability and independence from specific learning\ntasks.

Here we show that, despite its remarkable\ncapabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the\nfractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that\nleads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a\ndifferent one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled\nbasins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,\nincluding chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,\nto reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting\nbasins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure\ncharacterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large\nincreases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in\noutcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the\npredictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing\na unified account of many empirical observations.

Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the\nrelease of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership\ninference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership\nInference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled\ninformation-theoretic formulation of membership inference.

    "summary": "We study channel simulation and distributed matching, two fundamental\nproblems with several applications to machine learning, using a recently\nintroduced generalization of the standard rejection sampling (RS) algorithm\nknown as Ensemble Rejection Sampling (ERS). For channel simulation, we propose\na new coding scheme based on ERS that achieves a near-optimal coding rate. In\nthis process, we demonstrate that standard RS can also achieve a near-optimal\ncoding rate and generalize the result of Braverman and Garg (2014) to the\ncontinuous alphabet setting. Next, as our main contribution, we present a\ndistributed matching lemma for ERS, which serves as the rejection sampling\ncounterpart to the Poisson Matching Lemma (PML) introduced by Li and Anantharam\n(2021). Our result also generalizes a recent work on importance matching lemma\n(Phan et al, 2024) and, to our knowledge, is the first result on distributed\nmatching in the family of rejection sampling schemes where the matching\nprobability is close to PML. We demonstrate the practical significance of our\napproach over prior works by applying it to distributed compression. The\neffectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated through experiments involving\nsynthetic Gaussian sources and distributed image compression using the MNIST\ndataset.",

    "summary": "Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising\nfrom data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the\nDivide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training\ndata into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.\nThis strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the\ninfluence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation\ntypically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like\ndata size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying\ngeneralization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce\nDynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that\nrefines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions\nof subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,\nconsidering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent\naggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets\nyielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively\ncombating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning\nmultiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves\ngeneralization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss\ncurves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of\nDUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization\nperformance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,\nestablishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating\noverfitting in modern deep learning.

While promising, existing methods like\nTent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source\nknowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We\nargue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss\nsurface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation\n(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key\nmechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient\nLangevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor\nlocal minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from\ndiverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to\nadapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA\nmethods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo\npasses. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including\nRotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that\nLATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and\nEATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving\naverage accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing\nperformance variance.",

While semi-structured\npruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware\nacceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with\nMatrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.\nInstead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a\n2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These\nwrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,\noffering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional\n2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen\nthrough a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy\nloss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a\nsolution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning\nalgorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and\nQwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide\nrange of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations.

However, accurate\ngraphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one\noften only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this\nissue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve\nestimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a\nlarger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely\nGTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing\nand Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural\npatterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an\nadaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific\ndeviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the\nstability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness\nof GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through\nextensive synthetic and real data experiments.

Rather than directly parameterizing\ncontrols, which does not leverage the Hamiltonian's underlying structure, we\npropose an end-to-end implicit deep learning approach that directly\nparameterizes the value function to learn optimal control laws.

Using\nJacobian-Free Backpropagation (JFB), we achieve efficient training despite\ntemporal coupling in trajectory optimization.

Building on randomized value functions, we propose two\nThompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and\nperforms posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and\n(ii) $\\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and\nemploys prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we\ndevelop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the\nlearned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding\nmeta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the\nsmall-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is\nlearned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain\n$\\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance\n$\\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than\nprior-independent after $K \\gtrsim \\tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \\gtrsim\n\\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation\nenvironment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief\nexploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\\(^+\\) track the meta-oracle and substantially\noutperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results\ngive the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned\nQ-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,\ncovariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.",

    "summary": "Mobile robots, such as ground vehicles and quadrotors, are becoming\nincreasingly important in various fields, from logistics to agriculture, where\nthey automate processes in environments that are difficult to access for\nhumans. However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using\nmodel-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of\nresponding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to\nenvironmental information is limited. To enable such adaptivity and facilitate\nintegration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics\nmodel which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring\noperational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based\non neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to\nlearn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic\nplatforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with\nchanging wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields,\nand the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world\ndeployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally\nand spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world\nsystems.",

Conventional sequential\nimportance resampling (SIR) particle filters suffer from fundamental\nlimitations, in scenarios involving degenerate likelihoods or high-dimensional\nstates, due to the weight degeneracy issue. In this paper, we explore an\nalternative method, which is based on estimating the Brenier optimal transport\n(OT) map from the current prior distribution of the state to the posterior\ndistribution at the next time step. Unlike SIR particle filters, the OT\nformulation does not require the analytical form of the likelihood. Moreover,\nit allows us to harness the approximation power of neural networks to model\ncomplex and multi-modal distributions and employ stochastic optimization\nalgorithms to enhance scalability. Extensive numerical experiments are\npresented that compare the OT method to the SIR particle filter and the\nensemble Kalman filter, evaluating the performance in terms of sample\nefficiency, high-dimensional scalability, and the ability to capture complex\nand multi-modal distributions.",

To this end, this paper first\nidentifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs\nfinetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity: attention is dense within\neach document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and\n(2) query-document block relevance: the attention scores from certain query\ntokens to a document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that\ndocument's actual relevance.

We show that, for hypergraphs and posets with chains of\nlength at most 1, changing the poset of interactions of the probabilistic model\nto one with the same homotopy type induces a bijection between the critical\npoints of the associated free energy. This result extends and unifies classical\nresults that assume specific forms of collapsibility to prove uniqueness of the\ncritical points of the Bethe free energy.",

    "summary": "Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the\ninference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive\nquantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors\nin the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product\nattention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,\nwe propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV\ncache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a\nHadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight\nlinear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by\nquantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3\nmodel families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while\nachieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom\nattention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash\nAttention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.",

    "summary": "Contraction theory is an analytical tool to study differential dynamics of a\nnon-autonomous (i.e., time-varying) nonlinear system under a contraction metric\ndefined with a uniformly positive definite matrix, the existence of which\nresults in a necessary and sufficient characterization of incremental\nexponential stability of multiple solution trajectories with respect to each\nother. By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its\nnonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction\nmetric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix\ninequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known\nlinear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems.\nFurthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness\nproperty of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison\nlemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural\nnetwork-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more\ninvolved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state\nstability. Such distinctive features permit the systematic construction of a\ncontraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit\nexponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and\nsolution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning\nerrors. The objective of this paper is, therefore, to present a tutorial\noverview of contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability\nanalysis of deterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving\nformal robustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and\ndata-driven automatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed\nreview of techniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and\nestimation laws using deep neural networks.",

    "summary": "Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but\noften reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented\ngroups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can\ndisproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.\nAlthough adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard\nclipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce\nSoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard\nclipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient\nmagnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various\ndatasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured\nhealthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip\nreduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%\ncompared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are\nstatistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of\nintegrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and\nprivate model training.",

However,\nsupervised contrastive (SupCon) approaches have received comparatively little\nattention in this context: for instance, while InfoNCE used in SSCL is known to\nform a lower bound on mutual information (MI), the relationship between SupCon\nand MI remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ProjNCE, a\ngeneralization of the InfoNCE loss that unifies supervised and self-supervised\ncontrastive objectives by incorporating projection functions and an adjustment\nterm for negative pairs. We prove that ProjNCE constitutes a valid MI bound and\naffords greater flexibility in selecting projection strategies for class\nembeddings. Building on this flexibility, we further explore the centroid-based\nclass embeddings in SupCon by exploring a variety of projection methods.\nExtensive experiments on image and audio datasets demonstrate that ProjNCE\nconsistently outperforms both SupCon and standard cross-entropy training. Our\nwork thus refines SupCon along two complementary\nperspectives--information-theoretic and projection viewpoints--and offers\nbroadly applicable improvements whenever SupCon serves as the foundational\ncontrastive objective.",

However, computing the exact constant\nis NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve\nsolving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with\nnetwork size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local\ninformation on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We\naddress this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields\ntight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.\nSpecifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly\nflexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing\nLipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary\nchoices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this\ngeneralized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational\ncomplexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also\ndevelop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through\nclosed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied\nby theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a\nseries of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate\nlocal information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms\nachieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing\nsignificantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches.

    "summary": "We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the\noptimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned\nconcurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are\nfully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and\nlearning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To\naddress this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated\nprimal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the\nnaive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving\nparameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new\nlearning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter\ndynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable\nconvergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware\napproach attains a tighter $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from\nan adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem\nadmits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a\nstructured setting achieves an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate\npractical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio\noptimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "title": "Attribute Fusion-based Classifier on Framework of Belief Structure",
    "summary": "Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling\nuncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification\ntasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer\nfrom oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of\nthe belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing\ntheir effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an\nenhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations\nthrough two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that\nutilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership\nfunction construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a\ntailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform\nthe possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from\nnormalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible\nrepresentation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief\nstructure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors\n(EKNN) classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information\ninto decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are\nconducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based\nclassifier and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in\ncomparison with both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning\nclassifiers. The results demonstrate that the proposed classifier outperforms\nthe best existing evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy\nimprovement of 4.86%, while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its\nsuperior effectiveness and robustness.",

Examples of this source separation task\ninclude deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of\nindividual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from\nan ambient background.

Recent advances have shown\nthat diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from\nnoisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve\nthe source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.\nOur method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets\nof observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown\nsources.

In\nthis work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We\nintroduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric\nquantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing\nmechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to\nimprove generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a\nnovel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen\nhairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral\n(MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair\nstyling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model\noutperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen\nhairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling\ntasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error\nand 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world\nexperiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving\nconsistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art\nsystem fails.

Nearly all U.S. cotton is grown in the\nCotton Belt, spanning 17 states in the southern region. Harvesting remains a\ncritical yet challenging stage, impacted by the use of costly, environmentally\nharmful defoliants and heavy, expensive cotton pickers. These factors\ncontribute to yield loss, reduced fiber quality, and soil compaction, which\ncollectively threaten long-term sustainability. To address these issues, this\nstudy proposes a lightweight, small-scale, vision-guided autonomous robotic\ncotton picker as an alternative. An autonomous system, built on Clearpath's\nHusky platform and integrated with the CottonEye perception system, was\ndeveloped and tested in the Gazebo simulation environment. A virtual cotton\nfield was designed to facilitate autonomous navigation testing. The navigation\nsystem used Global Positioning System (GPS) and map-based guidance, assisted by\nan RGBdepth camera and a YOLOv8nseg instance segmentation model. The model\nachieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.2%, a recall of 88.9%, and a\nprecision of 93.0%. The GPS-based approach reached a 100% completion rate (CR)\nwithin a $(5e-6)^{\\circ}$ threshold, while the map-based method achieved a\n96.7% CR within a 0.25 m threshold.

Two autonomous mobile robots (which can move with a maximum speed of 1)\nare initially placed at the origin, while an oblivious moving target is\ninitially placed at a distance $d$ away from the origin. The robots can move\nalong the line in any direction, but the target is oblivious, cannot change\ndirection, and moves either away from or toward the origin at a constant speed\n$v$. Our aim is to design efficient algorithms for the two robots to capture\nthe target. The target is captured only when both robots are co-located with\nit. The robots communicate with each other only face-to-face (F2F), meaning\nthey can exchange information only when co-located, while the target remains\noblivious and has no communication capabilities.\n  We design algorithms under various knowledge scenarios, which take into\naccount the prior knowledge the robots have about the starting distance $d$,\nthe direction of movement (either toward or away from the origin), and the\nspeed $v$ of the target. As a measure of the efficiency of the algorithms, we\nuse the competitive ratio, which is the ratio of the capture time of an\nalgorithm with limited knowledge to the capture time in the full-knowledge\nmodel. In our analysis, we are mindful of the cost of changing direction of\nmovement, and show how to accomplish the capture of the target with at most\nthree direction changes (turns).",

    "summary": "Onboard simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods are commonly\nused to provide accurate localization information for autonomous robots.\nHowever, the coordinate origin of SLAM estimate often resets for each run. On\nthe other hand, UWB-based localization with fixed anchors can ensure a\nconsistent coordinate reference across sessions; however, it requires an\naccurate assignment of the anchor nodes' coordinates. To this end, we propose a\ntwo-stage approach that calibrates and fuses UWB data and SLAM data to achieve\ncoordinate-wise consistent and accurate localization in the same environment.\nIn the first stage, we solve a continuous-time batch optimization problem by\nusing the range and odometry data from one full run, incorporating height\npriors and anchor-to-anchor distance factors to recover the anchors' 3D\npositions. For the subsequent runs in the second stage, a sliding-window\noptimization scheme fuses the UWB and SLAM data, which facilitates accurate\nlocalization in the same coordinate system. Experiments are carried out on the\nNTU VIRAL dataset with six scenarios of UAV flight, and we show that\ncalibration using data in one run is sufficient to enable accurate localization\nin the remaining runs. We release our source code to benefit the community at\nhttps://github.com/ntdathp/slam-uwb-calibration.",

    "summary": "Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are built upon an internal world\nmodel trained via next-frame prediction ``$v_t \\rightarrow v_{t+1}$''. However,\nthis paradigm attempts to predict the future frame's appearance directly,\nwithout explicitly reasoning about the underlying dynamics. \\textbf{This lack\nof an explicit motion reasoning step} often leads to physically implausible\nvisual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce the \\textbf{Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT)}, a paradigm that\ncompels the model to first reason about \\textbf{motion dynamics} before\ngenerating the future frame. We instantiate this paradigm by proposing\n\\textbf{FlowVLA}, an autoregressive Transformer that explicitly materializes\nthis reasoning process as ``$v_t \\rightarrow f_t \\rightarrow v_{t+1}$'', where\n$f_t$ is an intermediate optical flow prediction that inherently encodes\nmotion. By forcing the model to first follow the motion plan encoded by $f_t$,\nthis process inherently \\textbf{aligns the pre-training objective of dynamics\nprediction with the downstream task of action generation.} We conduct\nexperiments on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks, as well as\nreal-robot evaluations.

The conventional control methods coordinate\nthe end-effector pose of each manipulator with that of the other using their\nkinematics and joint coordinate measurements. Yet, the manipulators' inaccurate\nkinematics and joint coordinate measurements can cause significant pose\nsynchronization errors in practice. This paper thus proposes an image-based\nvisual servoing approach for enhancing the cooperation of a dual-arm\nmanipulation system. On top of the classical control, the visual servoing\ncontroller lets each manipulator use its carried camera to measure the image\nfeatures of the other's marker and adapt its end-effector pose with the\ncounterpart on the move. Because visual measurements are robust to kinematic\nerrors, the proposed control can reduce the end-effector pose synchronization\nerrors and the fluctuations of the interaction forces of the pair of\nmanipulators on the move. Theoretical analyses have rigorously proven the\nstability of the closed-loop system. Comparative experiments on real robots\nhave substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed control.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using knowledge graphs to\ninterpret actions and behaviors for robot manipulation control. Equipped with\nan uncalibrated visual servoing controller, we propose to use robot knowledge\ngraphs to unify behavior trees and geometric constraints, conceptualizing robot\nmanipulation control as semantic events. The robot knowledge graphs not only\npreserve the advantages of behavior trees in scripting actions and behaviors,\nbut also offer additional benefits of mapping natural interactions between\nconcepts and events, which enable knowledgeable explanations of the\nmanipulation contexts. Through real-world evaluations, we demonstrate the\nflexibility of the robot knowledge graphs to support explainable robot\nmanipulation control.",

    "summary": "Accurate pose and velocity estimation is essential for effective spatial task\nplanning in robotic manipulators. While centralized sensor fusion has\ntraditionally been used to improve pose estimation accuracy, this paper\npresents a novel decentralized fusion approach to estimate both pose and\nvelocity. We use dual-view measurements from an eye-in-hand and an eye-to-hand\nvision sensor configuration mounted on a manipulator to track a target object\nwhose motion is modeled as random walk (stochastic acceleration model). The\nrobot runs two independent adaptive extended Kalman filters formulated on a\nmatrix Lie group, developed as part of this work. These filters predict poses\nand velocities on the manifold $\\mathbb{SE}(3) \\times \\mathbb{R}^3 \\times\n\\mathbb{R}^3$ and update the state on the manifold $\\mathbb{SE}(3)$. The final\nfused state comprising the fused pose and velocities of the target is obtained\nusing a correlation-aware fusion rule on Lie groups. The proposed method is\nevaluated on a UFactory xArm 850 equipped with Intel RealSense cameras,\ntracking a moving target. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed decentralized dual-view estimation framework,\nshowing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "Verifying the safety of controllers is critical for many applications, but is\nespecially challenging for systems with bounded inputs. Backup control barrier\nfunctions (bCBFs) offer a structured approach to synthesizing safe controllers\nthat are guaranteed to satisfy input bounds by leveraging the knowledge of a\nbackup controller. While powerful, bCBFs require solving a high-dimensional\nquadratic program at run-time, which may be too costly for\ncomputationally-constrained systems such as aerospace vehicles. We propose an\napproach that optimally interpolates between a nominal controller and the\nbackup controller, and we derive the solution to this optimization problem in\nclosed form. We prove that this closed-form controller is guaranteed to be safe\nwhile obeying input bounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on\na double integrator and a nonlinear fixed-wing aircraft example.",

We build a compact,\nhierarchical multi-layer scene graph that can represent large, complex indoor\nenvironments at various levels of abstraction, e.g., nodes corresponding to\nrooms, objects, walls, windows etc. as well as fine-grained details of their\ngeometry. We develop a procedure based on large language models (LLMs) to\nsample plausible scene graphs of unobserved regions that are consistent with\npartial observations of the scene. These samples are used to compute an\ninformation gain of a potential waypoint for sophisticated spatial reasoning,\ne.g., the two doors in the living room can lead to either a kitchen or a\nbedroom. We evaluate this approach in complex, realistic 3D indoor environments\nin simulation. We show using qualitative and quantitative experiments that our\napproach can pin down the semantics of the environment quicker and more\naccurately than baseline approaches.",

    "summary": "Work environments are often inadequate and lack inclusivity for individuals\nwith upper-body disabilities. This paper presents a novel online framework for\nadaptive human-robot interaction (HRI) that accommodates users' arm mobility\nimpairments, ultimately aiming to promote active work participation. Unlike\ntraditional human-robot collaboration approaches that assume able-bodied users,\nour method integrates a mobility model for specific joint limitations into a\nhierarchical optimal controller. This allows the robot to generate reactive,\nmobility-aware behaviour online and guides the user's impaired limb to exploit\nresidual functional mobility. The framework was tested in handover tasks\ninvolving different upper-limb mobility impairments (i.e., emulated elbow and\nshoulder arthritis, and wrist blockage), under both standing and seated\nconfigurations with task constraints using a mobile manipulator, and\ncomplemented by quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art\nergonomic HRI approaches. Preliminary results indicated that the framework can\npersonalise the interaction to fit within the user's impaired range of motion\nand encourage joint usage based on the severity of their functional\nlimitations.",

    "summary": "Tactile sensing holds great promise for enhancing manipulation precision and\nversatility, but its adoption in robotic hands remains limited due to high\nsensor costs, manufacturing and integration challenges, and difficulties in\nextracting expressive and reliable information from signals. In this work, we\npresent a low-cost, easy-to-make, adaptable, and compact fingertip design for\nrobotic hands that integrates multi-modal tactile sensors. We use strain gauge\nsensors to capture static forces and a contact microphone sensor to measure\nhigh-frequency vibrations during contact. These tactile sensors are integrated\ninto a compact design with a minimal sensor footprint, and all sensors are\ninternal to the fingertip and therefore not susceptible to direct wear and tear\nfrom interactions. From sensor characterization, we show that strain gauge\nsensors provide repeatable 2D planar force measurements in the 0-5 N range and\nthe contact microphone sensor has the capability to distinguish contact\nmaterial properties. We apply our design to three dexterous manipulation tasks\nthat range from zero to full visual occlusion. Given the expressiveness and\nreliability of tactile sensor readings, we show that different tactile sensing\nmodalities can be used flexibly in different stages of manipulation, solely or\ntogether with visual observations to achieve improved task performance. For\ninstance, we can precisely count and unstack a desired number of paper cups\nfrom a stack with 100\\% success rate which is hard to achieve with vision only.",

    "title": "Decremental Dynamics Planning for Robot Navigation",
    "summary": "Most, if not all, robot navigation systems employ a decomposed planning\nframework that includes global and local planning. To trade-off onboard\ncomputation and plan quality, current systems have to limit all robot dynamics\nconsiderations only within the local planner, while leveraging an extremely\nsimplified robot representation (e.g., a point-mass holonomic model without\ndynamics) in the global level. However, such an artificial decomposition based\non either full or zero consideration of robot dynamics can lead to gaps between\nthe two levels, e.g., a global path based on a holonomic point-mass model may\nnot be realizable by a non-holonomic robot, especially in highly constrained\nobstacle environments. Motivated by such a limitation, we propose a novel\nparadigm, Decremental Dynamics Planning that integrates dynamic constraints\ninto the entire planning process, with a focus on high-fidelity dynamics\nmodeling at the beginning and a gradual fidelity reduction as the planning\nprogresses. To validate the effectiveness of this paradigm, we augment three\ndifferent planners with DDP and show overall improved planning performance. We\nalso develop a new DDP-based navigation system, which achieves first place in\nthe simulation phase of the 2025 BARN Challenge. Both simulated and physical\nexperiments validate DDP's hypothesized benefits.",

    "summary": "Underwater ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) are unmanned submersible\nvehicles designed for exploring and operating in the depths of the ocean.\nDespite using high-end cameras, typical teleoperation engines based on\nfirst-person (egocentric) views limit a surface operator's ability to maneuver\nthe ROV in complex deep-water missions. In this paper, we present an\ninteractive teleoperation interface that enhances the operational capabilities\nvia increased situational awareness. This is accomplished by (i) offering\non-demand \"third\"-person (exocentric) visuals from past egocentric views, and\n(ii) facilitating enhanced peripheral information with augmented ROV pose\ninformation in real-time. We achieve this by integrating a 3D geometry-based\nEgo-to-Exo view synthesis algorithm into a monocular SLAM system for accurate\ntrajectory estimation. The proposed closed-form solution only uses past\negocentric views from the ROV and a SLAM backbone for pose estimation, which\nmakes it portable to existing ROV platforms. Unlike data-driven solutions, it\nis invariant to applications and waterbody-specific scenes. We validate the\ngeometric accuracy of the proposed framework through extensive experiments of\n2-DOF indoor navigation and 6-DOF underwater cave exploration in challenging\nlow-light conditions. A subjective evaluation on 15 human teleoperators further\nconfirms the effectiveness of the integrated features for improved\nteleoperation. We demonstrate the benefits of dynamic Ego-to-Exo view\ngeneration and real-time pose rendering for remote ROV teleoperation by\nfollowing navigation guides such as cavelines inside underwater caves. This new\nway of interactive ROV teleoperation opens up promising opportunities for\nfuture research in subsea telerobotics.",

    "title": "Adaptive Dynamics Planning for Robot Navigation",
    "summary": "Autonomous robot navigation systems often rely on hierarchical planning,\nwhere global planners compute collision-free paths without considering\ndynamics, and local planners enforce dynamics constraints to produce executable\ncommands. This discontinuity in dynamics often leads to trajectory tracking\nfailure in highly constrained environments. Recent approaches integrate\ndynamics within the entire planning process by gradually decreasing its\nfidelity, e.g., increasing integration steps and reducing collision checking\nresolution, for real-time planning efficiency. However, they assume that the\nfidelity of the dynamics should decrease according to a manually designed\nscheme. Such static settings fail to adapt to environmental complexity\nvariations, resulting in computational overhead in simple environments or\ninsufficient dynamics consideration in obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose Adaptive Dynamics Planning (ADP), a\nlearning-augmented paradigm that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically\nadjust robot dynamics properties, enabling planners to adapt across diverse\nenvironments. We integrate ADP into three different planners and further design\na standalone ADP-based navigation system, benchmarking them against other\nbaselines. Experiments in both simulation and real-world tests show that ADP\nconsistently improves navigation success, safety, and efficiency.",

    "summary": "Humanoid whole-body locomotion control is a critical approach for humanoid\nrobots to leverage their inherent advantages. Learning-based control methods\nderived from retargeted human motion data provide an effective means of\naddressing this issue. However, because most current human datasets lack\nmeasured force data, and learning-based robot control is largely\nposition-based, achieving appropriate compliance during interaction with real\nenvironments remains challenging. This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline\n(CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based\nstructure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning\nframework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is\nproposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based\ncontroller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is\ncombined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is\nguided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space\ncompliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through\ncompliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold,\nensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed\nstrategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external\ndisturbances under different compliance settings.",
