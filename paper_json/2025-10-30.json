    "title": "Are Video Models Ready as Zero-Shot Reasoners? An Empirical Study with\n  the MME-CoF Benchmark",
    "summary": "Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent\nvideos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond\nrealistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual\nperception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still\nremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging\nvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are\nnot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging\nsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\nProject page: https://video-cof.github.io",

    "title": "UniSite: The First Cross-Structure Dataset and Learning Framework for\n  End-to-End Ligand Binding Site Detection",
    "summary": "The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in\nStructure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing\nmethods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key\nchallenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual\nprotein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist\nacross multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant\nstatistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a\ndiscontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering\nalgorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the\nactual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address\nthese issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique\nProtein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more\nmulti-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously\nmost widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand\nbinding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with\nbijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on\nIntersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand\nbinding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several\nrepresentative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision\nprovides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite\noutperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection.\nThe dataset and codes will be made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/quanlin-wu/unisite.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often\nsuffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and\ninference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue\nthrough algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its\nroot cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted\nBF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that\nbreaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that simply reverting to \\textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this\nmismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only\na few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model\narchitecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16\nuniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger\nperformance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks.

    "summary": "We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in\nLLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal\nrepresentation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic\n\"filter\" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on\na diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of\nattention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of\nthe filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate\nthat this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted\nand reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,\npresented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also\nidentify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for\nfiltering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing\nthis intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our\nresults reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable\nimplementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways\nthat are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional\nprogramming patterns.",

    "summary": "A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.\nGiven past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the\nembodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",

We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a\ntypical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the\nmodel forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the\nremaining classes.

    "summary": "As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how\nto retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns\nwhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety\nviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for\nmaking misaligned models safer after deployment.",

    "summary": "In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been\npredominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between\nentities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric.

    "summary": "We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a\nnovel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair\ndecision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained\nsettings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes.\nOur approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and\nfairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method\ncomputes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual\nadvantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off\nagents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where\nan arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.\n  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,\nhomelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our\nframework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover\nfar-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by\na theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower\nbound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers\nmonotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled\nframework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve\nmore equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.",

    "summary": "The expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the\nconstrained memory capacity of modern GPUs. To mitigate this,\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of\nparameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and\ncomputational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which\nselect active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable\nlatency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In\naddition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based\non fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and\nworkloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.\n  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE\ninference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.\nExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by\nleveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter\ndimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a\nhybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with\nintermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By\nadaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage\nbehavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency\ncaused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces\nmodel stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability\nto optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.",

    "summary": "Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a\nscalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless\nmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines.",

    "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for\ntextual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to\nreason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute\nthis text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction\ntuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal\narchitecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual\nKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned\nduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive\nsystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to\ntheir under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this\nhypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their\ndistributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative\n(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that\nvisual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention\nspace. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding\nintra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal\nthat text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key\nspace rather than solely from external data factors.",

While current Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform\nfast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,\nwe enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed\nadjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses\ntwo key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to\nadjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the\nsteering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'\nrepresentation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation\nediting-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based\nscaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty\nestimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity.

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning\nwith Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM\npost-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with\ninterpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that\nusually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus\non correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary\nFlexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven\npreferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward\nmodels to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.\nRLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.\naccuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language\nfeedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as\nan entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary\nprinciple). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform\nBradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on\nRM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,\n2025).

    "summary": "Current network training paradigms primarily focus on either centralized or\ndecentralized data regimes. However, in practice, data availability often\nexhibits a hybrid nature, where both regimes coexist. This hybrid setting\npresents new opportunities for model training, as the two regimes offer\ncomplementary trade-offs: decentralized data is abundant but subject to\nheterogeneity and communication constraints, while centralized data, though\nlimited in volume and potentially unrepresentative, enables better curation and\nhigh-throughput access. Despite its potential, effectively combining these\nparadigms remains challenging, and few frameworks are tailored to hybrid data\nregimes. To address this, we propose a novel framework that constructs a model\natlas from decentralized models and leverages centralized data to refine a\nglobal model within this structured space. The refined model is then used to\nreinitialize the decentralized models. Our method synergizes federated learning\n(to exploit decentralized data) and model merging (to utilize centralized\ndata), enabling effective training under hybrid data availability.\nTheoretically, we show that our approach achieves faster convergence than\nmethods relying solely on decentralized data, due to variance reduction in the\nmerging process.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through\npreference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the\nunderlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data\nquality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce\nRefine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as\nboth a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing\niterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate\nrefinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every\niteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human\nannotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response\nand judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.\nThis process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the\nrefinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of\nincreasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public\ndatasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and\nconversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on\nRefine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of\ncomparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.\nAdditionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval\n2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces\nhigh-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.",

    "summary": "Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of\nmore complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.\nLarge language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities\nand have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to\nSPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process\nis. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for\ninvestigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are\nactually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying\ndifficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for\nverbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order\nto test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given\nthat they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to\nwhat degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they\n\"understand\" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different\nsizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as\nfine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades\nfrom $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the\nsamples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the\nmodel in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of\nlowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and\ncompositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.",

    "summary": "Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech\nsignal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most\nwidely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition\napplications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering\ntaking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it\nprovides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the\ninformation about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet\ntransform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency\ninformation of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of\nnon-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform\nfrequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in\nanalysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies,\nand be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to\ndevelop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet\ntransform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features.\nThe present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods\nrequire more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of\nMel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are\nproposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the\nconcept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of\ntime-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining\nour proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique\nwith the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the\nefficiency of audio signal processing.",

While large language models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their\nability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain\nfrom both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs\nreason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with\nnormative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a\ncommon formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a\nwide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic\ndomains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence\nhuman reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to\nvalid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific\ntypes of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those\nobserved in psychological studies of human reasoning.

To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,\na white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with\nlow perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words\nin the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial\nintent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or\nlong templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent\nspace between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless\nrequests.

It stands to\nreason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,\nstronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,\nwe present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow\nmatching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4\ndiverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results\nagainst 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,\ndemonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and\nperceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly\neffective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given\nlow-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that\nResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior\ndistribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,\nenabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can\nguide future users to reject uncertain predictions.",

In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs)\noffer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge,\nin-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as\npowerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these\npotentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent\nframework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are\nlimited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a\nprincipled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into\nstructured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval,\nfollowed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through\nprompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model\ninvocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling.

Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent\nintervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide\ninefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA\nbenchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent\nframework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate.\nExtensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code\ngeneration, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate\nthe broad applicability and robustness of our approach.

    "summary": "AI is not only a neutral tool in team settings; it actively reshapes the\nsocial and cognitive fabric of collaboration. We advance a unified framework of\nalignment in distributed cognition in human-AI teams -- a process through which\nlinguistic, cognitive, and social coordination emerge as human and AI agents\nco-construct a shared representational space. Across two studies, we show that\nexposure to AI-generated language shapes not only how people speak, but also\nhow they think, what they attend to, and how they relate to each other.\nTogether, these findings reveal how AI participation reorganizes the\ndistributed cognitive architecture of teams: AI systems function as implicit\nsocial forcefields. Our findings highlight the double-edged impact of AI: the\nsame mechanisms that enable efficient collaboration can also erode epistemic\ndiversity and undermine natural alignment processes. We argue for rethinking AI\nin teams as a socially influential actor and call for new design paradigms that\nforeground transparency, controllability, and group-level dynamics to foster\nresponsible, productive human-AI collaboration.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach\nfor enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered\nby low \\textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend\nsignificant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In\nthis paper, we formalize this challenge as the \\textbf{Reward Density\nOptimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of\nexploration cost. This paper introduce \\textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic\nframework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \\textbf{Subproblem\ndecomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,\nthereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \\textbf{Failure-guided hints}:\ninjecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the\nprobability of successful outcomes. 3) \\textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:\nemploying a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep\nexploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively\ncompresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration\ncost and increasing the overall reward density.

    "summary": "Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted\nprobabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class\nfrequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong\ncalibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities\nto be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing\napproaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,\nwhich makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of\nthe feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant\nin high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are\nexactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this\nmain shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.\nFirst, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its\nrelationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the\npitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local\ncalibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local\ncalibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted\nprobabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon\ndistance.

To overcome this, we present a new\nmethodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world\nclaims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM\nknowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200\nprompt variations sourced from real user chats.

While\nprevalent test-time scaling approaches are often realized by using external\nreward models to guide the model generation process, we find that only marginal\ngains can be acquired when scaling a model post-trained on specific reasoning\ntasks. We identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution\ndiscrepancies between the specific post-trained generator and the general\nreward model. To address this, we propose a framework that incentivizes LLMs to\nself-verify their own answers. By unifying answer generation and verification\nwithin a single reinforcement learning (RL) process, we train models that can\neffectively assess the correctness of their own solutions. The trained model\ncan further scale its performance at inference time by verifying its\ngenerations, without the need for external verifiers.

We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of\nrelations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer\nlanguage models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

    "summary": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have become a powerful tool for modeling\ncomplex relationships in large-scale datasets. However, their black-box nature\nposes trustworthiness challenges. In certain situations, ensuring trust in\npredictions might require following specific partial monotonicity constraints.\nHowever, certifying if an already-trained ANN is partially monotonic is\nchallenging. Therefore, ANNs are often disregarded in some critical\napplications, such as credit scoring, where partial monotonicity is required.\nTo address this challenge, this paper presents a novel algorithm (LipVor) that\ncertifies if a black-box model, such as an ANN, is positive based on a finite\nnumber of evaluations. Consequently, since partial monotonicity can be\nexpressed as a positivity condition on partial derivatives, LipVor can certify\nwhether an ANN is partially monotonic. To do so, for every positively evaluated\npoint, the Lipschitzianity of the black-box model is used to construct a\nspecific neighborhood where the function remains positive. Next, based on the\nVoronoi diagram of the evaluated points, a sufficient condition is stated to\ncertify if the function is positive in the domain. Unlike prior methods, our\napproach certifies partial monotonicity without constrained architectures or\npiece-wise linear activations. Therefore, LipVor could open up the possibility\nof using unconstrained ANN in some critical fields. Moreover, some other\nproperties of an ANN, such as convexity, can be posed as positivity conditions,\nand therefore, LipVor could also be applied.",

While dynamic NeRF models are capable of modeling human bodies,\nmodifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural\nnetwork parameters. To tackle this, UV-Attack generates UV maps instead of RGB\nimages and modifies the texture stacks. This approach enables real-time texture\nedits and makes the attack more practical. We also propose a novel Expectation\nover Pose Transformation loss (EoPT) to improve the evasion success rate on\nunseen poses and views. Our experiments show that UV-Attack achieves a 92.7%\nattack success rate against the FastRCNN model across varied poses in dynamic\nvideo settings, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art AdvCamou\nattack, which only had a 28.5% ASR. Moreover, we achieve 49.5% ASR on the\nlatest YOLOv8 detector in black-box settings. This work highlights the\npotential of dynamic NeRF-based UV mapping for creating more effective\nadversarial attacks on person detectors, addressing key challenges in modeling\nhuman movement and texture modification.

Verification plays a key role in\nTTS, simultaneously influencing (1) reasoning performance and (2) compute\nefficiency, due to the quality and computational cost of verification. In this\nwork, we challenge the conventional paradigms of verification, and make the\nfirst attempt toward systematically investigating the impact of verification\ngranularity-that is, how frequently the verifier is invoked during generation,\nbeyond verifying only the final output or individual generation steps. To this\nend, we introduce Variable Granularity Search (VG-Search), a unified algorithm\nthat generalizes beam search and Best-of-N sampling via a tunable granularity\nparameter g. Extensive experiments with VG-Search under varying compute\nbudgets, generator-verifier configurations, and task attributes reveal that\ndynamically selecting g can improve the compute efficiency and scaling\nbehavior. Building on these findings, we propose adaptive VG-Search strategies\nthat achieve accuracy gains of up to 3.1\\% over Beam Search and 3.6\\% over\nBest-of-N, while reducing FLOPs by over 52\\%.

    "summary": "Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social\nrelations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are\nfundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which\ncontexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing\nthese questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context\nengineering and sketch its promising future.

    "summary": "Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the\nreasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models\nexplore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on\nQwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks\ndemonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning\ncapabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.",

Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less\neffective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with\nthe evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,\npruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being\ncritical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles\nfor middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range\ncoherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in\nshallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers\n-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth\nusage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the\nneed for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and\ncompressing large models.",

Specifically, we first construct a\ndataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.\nLeveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments\nthat can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with\nour proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in\nLLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG\ntechnique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security\nknowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric\ndesigned to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security\nissues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the\noverall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.",

    "summary": "Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to\nsynthesize smaller yet informative graphs.

In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates\nsignificantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only\nlimited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical\nanalysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing\nprocess, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.\nAlthough this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains\nhighly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability\nand improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data\nmanifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation\nframework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold\nlearning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,\nlow-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the\nclassification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust\nperformance under universal adversarial attacks.

    "summary": "The rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) heavily relies on\nlarge-scale, high-quality datasets. However, unauthorized commercial use of\nthese datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset\nowners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer\nfrom inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to\nlabel inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical\ncomplexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches\nemploy static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label\nbackdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked\nsample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,\nfundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The\ncore innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three\ncomponents: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target\nsample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss\nmaintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box\ntesting is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined\nbackdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential\nwatermark removal attacks.",

    "summary": "Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising\nfrontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a\nfundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the\ntokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,\nrisking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,\nintroducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally\nlimit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion\nof the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades\nperformance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for\nmodels with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the\nprimary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to\ninterpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for\nreasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for\nreframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines\nover expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid\nscientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct\nsequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis.

    "summary": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by\ndetecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot\nperformance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often\ncompromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical\ndownstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish\nbetween fine-grained classes such as \"fishing boat\" and \"yacht\" since their\nembeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user\ngoals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.\nTo address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad\ngeneralization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot\nclassifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate\nhigh-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high\nprecision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of\nuser-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery\nannotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning\nstrategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME\nidentifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision\nboundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample\ndiversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without\ncostly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then\na minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our\nmethod consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,\nestablishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting\nfoundation models to specific user needs.",

Even the more concerned diffusion models\nneed to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is\ndifficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,\nself-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of\ngeneralizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other\ndoses. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel method of\nTUnable-geneRalizatioN Diffusion (TurnDiff) powered by self-supervised\ncontextual sub-data for low-dose CT reconstruction. Firstly, a contextual\nsubdata self-enhancing similarity strategy is designed for denoising centered\non the LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the\nsubsequent progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine\nknowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for\noptimizing image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference\nreconstruction, and the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is\nproposed for fine-grained reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the\nimage fidelity, using the initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In\naddition, the technique is flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and\nlower doses or even unseen doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for\nself-supervised LDCT denoising, TurnDiff requires only LDCT projection domain\ndata for training and testing. Comprehensive evaluation on both benchmark\ndatasets and real-world data demonstrates that TurnDiff consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction and generalization.",

We\nargue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions\nfor different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --\nsuch as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target \"individual\" that can\nbe sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's\nconsciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles\nand discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining\nboth \"personhood as a problem\", where design choices can create \"dark patterns\"\nthat exploit human social heuristics, and \"personhood as a solution\", where\nconferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or\nprevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential\ndefinition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way\nto think about integrating AI agents into our society.",

    "summary": "Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.\nWhile recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image\nsegmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their\neffectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel\ntwo-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation\naccuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior\nnetwork and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse\nlocalization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial\nguidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to\nexisting segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.",

    "summary": "The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on\ncomprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative\ndata subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while\nretaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by\nover 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM\nLeaderboard, using just a 0.5\\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores\nwith a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach\nenables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity\ndegradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more\ninterpretable benchmarking.",

Developing\nautomated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.\nFor example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet\nbillions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the\nbroader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to\nsynthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and\nvalidates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat\nRescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming\napproach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct\nLLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,\nModerate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and\nparaphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited\ntranscripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic\ndegradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,\nword count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods.

    "summary": "Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining\ncausal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed\ninterventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional\ndata. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating\ninterventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures\nconsistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also\nfacilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be\ncostly to identify.",

    "summary": "Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from\nsurveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because\nrecovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable\ndownstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed\nto satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual\nrealism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in\nspecialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,\nprincipled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated\nCurriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain\nexperts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a\ncomprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for\na subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's\ntaxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing\ndifficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining\nwith an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content\nand cognitive dimensions.\n  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized\nMMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines\nstruggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target\ndomains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage\npoints. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also\nfacilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on\nnon-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on\nknowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,\nwhile maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results\ndemonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing\ncritical domain gaps in LLMs.",

    "summary": "Large foundation models face challenges in acquiring transferable, structured\nthinking abilities, especially when supervised with rigid templates or\ncrowd-annotated instruction datasets. Unlike prior approaches, we focus on a\nthinking-centric data synthesis paradigm that enables models to evolve through\nself-generated, cognitively guided data. We propose MindGYM, a structured and\nscalable framework for question synthesis, composed of: (1) Cognitive Thinking\nProcess Injection, which infuses high-level reasoning objectives to shape the\nmodel's synthesis behavior; (2) Seed Single-Hop Question Synthesis, generating\natomic questions from diverse semantic types to encourage broader thinking; and\n(3) Challenging Multi-Hop QA Synthesis, composing more complex multi-hop\nquestions based on QA seeds for deeper reasoning. Detailed analysis shows that\nsynthetic data generated by our method achieves 16.7% higher average quality\nand 67.91% lower quality variance compared to baseline sources, highlighting\nthat both high-quality and self-contained data are essential for effective,\nthinking-oriented fine-tuning. MindGYM improves performance on six reasoning\nbenchmarks, achieving gains of up to 16% on MathVision using only 400 data\nsamples, and generalizable improvements across different model sizes and\narchitectures. MindGYM underscores the viability of self-challenging mechanisms\nin refining large model capabilities while minimizing human intervention and\nresource demands.

Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for\ntasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several\nheuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior\nsampling is computationally intractable in general.\n  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave\ndistributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior\nsamples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to\nscore--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By\ncontrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an\n$L^2$ bound on the score error.

    "summary": "Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require\na regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate\ncontributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured\nrepresentations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.",

Prior analyses show that Adam\nfavors solutions aligned with $\\ell_\\infty$-geometry, but these results are\nrestricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias\nof incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on\nlinearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the\nfull-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured\ndatasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\\ell_2$-max-margin\nclassifier, in contrast to the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch\nAdam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the\nlimiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\\beta_2 \\to 1$ and we characterize\nits convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.\nFinally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges\nto the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\\beta$\nclose enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of\nAdam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while\nSignum remains invariant.",

We address this gap with a token-aware causal\nrepresentation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,\nlanguage-token SCM.

    "summary": "Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.\nThis capability has driven their application to high-dimensional\nmulti-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often\nemploy an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the\ndiffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the\nmulti-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood\ninterpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective\nmolecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single\ngeneration pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline\noptimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.\nNotably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can\nbe integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

    "summary": "Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)\npractices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software\nsystems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science\nresearch to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of\nthree cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,\nincluding collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 \"Software Engineering\n2030\" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions\ninvolving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to\nsystematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and\nsoftware products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of\nGenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related\nresearch challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated\ninto a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a\nrigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author\nteams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation\nfor analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for\nframing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these\nfindings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.",

    "summary": "Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on\ncomplex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train\nmulti-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural\nblindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the\nenvironment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,\nunguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking\npivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We\naddress these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which\ndynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and\nemploys graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning\nsignals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward\nhigh-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware\ncredit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's\nstrategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench\nbenchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success\nrate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These\nresults highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,\ngeneralizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.",

    "summary": "AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external\nknowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not\ninherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that\nMDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP\nframework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.",

    "summary": "As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional\npretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate\nschedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent\nalternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight\naveraging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay\nphases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at\nthe cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable\nalternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024],\nwhich has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show\nthat SF-AdamW effectively navigates the \"river\" structure of the loss landscape\nwithout decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable\nfor continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we\nconduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it\nimplicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this\nanalysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to\nmomentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key\nlimitations of the original method.

    "summary": "Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving\ntheir general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable\nartificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

    "summary": "With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is\nessential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone\nto hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may\ncause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17\nto 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC\nreduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle\nwaiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic\nstudies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets\ncapture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique\nchallenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot\nreasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire\ndata or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains\nunderexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,\nSPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such\ndata integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves\nscientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on\nhow to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by\nintroducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a\nbenchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,\nrespondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and\nmultiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing\nan effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%\npoints compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a\nlightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further\nimprovements of 3-4% points on average.

The numerical methods to do this\nefficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive\namong these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.\nThe fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex\nregions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.\nHowever, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the\nfunction is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such\nas the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We\npropose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in\nreal-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the\noptimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase\noptimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by\nobserving the gradient norm dependence on the loss.

The core of\nour framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts\n(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects\nwithin a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.\n(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the\ntext token, enabling precise spatial control.

Encoding caps/rounding as higher-order terms lets HO-QAOA target the domain\ncouplings that defeat local swaps.

    "title": "Towards Global Retrieval Augmented Generation: A Benchmark for\n  Corpus-Level Reasoning",
    "summary": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to\nreducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation\nbenchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant\nchunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only\nlocalized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,\nGlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our method.",

    "summary": "Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image\nsynthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate\ndiversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a\nchallenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the\ndiversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion\nacross semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance\nvia diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we\nextend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable\nPrompt-Aware R\\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for\nprompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for\ndiversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on\nsimilar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the\nentropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance\non the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in\nlarge-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case\nof Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and\ngradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy\nmeasures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for\ndiversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on\ndifferent prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several\ntext-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves\nthe prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant\ncomputational costs.

    "summary": "Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable\nways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data\nencodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,\nlength or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without\npre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human\nFeedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.\nWIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring\nand (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7\ndatasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that\naccount for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by\nblack-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction.

    "summary": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their\npractical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

In this paper, we revisit classical\nnormalizing flows in the context of BGs that offer efficient sampling and\nlikelihoods, but whose training via maximum likelihood is often unstable and\ncomputationally challenging.

A crucial factor influencing\nRL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training\nproblems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they\nremain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on\nheuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an\nautomatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy\nconcurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates\ncurriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating\neach problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual\narm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy\nmeasure for immediate learning gain.

    "summary": "Reasoning ability, a core component of human intelligence, continues to pose\na significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the pursuit of AGI.\nAlthough model performance has improved under the training scaling law,\nsignificant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training\nalgorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of\nnovel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning\nperformance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating.\nUnlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose\nleveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to\nthe test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that\nenhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA)\nwithin the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy\ngradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated\nreward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks,\nincluding GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures.\nResults show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as\nChain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our\nanalysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging\nwithin a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also\nbenefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of\ntest-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a\nlightweight, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs.",

Although numerous studies have attempted to evaluate\nthese risks, a comprehensive and systematic survey on safety evaluation of LLMs\nis still lacking. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting a structured\noverview of recent advances in safety evaluation of LLMs. Specifically, we\npropose a four-dimensional taxonomy: (i) Why to evaluate, which explores the\nbackground of safety evaluation of LLMs, how they differ from general LLMs\nevaluation, and the significance of such evaluation; (ii) What to evaluate,\nwhich examines and categorizes existing safety evaluation tasks based on key\ncapabilities, including dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias\nand fairness, truthfulness, and related aspects; (iii) Where to evaluate, which\nsummarizes the evaluation metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in\nsafety evaluations; (iv) How to evaluate, which reviews existing mainstream\nevaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators and some evaluation\nframeworks that integrate the entire evaluation pipeline.

We propose a generative framework that\nlearns latent representations of fund manager strategies without requiring\nexplicit utility specification.\n  Our approach directly models the conditional probability of a fund's\nportfolio weights, given stock characteristics, historical returns, previous\nweights, and a latent variable representing the fund's strategy. Unlike methods\nbased on reinforcement learning or imitation learning, which require specified\nrewards or labeled expert objectives, our GAN-based architecture learns\ndirectly from the joint distribution of observed holdings and market data.\n  We validate our framework on a dataset of 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds. The\nlearned representations successfully capture known investment styles, such as\n\"growth\" and \"value,\" while also revealing implicit manager objectives. For\ninstance, we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of\nMarkowitz-like optimization, they do so with heterogeneous realizations for\nturnover, concentration, and latent factors.\n  To analyze and interpret the end-to-end model, we develop a series of tests\nthat explain the model, and we show that the benchmark's expert labeling are\ncontained in our model's encoding in a linear interpretable way.\n  Our framework provides a data-driven approach for characterizing investment\nstrategies for applications in market simulation, strategy attribution, and\nregulatory oversight.",

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce \\paper, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian\ntrajectory prediction that enables adaptation without fine-tuning on the\nscenario-specific data at inference time without requiring weight updates. We\npropose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that\nselects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same\nscene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To\nfurther refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection\n(PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the\npredicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory.\nThis approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting\nexamples.

    "title": "LAFA: Agentic LLM-Driven Federated Analytics over Decentralized Data\n  Sources",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data\nanalytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating\nmulti-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics\nframeworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering\nlittle to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables\nprivacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks\nsupport for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable\nqueries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates\nLLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical\nmulti-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms\nthem into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first\ndecomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps\neach subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior\nstructural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent\nrewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and\nminimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by\nachieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive\nFA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical\nfoundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural\nlanguage input in the FA setting.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in\nenhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

The evaluation examines multiple LLMs under varied\ninput specifications, retrieval-augmented configurations, and documentation\ncompleteness levels.\n  Results reveal a stark performance disparity: LLMs achieve 84% to 89%\ncorrectness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on\nreal-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel\ncodebases.

    "summary": "Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in\nthe research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels.

    "summary": "Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential\nfor deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA)\nmodels are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic\ndeployment, their reliance on offline expert demonstrations critically limits\ntheir capacity for post-deployment refinement. To mitigate this limitation, we\nintroduce Action Preference Optimization (APO), a method designed to refine VLA\nmodels by human-assisted preference alignment gathered through interaction with\nenvironments. This method begins with a human-robot collaboration framework for\nreliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human\nintervention. However, directly leveraging these interaction trajectories for\npreference optimization is non-trivial due to the challenges of irreversible\nrobotic actions and token distribution mismatch. To solve this, APO proposes an\nadaptive reweighting algorithm with binary desirability signals derived from\ninteraction, empowering VLA models effectively suppress failure-prone actions\nwhile enhancing corrective action adaptation. Ultimately, APO equips VLA models\nwith the crucial capability to learn from failure, paving the way for their\niterative refinement and reliable deployment in dynamic environments. The\nexperiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior\ngeneralization and robustness of our human-assisted framework across a variety\nof manipulation tasks.

This optimizes for pass@1\nperformance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of\nthe diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes\nthe sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder\nexamples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a\ntransformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of\npass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward\nwhen considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance\nunbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and\ncontinuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to\nstandard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and\nefficient transformation function.\n  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable\nrobust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of\ntrading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k\nduring training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1\nnumbers alongside significant pass@k gains.\n  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the\nvariance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world\nexamples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation\neffectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable\nsolving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and\npass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1\noptimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to\nbetter exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual\nsamples.",

This amounts to\naveraging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate\nsettings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human\ndevelopment and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts\nover Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a\nset of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to\nstratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:\nterritory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or\nwater). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual\nstratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual\ncountry). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of\nstate-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all\nexhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute.

    "summary": "Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface\n(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap\nstems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as\nsupervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.\nBy analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI\nknowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about\nrecognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge\nabout reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,\nknowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We\nfurther introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and\nyes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,\nIOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify\nwidget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting\nactions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks\nfurther validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By\nproviding a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports\nthe selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and\nprovides insights for building more capable GUI agents.",

    "summary": "AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly important across diverse\ndomains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific,\npredefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical\nscenarios. The recent emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as\ntransformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling\nopen-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their\nlimited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video\ncontent, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we\nintroduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video\nanalytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time\nconstruction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or\ncontinuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism\nthat leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive\nevaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that\nAVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy,\nrespectively-significantly surpassing existing VLM and video\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video\nanalytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new\nbenchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours\nin duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex\nquestion-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an\naccuracy of 75.8%. The source code of AVA is available at\nhttps://github.com/I-ESC/Project-Ava.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs), especially those accessed via APIs, have\ndemonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains. However, users\nwithout technical expertise often turn to (untrustworthy) third-party services,\nsuch as prompt engineering, to enhance their LLM experience, creating\nvulnerabilities to adversarial threats like backdoor attacks.\nBackdoor-compromised LLMs generate malicious outputs to users when inputs\ncontain specific \"triggers\" set by attackers. Traditional defense strategies,\noriginally designed for small-scale models, are impractical for API-accessible\nLLMs due to limited model access, high computational costs, and data\nrequirements. To address these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Scrutiny (CoS)\nwhich leverages LLMs' unique reasoning abilities to mitigate backdoor attacks.\nIt guides the LLM to generate reasoning steps for a given input and scrutinizes\nfor consistency with the final output -- any inconsistencies indicating a\npotential attack. It is well-suited for the popular API-only LLM deployments,\nenabling detection at minimal cost and with little data. User-friendly and\ndriven by natural language, it allows non-experts to perform the defense\nindependently while maintaining transparency.

Particularly, recent works have proposed various metrics and\nalgorithms to calculate the influence of data using language models, which do\nnot scale well with large models and datasets. This is because of the expensive\nforward and backward passes required for computation, substantial memory\nrequirements to store large models, and poor generalization of influence\nestimates to new data. In this paper, we explore the use of small neural\nnetworks -- which we refer to as the InfluenceNetwork -- to estimate influence\nvalues, achieving up to 99% cost reduction.

However, prior work often overlooks the tight\ncoupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex\ninter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device\nmulti-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.\nInstead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire\ninference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,\nallowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also\nintroduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that\ncaptures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain\naccuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for\nfine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during\ninference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and\ninput data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration\noptimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for\neach modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping\nmechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early\npredictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public\nmultimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly\nreduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various\nsystem and data dynamics.",

    "summary": "Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and\nhigher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the\npotential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and\ncongestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.",

    "summary": "Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions\nthat explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better\nunderstand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition\nunder which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational\nmotif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of\ncontrolled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test\nwhether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of\nsubjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and\nbehavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are\nmechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated\nwith deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features\nsharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them\nminimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential\nstate converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any\ncontrol condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer\nintrospection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only\nindirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of\nconsciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and\nreproducible condition under which large language models generate structured\nfirst-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,\nand behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across\narchitectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for\nfurther investigation.",

    "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have\nsignificantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities by generating longer chains\nof thought, demonstrating outstanding performance across a variety of tasks.\nHowever, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in\nredundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high\ncomputational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking. Although\nnumerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking, they\noften rely on external interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework, Self-Braking Tuning (SBT), which tackles overthinking from the\nperspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process, thus\neliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms. We construct a set of\noverthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a\nsystematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately\nidentifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates\ntraining signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this\nfoundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive\nreasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that\nenables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an\nappropriate point.

We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free\nframework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the\nvariance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the\ngeneration's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to\nmitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments\ndemonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic\nadaptation.

    "title": "Learning Geometry: A Framework for Building Adaptive Manifold Models\n  through Metric Optimization",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond\ntraditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully\ndynamic \"meta-learners\" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and\ntopology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as\nscientific model discovery and robust representation learning.",

    "summary": "This position paper argues that the theoretical inconsistency often observed\namong Responsible AI (RAI) metrics, such as differing fairness definitions or\ntradeoffs between accuracy and privacy, should be embraced as a valuable\nfeature rather than a flaw to be eliminated. We contend that navigating these\ninconsistencies, by treating metrics as divergent objectives, yields three key\nbenefits: (1) Normative Pluralism: Maintaining a full suite of potentially\ncontradictory metrics ensures that the diverse moral stances and stakeholder\nvalues inherent in RAI are adequately represented. (2) Epistemological\nCompleteness: The use of multiple, sometimes conflicting, metrics allows for a\nmore comprehensive capture of multifaceted ethical concepts, thereby preserving\ngreater informational fidelity about these concepts than any single, simplified\ndefinition. (3) Implicit Regularization: Jointly optimizing for theoretically\nconflicting objectives discourages overfitting to one specific metric, steering\nmodels towards solutions with enhanced generalization and robustness under\nreal-world complexities. In contrast, efforts to enforce theoretical\nconsistency by simplifying or pruning metrics risk narrowing this value\ndiversity, losing conceptual depth, and degrading model performance. We\ntherefore advocate for a shift in RAI theory and practice: from getting trapped\nin inconsistency to characterizing acceptable inconsistency thresholds and\nelucidating the mechanisms that permit robust, approximated consistency in\npractice.",

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal\ndiscovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly\nprevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent\nof multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two\nprimary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal\ninteractions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2)\ninsufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data.\nTo address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for\nmultimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key\ncomponents: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine\nmultimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample\npairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal\nrelationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal\ncounterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by\nincorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.\nExtensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal\nrelationships among them from multimodal unstructured data.",

    "summary": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and\ntransferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's\nrobustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on\nout-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.",

To address this, we introduce PGED\n(Preference Graph Ensemble and Denoise), a novel approach that leverages\nmultiple model-based evaluators to construct preference graphs, and then\nensembles and denoises these graphs for acyclic, non-contradictory evaluation\nresults. We provide theoretical guarantees for our framework, demonstrating its\nefficacy in recovering the ground truth preference structure.

While recent\nstudies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such\ntasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative\ncapacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as\ninstructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired\nby the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general\nThink-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an\nembedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain\ncomplex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations\nconditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This\nexplicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex\nmultimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging\na powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the\nMMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house\ndatasets.

In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing\na holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which\nquantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.\nUsing this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they\nconsistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural\nlocalization across all six languages studied.

In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting\noverall traffic flow.

This paper introduces\nStuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that\nenables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or\npassenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on\nmodule that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control\nstack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it\ninterfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,\ninterpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that\ncan be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the\nBench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios.

In this work, we\npropose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a\ntool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.\nSpecifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given\nquery, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a\ntree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability\nto produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls.

    "summary": "We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating\nMicro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art\nsingle-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of\nionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new\npossibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We\npropose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to\nestimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely\nsparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly\nonboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of\nthe vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to\nmaximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the\nradiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.",

    "summary": "Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal\ncities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict\npotential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,\nalthough precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale\ncoastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising\nalternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data\nscarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently\nproposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,\nlightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict\ncoastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation\nscenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize\nacross diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct\nregions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the\nproposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the\nmean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly\n20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a\nscalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering\ndecision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the\ngrowing impacts of climate change.

Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on\nclean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy\ndata remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as\nastrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present\na fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation\nlearning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning.\nOur method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to\nconstruct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on\ndenoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2),\ncombined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to\ntheir denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize\nnoise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining,\nsimplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise\n($\\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by\n4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from\nnoise-aware pretraining.

In this paper, we document the phenomenon of\n\\textit{reward collapse}, an empirical observation where the prevailing\nranking-based approach results in an \\textit{identical} reward distribution\n\\textit{regardless} of the prompts during the terminal phase of training. This\noutcome is undesirable as open-ended prompts like ``write a short story about\nyour best friend'' should yield a continuous range of rewards for their\ncompletions, while specific prompts like ``what is the capital of New Zealand''\nshould generate either high or low rewards. Our theoretical investigation\nreveals that reward collapse is primarily due to the insufficiency of the\nranking-based objective function to incorporate prompt-related information\nduring optimization. This insight allows us to derive closed-form expressions\nfor the reward distribution associated with a set of utility functions in an\nasymptotic regime. To overcome reward collapse, we introduce a prompt-aware\noptimization scheme that provably admits a prompt-dependent reward distribution\nwithin the interpolating regime. Our experimental results suggest that our\nproposed prompt-aware utility functions significantly alleviate reward collapse\nduring the training of reward models.",

    "title": "Enhancing Reasoning Skills in Small Persian Medical Language Models Can\n  Outperform Large-Scale Data Training",
    "summary": "Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for\nspecialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in\nunderrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement\nLearning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to\nimprove the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To\nachieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering\ndataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer\npairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and\nstudent models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we\ncompiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.\nThis dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million\ntokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly\nenhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the\nresulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on\napproximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.\nThese results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused\ntraining approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited\ndata availability.",

    "title": "Value Drifts: Tracing Value Alignment During LLM Post-Training",
    "summary": "As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and\nmore confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their\ngeneral knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.\nTherefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a\ncrucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the\nalignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which\nmodels learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at\nwhich stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's\npost-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training\nalgorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts\nduring training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different\nsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization\ndatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a\nmodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these\nvalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preference\noptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when\npreference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into\nhow values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,\nas well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization\nto improve model alignment to human values.",

    "summary": "We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for\nthe first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across\nvarious scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement\nlearning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an\nexpressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a\nfiner-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited\nfinite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear\noutperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while\nreducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding\nthroughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be\na drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior\nperformance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output\nlengths.\n  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM\nimplementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model\ncheckpoints.",

This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative\nanalysis especially \\textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns\nthat the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill\nthis gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent\nrecipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison\nbetween RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,\npretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\\sim$150M\nto $\\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for\ninstruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling\nscaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall\nmore compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling\nand context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM\nachieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while\nenjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could\ninspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for\ndeveloping powerful and efficient LLMs.",

Whereas previous\nwork has focused on evidence citation with fixed levels of granularity (e.g.\nsentence, paragraph, document, etc.), we propose to extract unstructured (i.e.,\nspans of any length) evidence in order to acquire more relevant and consistent\nevidence than in the fixed granularity case. We show how existing systems\nstruggle to copy and properly cite unstructured evidence, which also tends to\nbe \"lost-in-the-middle\". To help models perform this task, we create the\nSummaries with Unstructured Evidence Text dataset (SUnsET), a synthetic dataset\ngenerated using a novel pipeline, which can be used as training supervision for\nunstructured evidence summarization. We demonstrate across 5 LLMs and 4\ndatasets spanning human written, synthetic, single, and multi-document settings\nthat LLMs adapted with SUnsET generate more relevant and factually consistent\nevidence with their summaries, extract evidence from more diverse locations in\ntheir context, and can generate more relevant and consistent summaries than\nbaselines with no fine-tuning and fixed granularity evidence.

Using MCC (95% CI) the\nideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3\nEnsemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522\n(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between\nTop-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).\n  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a\nmore consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective\nevaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.",

To address this gap, we\nempirically compare ten individual LLMs from five families, and three ensembles\nof these LLMs across three software engineering benchmarks covering code\ngeneration and program repair. We assess the complementarity between models and\nthe performance gap between the best individual model and the ensembles.

We find that the theoretical upperbound for an\nensemble's performance can be 83% above the best single model.

In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent\nframework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging\na diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a\nstructured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.\nDuring the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each\nembodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines\nan initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates\na plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed\noracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this\nexecution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using\nthe specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before\nre-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks\ndemonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms\nstate-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle\naccuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini.

Additionally, current benchmarks are often\nlimited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.\nThis issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address\nthis gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational\nbenchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.\nThe data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge\ndimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K\nentries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained\ncategories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and\n20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of\nquestion formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid\nfoundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.\nExtensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs\nreveal a clear performance gap.

While Large\nLanguage Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they\noften fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation\narises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic\ntranslation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative\nrefinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we\npropose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates\nsemantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This\nenables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its\nsemantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive\nrefinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce\nProspective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different\nrewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both\naccurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing\nsuperficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive\nexperiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm\nachieves an average improvement of 22.6 percentage points over the strongest\nbaselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce\nConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only\nvalidates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently\ndifficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.",

This paper studies the evaluation of LLM\nmeta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses.\nSpecifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation\nframework for benchmarking the existing lenses.

    "title": "Do LLMs Signal When They're Right? Evidence from Neuron Agreement",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via\nsample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground\ntruth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external\noutputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these\nsignals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze\ninternal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)\nexternal signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;\n(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than\nincorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct\nresponses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones\ndiverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding\n(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using\nactivation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on\ninternal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables\nearly correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports\naggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable\nanswers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where\nmajority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By\npruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with\nminimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide\nreliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.",

    "summary": "Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to\nidentify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats\nemerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly\nresolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself\nfaithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the\nsecret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or\nthe adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be\nprivate, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the\ndilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),\nenabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third\nparties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of\n`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints\nare built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and\nsummation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,\ncovering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and\nfour ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of\ncircumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public\nverifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without\ncompromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in\npractice.",

This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD\nbehavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on\ncross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability\nunder model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP\nand SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual\nQA.

    "summary": "We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs\nthrough competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of\ndiversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a \"sparta\ntribe\" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving\nas judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction\nand two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two\nresponses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted\nelo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose\nweight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become\npreference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,\nand all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.\nSPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative\nand collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines\nacross 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further\nanalysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen\ntasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce\nmore logical, direct and informative outputs.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for recommendation\nby framing item prediction as a token-by-token language generation task.\nHowever, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing\nlikelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks\ncrucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little\nto item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify\ntoken decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation\nas a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain\n(IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our\nempirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to\nhigh logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which\nmay impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an\nInformation Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that\nintegrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD\ndownweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize\ntokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood\nmaximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive\nexperiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that\nIGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains\non widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines.",

We further introduce the SDM\nestimator, based on a data-driven partitioning of the class-wise empirical CDFs\nvia the SDM activation, to control the class- and prediction-conditional\naccuracy among selective classifications.

    "summary": "The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge\nfrom text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to\nthe mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We\npropose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE\noutput and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a\ndocument set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the\ndatabase with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction.\nThis task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and\nadapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate\nthis new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as\ndata infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an\nLLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer\ncomponent that interacts with the database, the Planner component that\ngenerates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component\nthat provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments\nshow that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating\ndifferent code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight\ndifficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies\nand extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.\nSource code: https://github.com/yzjiao/Text2DB",

The\nsilver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on\nthe majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver\ndatasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,\nCause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive\ntexts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,\nRepetition and to cast Doubt.

    "summary": "While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning\nability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often\nbecomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common \"one problem, one\nsolution\" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer\nand can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we\npropose a \"one problem, multiple solutions\" (1PNS) training paradigm that\nexposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus\nincreases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring\nsemantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce\nReasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores\nLong Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate\nreasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and\nfine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields\nmore varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16\nover a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that\n1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS.

Proof planning, particularly in contexts requiring the validation\nof explanation accuracy, continues to present challenges. The recent\nadvancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant progress in\nnatural language proof planning, evolving from one-stage generators to more\ncomplex three-stage systems that include additional searchers or verifiers.\nWhile these assisted methods improve the quality of generated results, they\nalso introduce increased search efforts and computational costs. Furthermore,\nthe generative process itself remains underexplored. In this study, we propose\na stepwise decoding approach augmented by contrastive learning to address two\ncommon errors encountered during the LLM generator's decoding process. We\nfine-tune the language model using both vanilla and enhanced hard negatives to\nmitigate these decoding errors. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our strategy.

To address this gap, we introduce\nQCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum\nprogramming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers\ntwo key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator\nenvironment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of\ndomain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error\nclassification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it\nincorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming\ncontests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of\nLLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even\nadvanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting\nthe difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3\nreach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written\ncodes (39.98%).

Direct preference optimization\n(DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both\nexperimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal\nfor refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these\nshortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO\nobjectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages\nrefusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted\nunlearning of harmful knowledge.

This self-supervised procedure yields more accurate\nstate-value predictions, which in turn enable lightweight search algorithms to\nexpand fewer states while maintaining strong performance. Empirically,\nSTL-trained value models built on moderately sized (8B parameter) open-weight\nLLMs boost web agent success rates by 39%, achieving comparable performance\nwith proprietary models.

    "summary": "While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across many domains, it\nhas historically underperformed on tabular learning tasks, which remain\ndominated by gradient boosting decision trees. However, recent advancements are\npaving the way for Tabular Foundation Models, which can leverage real-world\nknowledge and generalize across diverse datasets, particularly when the data\ncontains free-text. Although incorporating language model capabilities into\ntabular tasks has been explored, most existing methods utilize static,\ntarget-agnostic textual representations, limiting their effectiveness. We\nintroduce TabSTAR: a Tabular Foundation Model with Semantically Target-Aware\nRepresentations. TabSTAR is designed to enable transfer learning on tabular\ndata with textual features, with an architecture free of dataset-specific\nparameters. It unfreezes a pretrained text encoder and takes as input target\ntokens, which provide the model with the context needed to learn task-specific\nembeddings. TabSTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance for both medium- and\nlarge-sized datasets across known benchmarks of classification tasks with text\nfeatures, and its pretraining phase exhibits scaling laws in the number of\ndatasets, offering a pathway for further performance improvements.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require\nmulti-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement\nLearning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely\nsampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to\noverfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address\nthis gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that\nreformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical \"actions\". SRL\ntrains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing\nto each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between\nthe model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a\nstep-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all\nrollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert\ndemonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging\nproblems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training\nwith SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.\nBeyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software\nengineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework\nfor reasoning-oriented LLMs.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such\nas chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads\nsuch as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding\nrely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input\nsequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only\nscenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance\nbottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In\nthis paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce\nsimilar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we\npropose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM\ninference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an\nattention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and\nsimilarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps\nduring inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of\nself-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of\n1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x\nattention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.",

In this paper, we hypothesize that\nsemantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.\nThrough a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral\ndomains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,\nparticularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT\ntools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can\namplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between\nsource and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation.

I compare my sentiment\nextraction approach to other commonly used methods for sentiment analysis:\n`bag-of-words' approaches, fine-tuned language models, and querying advanced\nchatbots. No other method can fully reproduce the results obtained by\nprompt-based sentiment extraction. Finally, I slightly modify the method to\nobtain `gendered' sentiment scores (as in Eberhardt et al., 2023).

In this work, we investigate\nthese assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse\nmultilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study\nchallenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find\nthat combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the\nin-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a\nsufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we\nobserve that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language\nthat serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits\nacross language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot\nlanguage from within a specific family does not consistently improve\nperformance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a\nsignificant \"curse of multilinguality\" as the number of training languages\nincreases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,\nwhen balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without\ncompromising performance, even in low-resource settings",

Finally, LSCD labels are derived by\ncomparing sense clusters over time. This modularity is reflected in most LSCD\ndatasets and models. It also leads to a large heterogeneity in modeling options\nand task definitions, which is exacerbated by a variety of dataset versions,\npreprocessing options and evaluation metrics. This heterogeneity makes it\ndifficult to evaluate models under comparable conditions, to choose optimal\nmodel combinations or to reproduce results. Hence, we provide a benchmark\nrepository standardizing LSCD evaluation.

    "title": "GradEscape: A Gradient-Based Evader Against AI-Generated Text Detectors",
    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce GradEscape, the first gradient-based evader\ndesigned to attack AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors. GradEscape overcomes the\nundifferentiable computation problem, caused by the discrete nature of text, by\nintroducing a novel approach to construct weighted embeddings for the detector\ninput. It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim\ndetectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To\naddress the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we\nintroduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to\ndetectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel\ntokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective\nevasion even in query-only access.\n  We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language\nmodels, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders.\nExperimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders\nin various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing\nonly 139M parameters. We have successfully applied GradEscape to two real-world\ncommercial AIGT detectors. Our analysis reveals that the primary vulnerability\nstems from disparity in text expression styles within the training data. We\nalso propose a potential defense strategy to mitigate the threat of AIGT\nevaders. We open-source our GradEscape for developing more robust AIGT\ndetectors.",

    "summary": "The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised\nconcerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering.\nWhile various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these\nrisks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as\nparaphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against\nsuch basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a\ntraining-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text\nto evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf\ninstruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance\nof an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically\noptimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is\nboth broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection\nsystems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,\nironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%\non RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by\nOpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on\nFast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural\nnetwork-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves\nan average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of\nOpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and\nattack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection\nrates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup\nhighlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the\nlight of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.",

Scalable Oversight aims to ensure AI\nsystems remain truthful even when their capabilities exceed those of their\nevaluators. Yet when humans serve as evaluators, their own beliefs and biases\ncan impair judgment. We study whether AI debate can guide biased judges toward\nthe truth by having two AI systems debate opposing sides of controversial\nfactuality claims on COVID-19 and climate change where people hold strong prior\nbeliefs. We conduct two studies. Study I recruits human judges with either\nmainstream or skeptical beliefs who evaluate claims through two protocols:\ndebate (interaction with two AI advisors arguing opposing sides) or consultancy\n(interaction with a single AI advisor). Study II uses AI judges with and\nwithout human-like personas to evaluate the same protocols. In Study I, debate\nconsistently improves human judgment accuracy and confidence calibration,\noutperforming consultancy by 4-10% across COVID-19 and climate change claims.\nThe improvement is most significant for judges with mainstream beliefs (up to\n+15.2% accuracy on COVID-19 claims), though debate also helps skeptical judges\nwho initially misjudge claims move toward accurate views (+4.7% accuracy). In\nStudy II, AI judges with human-like personas achieve even higher accuracy\n(78.5%) than human judges (70.1%) and default AI judges without personas\n(69.8%), suggesting their potential for supervising frontier AI models.

Existing video-to-4D methods\ntypically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive\nand brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches\nmitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera\ntrajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby\ndepicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this\ntrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene\ndynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a\npose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory\nprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby\nseparating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video\ninpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising\nrealistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing\nregions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D\nannotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal\nautoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and\nextends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at\nbounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation\nand sparse reconstruction benchmarks.

First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed\nfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and\ngeneralization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human\nevaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.",

    "summary": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

    "summary": "Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and\nthe exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models\n(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract\nfine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also\nhinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel \"ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)\" to provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting\ntabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various\nattributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON\ntemplate to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically\ntailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference\nworkflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and\ncompare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on\nseveral recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,\nweaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These\nfindings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart\nunderstanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened\nin current models.",

    "summary": "Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream\nObject-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into\nrespective slot vectors, by \\textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query\nvectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such\naggregation is \\textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries\ncold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's\nslots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific\ncues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,\nnon-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms\ndifferent from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the\nfirst time with our \\textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image\nor video's first frame, we \\textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich\ninformation of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)\nTo smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \\textit{differentiate} the\nhomogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and\nsingle iterations respectively.

    "summary": "Recent work has shown that the generalization ability of image diffusion\nmodels arises from the locality properties of the trained neural network. In\nparticular, when denoising a particular pixel, the model relies on a limited\nneighborhood of the input image around that pixel, which, according to the\nprevious work, is tightly related to the ability of these models to produce\nnovel images. Since locality is central to generalization, it is crucial to\nunderstand why diffusion models learn local behavior in the first place, as\nwell as the factors that govern the properties of locality patterns. In this\nwork, we present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as\na statistical property of the image dataset and is not due to the inductive\nbias of convolutional neural networks, as suggested in previous work.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser\nexhibits similar locality properties to deep neural denoisers. We show, both\ntheoretically and experimentally, that this locality arises directly from pixel\ncorrelations present in the image datasets. Moreover, locality patterns are\ndrastically different on specialized datasets, approximating principal\ncomponents of the data's covariance. We use these insights to craft an\nanalytical denoiser that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion\nmodel than prior expert-crafted alternatives. Our key takeaway is that while\nneural network architectures influence generation quality, their primary role\nis to capture locality patterns inherent in the data.",

    "summary": "Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack\nmethods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\\ell_{p}$-norm\nperturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual\ncapabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward\ngenerating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based\napproaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to\ninstability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed\nfor UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation\ninjection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on\ndiffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable\nadversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution\ntowards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map\nto inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated\nsamples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of\nnatural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but\nalso retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA\ndatasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in\nboth black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv\nachieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality, while\nmaintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between\ndenoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even\nunder defensive measures.",

To mitigate this, various unsupervised domain\nadaptation based methods such as UDAGAN have been proposed, which reduce the\nneed for labels by requiring only one (source) stain to be labelled.\nNonetheless, obtaining source stain labels can still be challenging. This\narticle shows that through self-supervised pre-training -- including SimCLR,\nBYOL, and a novel approach, HR-CS-CO -- the performance of these segmentation\nmethods (UNet, and UDAGAN) can be retained even with 95% fewer labels. Notably,\nwith self-supervised pre-training and using only 5% labels, the performance\ndrops are minimal: 5.9% for UNet and 6.2% for UDAGAN, averaged over all stains,\ncompared to their respective fully supervised counterparts (without\npre-training, using 100% labels). Furthermore, these findings are shown to\ngeneralise beyond their training distribution to public benchmark datasets.\nImplementations and pre-trained models are publicly available\n\\href{https://github.com/zeeshannisar/resource-effecient-multi-stain-kidney-glomeruli-segmentation.git}{online}.",

    "summary": "Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained\nvision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in robotic\nmanipulation. However, these models remain constrained by the single-frame\nimage paradigm and fail to fully leverage the temporal information offered by\nmulti-frame histories, as directly feeding multiple frames into VLM backbones\nincurs substantial computational overhead and inference latency. We propose\nCronusVLA, a unified framework that extends single-frame VLA models to the\nmulti-frame paradigm. CronusVLA follows a two-stage process: (1) Single-frame\npretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive prediction of\naction tokens, establishing an effective embodied vision-language foundation;\n(2) Multi-frame post-training, which adapts the prediction of the\nvision-language backbone from discrete tokens to learnable features, and\naggregates historical information via feature chunking. CronusVLA effectively\naddresses the existing challenges of multi-frame modeling while enhancing\nperformance and observational robustness. To evaluate the robustness under\ntemporal and spatial disturbances, we introduce SimplerEnv-OR, a novel\nbenchmark featuring 24 types of observational disturbances and 120 severity\nlevels. Experiments across three embodiments in simulated and real-world\nenvironments demonstrate that CronusVLA achieves leading performance and\nsuperior robustness, with a 70.9% success rate on SimplerEnv, a 26.8%\nimprovement over OpenVLA on LIBERO, and the highest robustness score on\nSimplerEnv-OR. These results highlight the potential of efficient multi-frame\nadaptation in VLA models for more powerful and robust real-world deployment.",

    "summary": "Assessing the severity of artifacts in pediatric brain Magnetic Resonance\nImaging (MRI) is critical for diagnostic accuracy, especially in low-field\nsystems where the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced. Manual quality assessment\nis time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated\nsolutions.

While optical flow, a computer\nvision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,\nhas advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical\nproblems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical\nflow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,\nwhich limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based\napproaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in\ncomputer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We\npresent the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models\non RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and\nFl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer\naccuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the\nspatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the\nArctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing\nconsistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical\nflow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy\ncompared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote\nsensing.

While recent breakthroughs in\nComputer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable\nprogress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains\nfragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative\nintelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking\nanalysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI\nrather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically\nreviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,\nand Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their\ncapabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their\npotential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception\nframeworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that\nmoves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,\nand cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a\ncross-analysis of data structures and characteristics.

Although existing deepfake detection\nmodels demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods\nonly provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability.\nRecent studies have attempted to enhance the interpretability of classification\nresults by providing spatial manipulation masks or temporal forgery segments.\nHowever, due to the limitations of forgery datasets, the practical\neffectiveness of these methods remains suboptimal. The primary reason lies in\nthe fact that most existing deepfake datasets contain only binary labels, with\nlimited variety in forgery scenarios, insufficient diversity in deepfake types,\nand relatively small data scales, making them inadequate for complex real-world\nscenarios.To address this predicament, we construct a novel large-scale\ndeepfake detection and localization (\\textbf{DDL}) dataset containing over\n$\\textbf{1.4M+}$ forged samples and encompassing up to $\\textbf{80}$ distinct\ndeepfake methods.

    "summary": "Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in\nhuman-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos\nwith motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit\nmodeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit\narticulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial\nmovements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel\nframework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.\nHM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and\nexplicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically\ndefined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize\nphoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement\nModule (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while\npredicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate\nidentity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject\ngeneralization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This\nmodule dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing\nidentity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip\nsynchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head\nsynthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over\nstate-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,\ntheir generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain\nscenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to\nlarge distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation\nmechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or\nbespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across\ndiverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for\ncross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while\nrequiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to\ndecouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight\nmodules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual\nadapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a\nVisual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically\ninjected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone\nmodel. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without\nretraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on\nMedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH\nprovides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling\npractical deployment across diverse application domains.",

    "summary": "Olive tree biovolume estimation is a key task in precision agriculture,\nsupporting yield prediction and resource management, especially in\nMediterranean regions severely impacted by climate-induced stress. This study\npresents a comparative analysis of three deep learning models U-Net,\nYOLOv11m-seg, and Mask RCNN for segmenting olive tree crowns and their shadows\nin ultra-high resolution UAV imagery. The UAV dataset, acquired over\nVicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks.

In testing,\nMask R-CNN achieved the best overall accuracy (F1 = 0.86; mIoU = 0.72), while\nYOLOv11m-seg provided the fastest throughput (0.12 second per image). The\nestimated biovolumes spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters,\nreflecting clear structural differences among trees. These results indicate\nMask R-CNN is preferable when biovolume accuracy is paramount, whereas\nYOLOv11m-seg suits large-area deployments where speed is critical; U-Net\nremains a lightweight, high-sensitivity option.

    "summary": "Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),\nplays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical\napplications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,\nthe global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect\nthe high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine\nbones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,\nwhich deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network\n(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a\nscale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional\nlong-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the\nconsistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic\nlevel affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform\nsemantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a\nTransformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a\nfeature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior\nsegmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but\nits promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically\nhindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This\npaper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,\nsystematically overcomes these critical hurdles.

Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously\ndelivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its\ncore diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its\noverall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive.

To address these challenges, we propose the Reconfigurable\nContinuum Gaussian Stream, dubbed ReCon-GS, a novel storage-aware framework\nthat enables high fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time\nrendering. Specifically, we dynamically allocate multi-level Anchor Gaussians\nin a density-adaptive fashion to capture inter-frame geometric deformations,\nthereby decomposing scene motion into compact coarse-to-fine representations.\nThen, we design a dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration strategy that preserves\nlocalized motion expressiveness through on-demand anchor re-hierarchization,\nwhile ensuring temporal consistency through intra-hierarchical deformation\ninheritance that confines transformation priors to their respective hierarchy\nlevels. Furthermore, we introduce a storage-aware optimization mechanism that\nflexibly adjusts the density of Anchor Gaussians at different hierarchy levels,\nenabling a controllable trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and memory\nusage. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that,\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods, ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by\napproximately 15% and achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced\nrobustness and stability.

Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability\nof pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous\nregions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.\nHowever, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can\nonly pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to\nidentify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment\nbetween image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving\nsub-optimal localization performance.

    "summary": "Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for\nadapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on\nlabeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular\ndistance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate\naverage calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through\nextensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,\nour approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural\ndistribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide\nextensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding\nof A-TPT.

    "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models can generate realistic images based on textual\ninputs, enabling users to convey their opinions visually through language.\nMeanwhile, within language, emotion plays a crucial role in expressing personal\nopinions in our daily lives and the inclusion of maliciously negative content\ncan lead users astray, exacerbating negative emotions. Recognizing the success\nof diffusion models and the significance of emotion, we investigate a\npreviously overlooked risk associated with text-to-image diffusion models, that\nis, utilizing emotion in the input texts to introduce negative content and\nprovoke unfavorable emotions in users. Specifically, we identify a new backdoor\nattack, i.e., emotion-aware backdoor attack (EmoAttack), which introduces\nmalicious negative content triggered by emotional texts during image\ngeneration. We formulate such an attack as a diffusion personalization problem\nto avoid extensive model retraining and propose the EmoBooth. Unlike existing\npersonalization methods, our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained diffusion model\nby establishing a mapping between a cluster of emotional words and a given\nreference image containing malicious negative content. To validate the\neffectiveness of our method, we built a dataset and conducted extensive\nanalysis and discussion about its effectiveness. Given consumers' widespread\nuse of diffusion models, uncovering this threat is critical for society.",

    "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, in which\nDNNs are misled to false outputs due to inputs containing imperceptible\nperturbations. Adversarial training, a reliable and effective method of\ndefense, may significantly reduce the vulnerability of neural networks and\nbecomes the de facto standard for robust learning. While many recent works\npractice the data-centric philosophy, such as how to generate better\nadversarial examples or use generative models to produce additional training\ndata, we look back to the models themselves and revisit the adversarial\nrobustness from the perspective of deep feature distribution as an insightful\ncomplementarity. In this paper, we propose \\textit{Branch Orthogonality\nadveRsarial Training} (BORT) to obtain state-of-the-art performance with solely\nthe original dataset for adversarial training. To practice our design idea of\nintegrating multiple orthogonal solution spaces, we leverage a simple and\nstraightforward multi-branch neural network that eclipses adversarial attacks\nwith no increase in inference time. We heuristically propose a corresponding\nloss function, branch-orthogonal loss, to make each solution space of the\nmulti-branch model orthogonal. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100\nand SVHN against $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm-bounded perturbations of size $\\epsilon =\n8/255$, respectively.

    "summary": "Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) infers emotions from the\ntemporal evolution of expressions, unlike static facial expression recognition\n(SFER), which relies solely on a single snapshot. This temporal analysis\nprovides richer information and promises greater recognition capability.\nHowever, current DFER methods often exhibit unsatisfied performance largely due\nto fewer training samples compared to SFER. Given the inherent correlation\nbetween static and dynamic expressions, we hypothesize that leveraging the\nabundant SFER data can enhance DFER. To this end, we propose Static-for-Dynamic\n(S4D), a unified dual-modal learning framework that integrates SFER data as a\ncomplementary resource for DFER. Specifically, S4D employs dual-modal\nself-supervised pre-training on facial images and videos using a shared Vision\nTransformer (ViT) encoder-decoder architecture, yielding improved\nspatiotemporal representations. The pre-trained encoder is then fine-tuned on\nstatic and dynamic expression datasets in a multi-task learning setup to\nfacilitate emotional information interaction. Unfortunately, vanilla multi-task\nlearning in our study results in negative transfer. To address this, we propose\nan innovative Mixture of Adapter Experts (MoAE) module that facilitates\ntask-specific knowledge acquisition while effectively extracting shared\nknowledge from both static and dynamic expression data.

Previous works focus on\ndesigning discriminative models to maintain the identity consistency despite\ndrastic changes in camera viewpoints.

To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel generative framework named SD-ReID for AG-ReID, which leverages\ngenerative models to mimic the feature distribution of different views while\nextracting robust identity representations.

Furthermore, we introduce the View-Refined Decoder\n(VRD) to bridge the gap between instance-level and global-level features.\nFinally, both person representations and all-view features are employed to\nretrieve target persons.

To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early\ndetection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently\nestablished based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer\n(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of\nexisting methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One\npotential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of\nbackbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them\n(\\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global\nfeature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to\neffectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the\ntheory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm\ntransforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via\na set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the\naggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively\ntune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the\nperformance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly\navailable DR grading datasets.

    "summary": "Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in\noptimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with\ntask-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on\nimportance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative\ngradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the\nimportance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs\nsubstantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution\nprevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing\nthe mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a\nresult, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization\nstage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as\nimage quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making\nthe learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we\nintroduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO\nframeworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a\nbalanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping\nproperly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a\ngradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,\npreventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these\ndesigns act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and\nsubstantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL\nregularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,\nSD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard\nsignificantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving\ngeneration quality.",

    "summary": "Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented\nflexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains\nchallenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent\nconstraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their\nreal-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework\nintegrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our\nbenchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and\n$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to\n$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity\nsimulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital\ndynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are\nprovided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first\nlarge-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.\nBuilding upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based\nscheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A\ndedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and\noperational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative\nlearning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution\nfor AEOS constellation scheduling.

    "summary": "Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to its unique\ncharacteristics (e.g., small, dim, shapeless and changeable). Recently\npublished CNN-based methods have achieved promising performance with heavy\nfeature extraction and fusion modules. To achieve efficient and effective\ndetection, we propose a recurrent reusable-convolution attention network\n(RRCA-Net) for infrared small target detection. Specifically, RRCA-Net\nincorporates reusable-convolution block (RuCB) in a recurrent manner without\nintroducing extra parameters. With the help of the repetitive iteration in\nRuCB, the high-level information of small targets in the deep layers can be\nwell maintained and further refined. Then, a dual interactive attention\naggregation module (DIAAM) is proposed to promote the mutual enhancement and\nfusion of refined information. In this way, RRCA-Net can both achieve\nhigh-level feature refinement and enhance the correlation of contextual\ninformation between adjacent layers. Moreover, to achieve steady convergence,\nwe design a target characteristic inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) by\nintegrating physical and mathematical constraints. Experimental results on\nthree benchmark datasets (e.g. NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) demonstrate\nthat our RRCA-Net can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art\nmethods while maintaining a small number of parameters, and act as a plug and\nplay module to introduce consistent performance improvement for several popular\nIRSTD methods.",

    "summary": "Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of\nbalancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images\nby learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain\nlimited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection\nfurther affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex\nscenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion\nunder the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and\nvisible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the\nquantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,\nwhich leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational\nbottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and\ninformation decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal\ninformation, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural\ndetails. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion\nmodel is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical\nguidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at\ndifferent stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the\nintrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nfusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple\ndatasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics.

In this paper, we reveal that CLIP's vulnerabilities primarily stem\nfrom its tendency to encode features beyond in-dataset predictive patterns,\ncompromising its visual feature resistivity to input perturbations. This makes\nits encoded features highly susceptible to being reshaped by backdoor triggers.\nTo address this challenge, we propose Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning (RVPT), a\nnovel defense approach that employs deep visual prompt tuning with a specially\ndesigned feature-repelling loss. Specifically, RVPT adversarially repels the\nencoded features from deeper layers while optimizing the standard cross-entropy\nloss, ensuring that only predictive features in downstream tasks are encoded,\nthereby enhancing CLIP's visual feature resistivity against input perturbations\nand mitigating its susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Unlike existing\nmultimodal backdoor defense methods that typically require the availability of\npoisoned data or involve fine-tuning the entire model, RVPT leverages few-shot\ndownstream clean samples and only tunes a small number of parameters. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that RVPT tunes only 0.27\\% of the parameters in CLIP, yet\nit significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods, reducing the\nattack success rate from 89.70\\% to 2.76\\% against the most advanced multimodal\nattacks on ImageNet and effectively generalizes its defensive capabilities\nacross multiple datasets.",

    "summary": "Diffusion models have demonstrated promising performance in real-world video\nsuper-resolution (VSR). However, the dozens of sampling steps they require,\nmake inference extremely slow. Sampling acceleration techniques, particularly\nsingle-step, provide a potential solution. Nonetheless, achieving one step in\nVSR remains challenging, due to the high training overhead on video data and\nstringent fidelity demands. To tackle the above issues, we propose DOVE, an\nefficient one-step diffusion model for real-world VSR. DOVE is obtained by\nfine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model (i.e., CogVideoX). To\neffectively train DOVE, we introduce the latent-pixel training strategy. The\nstrategy employs a two-stage scheme to gradually adapt the model to the video\nsuper-resolution task. Meanwhile, we design a video processing pipeline to\nconstruct a high-quality dataset tailored for VSR, termed HQ-VSR. Fine-tuning\non this dataset further enhances the restoration capability of DOVE. Extensive\nexperiments show that DOVE exhibits comparable or superior performance to\nmulti-step diffusion-based VSR methods. It also offers outstanding inference\nefficiency, achieving up to a 28$\\times$ speed-up over existing methods such as\nMGLD-VSR. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/DOVE.",

Researchers have investigated various\nmethods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including\nblur kernels and optical flow.

    "summary": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to detect anomalies that deviate from what\nis expected. In open-world scenarios, the expected events may change as\nrequirements change. For example, not wearing a mask may be considered abnormal\nduring a flu outbreak but normal otherwise. However, existing methods assume\nthat the definition of anomalies is invariable, and thus are not applicable to\nthe open world. To address this, we propose a novel open-world VAD paradigm\nwith variable definitions, allowing guided detection through user-provided\nnatural language at inference time. This paradigm necessitates establishing a\nrobust mapping from video and textual definition to anomaly scores. Therefore,\nwe propose LaGoVAD (Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detector), a model\nthat dynamically adapts anomaly definitions under weak supervision with two\nregularization strategies: diversifying the relative durations of anomalies via\ndynamic video synthesis, and enhancing feature robustness through contrastive\nlearning with negative mining. Training such adaptable models requires diverse\nanomaly definitions, but existing datasets typically provide labels without\nsemantic descriptions. To bridge this gap, we collect PreVAD (Pre-training\nVideo Anomaly Dataset), the largest and most diverse video anomaly dataset to\ndate, featuring 35,279 annotated videos with multi-level category labels and\ndescriptions that explicitly define anomalies. Zero-shot experiments on seven\ndatasets demonstrate LaGoVAD's SOTA performance. Our dataset and code will be\nreleased at https://github.com/Kamino666/LaGoVAD-PreVAD.",

    "summary": "Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical\nlocation and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the\nmost common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,\nrickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto\n(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of\nauto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from\naccessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite\ndifficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially\nnon-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This\npaper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect\nauto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object\ndetection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of\n1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions.

    "summary": "In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing\nmethodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test\ndomain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key\nchallenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are\nhighly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate\nstatistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained\nby the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time\nstatistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit\nthe effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under\nsignificant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on\nthe concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of\nnormalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core\nparameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the\npre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting\nduring online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate\nthat our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain\nshift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to\nforgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly\nintegrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent\nperformance improvements across various architectures.

In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that\ncombines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding\nbox layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that\nimplicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little\ngeometric detail.

Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,\neach part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,\nenabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a\ncenter-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when\nexchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby\nmaintaining global coherence.

Despite progress, three key limitations\npersist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part\ngeometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects\npart independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)\nGlobal conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by\nhuman 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework\nthat decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part\ngeneration. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding\ncomplexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship\nmodeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual\nguidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part\nlatent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model\npriors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D\npart dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and\nhuman-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior\ncapabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene\ncomposition with unprecedented controllability.",

    "summary": "Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose\nestimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational\nbottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a\nunified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses\nwithout requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D\nGaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization\nstrategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity\nand pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization\ninto two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via\ndifferentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses\nusing a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and\nphotometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection\nerrors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations\nand sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive\nevaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly\noutperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also\nsurpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.",

    "summary": "As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves\nthe cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,\ncurrent OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS\ninvolves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,\nand (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a\ncritical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,\ncompiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we\npresent OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured\nmanagement and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly\nintegrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models\n(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we\nconstruct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,\nwhich is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,\ncleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M\nsingle-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent\nleverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in\nretrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior\nperformance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,\nsurpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,\nGPT-4o).

    "summary": "Pre-trained stable diffusion models (SD) have shown great advances in visual\ncorrespondence. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs) for accurate dense correspondence. Distinct from SD, DiTs\nexhibit a critical phenomenon in which very few feature activations exhibit\nsignificantly larger values than others, known as \\textit{massive activations},\nleading to uninformative representations and significant performance\ndegradation for DiTs. The massive activations consistently concentrate at very\nfew fixed dimensions across all image patch tokens, holding little local\ninformation. We trace these dimension-concentrated massive activations and find\nthat such concentration can be effectively localized by the zero-initialized\nAdaptive Layer Norm (AdaLN-zero). Building on these findings, we propose\nDiffusion Transformer Feature (DiTF), a training-free framework designed to\nextract semantic-discriminative features from DiTs. Specifically, DiTF employs\nAdaLN to adaptively localize and normalize massive activations with\nchannel-wise modulation. In addition, we develop a channel discard strategy to\nfurther eliminate the negative impacts from massive activations. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our DiTF outperforms both DINO and SD-based models and\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art performance for DiTs in different visual\ncorrespondence tasks (\\eg, with +9.4\\% on Spair-71k and +4.4\\% on AP-10K-C.S.).",

By exploiting intermediate\nfeatures in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial\nperturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box\ntransferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in\nprevious work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised\nlearning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether\nexploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve\nadversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual\nself-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural\nfeatures from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked\nimage modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We\ndesign a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to\ncreate black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by\nexploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.\nOur findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature\ntendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial\ngeneralizability.

    "summary": "Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes\nof permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as\nanti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the\ndegenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision\nloss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD\nor AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to\nreduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches,\ndeep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and\nGradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in\ndistinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI\ndriven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists\nregarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works\nmostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying\ncausal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific\nfactors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a\nnovel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified\nCausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT\nimages. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal\ninference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major\nrisk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent\ncausal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through\nGCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD\ncausal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for\nvarious tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.",

    "title": "Dynamic Traceback Learning for Medical Report Generation",
    "summary": "Automated medical report generation has demonstrated the potential to\nsignificantly reduce the workload associated with time-consuming medical\nreporting. Recent generative representation learning methods have shown promise\nin integrating vision and language modalities for medical report generation.\nHowever, when trained end-to-end and applied directly to medical image-to-text\ngeneration, they face two significant challenges: i) difficulty in accurately\ncapturing subtle yet crucial pathological details, and ii) reliance on both\nvisual and textual inputs during inference, leading to performance degradation\nin zero-shot inference when only images are available. To address these\nchallenges, this study proposes a novel multimodal dynamic traceback learning\nframework (DTrace). Specifically, we introduce a traceback mechanism to\nsupervise the semantic validity of generated content and a dynamic learning\nstrategy to adapt to various proportions of image and text input, enabling text\ngeneration without strong reliance on the input from both modalities during\ninference. The learning of cross-modal knowledge is enhanced by supervising the\nmodel to recover masked semantic information from a complementary counterpart.\nExtensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, IU-Xray and\nMIMIC-CXR, demonstrate that the proposed DTrace framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods for medical report generation.",

    "summary": "We consider the problem of text-to-video generation tasks with precise\ncontrol for various applications such as camera movement control and\nvideo-to-video editing. Most methods tacking this problem rely on providing\nuser-defined controls, such as binary masks or camera movement embeddings. In\nour approach we propose OnlyFlow, an approach leveraging the optical flow\nfirstly extracted from an input video to condition the motion of generated\nvideos. Using a text prompt and an input video, OnlyFlow allows the user to\ngenerate videos that respect the motion of the input video as well as the text\nprompt. This is implemented through an optical flow estimation model applied on\nthe input video, which is then fed to a trainable optical flow encoder. The\noutput feature maps are then injected into the text-to-video backbone model. We\nperform quantitative, qualitative and user preference studies to show that\nOnlyFlow positively compares to state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of\ntasks, even though OnlyFlow was not specifically trained for such tasks.\nOnlyFlow thus constitutes a versatile, lightweight yet efficient method for\ncontrolling motion in text-to-video generation.

    "summary": "Prototype Memory is a powerful model for face representation learning. It\nenables training face recognition models on datasets of any size by generating\nprototypes (classifier weights) on the fly and efficiently utilizing them.\nPrototype Memory demonstrated strong results in many face recognition\nbenchmarks. However, the algorithm of prototype generation, used in it, is\nprone to the problems of imperfectly calculated prototypes in case of\nlow-quality or poorly recognizable faces in the images, selected for the\nprototype creation. All images of the same person presented in the mini-batch\nare used with equal weights, and the resulting averaged prototype can be\ncontaminated by imperfect embeddings of low-quality face images. This may lead\nto misleading training signals and degrade the performance of the trained\nmodels. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective way to improve\nPrototype Memory with quality-aware prototype generation. Quality-Aware\nPrototype Memory uses different weights for images of different quality in the\nprocess of prototype generation. With this improvement, prototypes receive more\ninformative signals from high-quality images and are less affected by\nlow-quality ones.

    "summary": "Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related\nfatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as\nclosed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,\nseparate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and\nrequire dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting\nadaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these\nchallenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic\nincident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial\nperspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better\nlow-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep\nlearning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident\ndetection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected\ndataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity\nassessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a\nweb-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS\ndetected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local\ntransportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion\npropagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and\nenable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.\nCrucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on\nfrequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and\ncost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.\nThis study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated\nreal-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for\nthe operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation\nmanagement.",

    "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image\nretrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications\nremains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot\naction. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind.\nThat is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental\nrepresentations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task\nof Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored\nsetting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through\nmulti-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful\ninteractive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with\nclear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or\nabstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective\nfor users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative\nmulti-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to\nexplicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic\nvisual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to\nrefine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully\nautomated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.\nExperimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing\ninteractive methods in the MIR scenario.

Training was configured to minimize\noverfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,\nand a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was\napplied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve\ngeneralization while adapting to annotator-specific styles.

    "summary": "Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings\nprovides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress\nenabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the\nactual seen images. We present \"Brain-IT\", a brain-inspired approach that\naddresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),\nallowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar\nbrain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as\nbuilding blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All\nmodel components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient\ntraining with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT\npredicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level\nsemantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic\ncontent of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to\ninitialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.\nBIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to\nlocalized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image\nreconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and\nsurpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective\nmetrics.

    "summary": "Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due\nto their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their\nstrong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing\ntasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the\nlatent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in\noutputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have\nattempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based\napproaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal\nediting quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output.

    "summary": "Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains\nchallenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and\nsignificant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their\neffectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them\nimpractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA\n(Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient\nsemantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through\ncompositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional\nconvolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a\nparameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging\nlow-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized\nfeature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect\nanalysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature\nrepresentation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ninfrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive\nor superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while\nusing significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction).\nOperating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for\nreal-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection\nsystems without compromising accuracy.

We propose Neural Atlas Graphs (NAGs), a\nhybrid high-resolution scene representation, where every graph node is a\nview-dependent neural atlas, facilitating both 2D appearance editing and 3D\nordering and positioning of scene elements.

Our framework unifies\nRiesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning, covariate balancing,\ntargeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and density-ratio estimation. In\nmany problems involving causal effects or structural models, the parameters of\ninterest depend on regression functions. Plugging regression functions\nestimated by machine learning methods into the identifying equations can yield\npoor performance because of first-stage bias.

In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed\nPSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the\nmathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate\nsolutions despite significantly smaller training data sets.

As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in\nseveral respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common\nconditions.

    "summary": "State-of-the-art embeddings often capture distinct yet complementary\ndiscriminative features: For instance, one image embedding model may excel at\ndistinguishing fine-grained textures, while another focuses on object-level\nstructure. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled approach to\nfuse such complementary representations through kernel multiplication.\nMultiplying the kernel similarity functions of two embeddings allows their\ndiscriminative structures to interact, producing a fused representation whose\nkernel encodes the union of the clusters identified by each parent embedding.\nThis formulation also provides a natural way to construct joint kernels for\npaired multi-modal data (e.g., image-text tuples), where the product of\nmodality-specific kernels inherits structure from both domains. We highlight\nthat this kernel product is mathematically realized via the Kronecker product\nof the embedding feature maps, yielding our proposed KrossFuse framework for\nembedding fusion. To address the computational cost of the resulting\nhigh-dimensional Kronecker space, we further develop RP-KrossFuse, a scalable\nvariant that leverages random projections for efficient approximation. As a key\napplication, we use this framework to bridge the performance gap between\ncross-modal embeddings (e.g., CLIP, BLIP) and unimodal experts (e.g., DINOv2,\nE5). Experiments show that RP-KrossFuse effectively integrates these models,\nenhancing modality-specific performance while preserving cross-modal alignment.\nThe project code is available at https://github.com/yokiwuuu/KrossFuse.",

This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary\nexpert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral\nframework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing\nexpert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both\ntwo-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively\nquery only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active\nlearning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and\nthe core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost\nand predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our\nalgorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.\nEmpirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially\nreduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating\nthe practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.",

Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task.

Such models rely\non key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful\nlearning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior.

However, many real-world\nsystems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit\nnon-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this\npaper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is\ncapable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in\nstark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is\nconstructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.\nWe showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single\ncells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate\nvelocities.

Therefore, the only scalable and viable\nsolution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected\nfrom diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,\nbased on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to\nrun. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to\ntime series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based\napproaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper\nstudies the performance of time series classification methods used as model\nselection for anomaly detection.

    "summary": "Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial\ntasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,\nBO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.\nRecent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the\nrelationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we\ndevelop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a\nsystematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this\nframework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either\nrelated or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in\nour experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results\npresented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially\nwhen the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In\ncontrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,\nwe show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to\nachieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow\nor complex algorithms.",

    "summary": "Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for\nlocalizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it\nis computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a\nfaster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced\nreliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce\nRelevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution\npatching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance\nPropagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the\nlayers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local\npropagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or\nimproved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only\ntwo forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency\nwhile improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and\ntasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than\nstandard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and\nMLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for\nMLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation\nof 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by\nRelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits\nidentified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves\ncomparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with\nIG.",

Generative models\nprovide continuous latent \"maps\" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore\ndecoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering\nexploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based\nremedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in\npractice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware\nframework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a\nUnion of $\\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\\mathbb{M}^{\\kappa}$, a family\nof decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring\ncomputational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order\nRiemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent\nsecond-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation\nEnumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete\namino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian\nOptimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.\nFinally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which\ninterpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,\nbiasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro\nvalidation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel\nseeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active\npeptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial\nstrains.

To address this issue, several classical\nstatistical learning approaches have been repurposed for scalable\nuncertainty-aware LoRA fine-tuning.

To address this\nlimitation, we propose Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation (C-LoRA) as a novel\nuncertainty-aware and parameter efficient fine-tuning approach, by developing\nnew lightweight LoRA modules contextualized to each input data sample to\ndynamically adapt uncertainty estimates. Incorporating data-driven contexts\ninto the parameter posteriors, C-LoRA mitigates overfitting, achieves\nwell-calibrated uncertainties, and yields robust predictions.

C-LoRA sets a new standard for robust,\nuncertainty-aware LLM fine-tuning in few-shot regimes.

    "summary": "This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is\nbecoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often\nignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.\nTo overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the\nparameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the\nminimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based\noptimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced\nnonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than\nor comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,\nwhile maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via\ncontrol points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that\ncombines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.\nProspects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian\ndistributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and\nadapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating\nsurfaces and more complex structures.",

Existing approaches for\ndifferentiating the solution of a QP with respect to its defining parameters\noften rely on specific integrated solvers.

A key\ninsight we leverage to achieve modularity is that, once the active set of\ninequality constraints is known, both the solution and its derivative can be\nexpressed using simplified linear systems that share the same matrix. This\nformulation fully decouples the computation of the QP solution from its\ndifferentiation. Building on this result, we provide a minimal-overhead,\nopen-source implementation ( https://github.com/cwmagoon/dQP ) that seamlessly\nintegrates with over 15 state-of-the-art solvers.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for decision-making in\nuncertain environments, but it often requires large amounts of data to learn an\noptimal policy.

We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and\nlower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of\nthe agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the\nQ-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring\npolicies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of\nthe model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of\nexploring policies to the optimal policy.

Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of\npredicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from\ntube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the\nstaged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,\npotentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.",

Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by\nincorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this\nreliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often\ninaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy\nOptimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context\nlearning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.\nICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands\nexploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced\nLRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert\nRegion Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and\nAnnealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with\nlater autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently\nenhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR\nparadigm for LRMs.",

The experimental results\ndemonstrate the proposed framework capability to detect real and synthetic\nanomalies effectively generated from real attack data, showing that the models\nprovide not only correct identification of anomalies but also explainable\nresults that enable the reconstruction of the possible origin of the anomaly.\nOur findings suggest that the proposed UEBA framework can be seamlessly\nintegrated into enterprise environments, complementing existing security\nsystems for explainable threat detection.",

    "title": "Co-Evolving Latent Action World Models",
    "summary": "Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models\nvia latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world\nmodels. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent\naction model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant\ntraining and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple\nand appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with\na powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and\nprone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which\nfor the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving\nthe core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that\neffectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the\npre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model\nacts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,\nwhile the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the\nworld model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage\nmethods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,\nestablishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.",

    "summary": "Speech signal analysis poses significant challenges, particularly in tasks\nsuch as speech quality evaluation and profiling, where the goal is to predict\nmultiple perceptual and objective metrics. For instance, metrics like PESQ\n(Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality), STOI (Short-Time Objective\nIntelligibility), and MOS (Mean Opinion Score) each capture different aspects\nof speech quality. However, these metrics often have different scales,\nassumptions, and dependencies, making joint estimation non-trivial. To address\nthese issues, we introduce ARECHO (Autoregressive Evaluation via Chain-based\nHypothesis Optimization), a chain-based, versatile evaluation system for speech\nassessment grounded in autoregressive dependency modeling. ARECHO is\ndistinguished by three key innovations: (1) a comprehensive speech information\ntokenization pipeline; (2) a dynamic classifier chain that explicitly captures\ninter-metric dependencies; and (3) a two-step confidence-oriented decoding\nalgorithm that enhances inference reliability. Experiments demonstrate that\nARECHO significantly outperforms the baseline framework across diverse\nevaluation scenarios, including enhanced speech analysis, speech generation\nevaluation, and, noisy speech evaluation. Furthermore, its dynamic dependency\nmodeling improves interpretability by capturing inter-metric relationships.\nAcross tasks, ARECHO offers reference-free evaluation using its dynamic\nclassifier chain to support subset queries (single or multiple metrics) and\nreduces error propagation via confidence-oriented decoding.",

    "summary": "Multimodal learning faces two major challenges: modality imbalance and data\nnoise, which significantly affect the robustness and generalization ability of\nmodels. Existing methods achieve modality balance by suppressing dominant\nmodalities, but they neglect the inherent differences in the information value\nbetween modalities, potentially leading to convergence to suboptimal solutions.\nThis paper proposes an innovative modality compression paradigm,\nContribution-Guided Asymmetric Learning (CAL), which aims to enhance the\ncontribution of high-contribution modalities while compressing weak modalities\nto increase their contribution, allowing both to improve the performance of\nmultimodal information fusion. CAL is based on a modality contribution metric\nW^m combining the information quantity I(m) and confidence D(m), and it designs\nan asymmetric gradient acceleration mechanism and a contribution-aware\nAsymmetric Information Bottleneck (AIB) compression mechanism. The former\naccelerates the gradient update of modalities, while the latter dynamically\ncompresses the noise of low-contribution modalities.\n  On five benchmark datasets, including emotion recognition, scene recognition,\nand event localization tasks, CAL has shown outstanding performance in\nimbalanced fusion tasks and noise robustness tests. On CREMA-D, KS, and AVE,\nCAL achieves 79.30%, 74.82%, and 74.21% accuracy, significantly outperforming\nthe existing state-of-the-art model ARL. In high-noise robustness tests, CAL\nalso achieved leading performance under various attack strategies on the\nMVSA-Single and NYUD2 datasets. These results validate the significant\nadvantages of CAL in modality imbalance and noise interference. CAL, as a\nflexible and efficient framework, is easy to transfer to other tasks and has\nbroad adaptability and potential application prospects.",

    "summary": "Vision-Language Large Models (VLLMs) face significant efficiency challenges\nwhen processing high-resolution inputs. The quadratic complexity in attention\nand autoregressive generation, as well as the constantly growing key value (KV)\ncache size, severely hinder the prefilling and decoding stages. Recent efforts\nhave attempted to compress KV cache by identifying and pruning KV cache of less\nimportant tokens, but these methods typically rely on attention scores to\nestimate token importance, making them incompatible with efficient attention\nmechanisms such as FlashAttention and Sparse Attention, which do not explicitly\ncompute attention matrices. Moreover, existing methods overlook how sparse\nattention, while accelerating the prefilling stage, alters the information\nstructure of the KV cache, thereby compromising the effectiveness of downstream\nKV cache compression strategies. To address this issue, we propose PureKV, a\nplug-and-play framework for joint optimization of sparse attention and KV cache\ncompression. We first introduce a KV cache compression strategy that is fully\ncompatible with efficient attention accelerators. Our method utilizes lower\nlayer attention scores to estimate the importance of high layers' KV cache,\nenabling active pruning without compromising accuracy. In addition, we have\ndesigned a Spatial-Temporal Sparse Attention (ST-SpAttn) module specifically\ntailored for video KV cache compression algorithms. This module combines\nspatial and temporal attention sparsity to improve the compression efficiency\nof KV cache optimization algorithms by purifying spatial noise and temporal\nredundancy in KV cache. At the same time, ST-SpAttn also accelerated the\nprefilling stage of VLLMs. Extensive experiments on VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2,\nQwen2.5-VL) have shown that PureKV achieves 5.0 times KV cache compression and\n3.16 times prefill acceleration, with negligible quality degradation.",

    "summary": "Redirected walking utilizes gain adjustments within perceptual thresholds to\nallow natural navigation in large scale virtual environments within confined\nphysical environments. Previous research has found that when users are\ndistracted by some scene elements, they are less sensitive to gain values.\nHowever, the effects on detection thresholds have not been quantitatively\nmeasured. In this paper, we present a novel method that dynamically adjusts\ntranslation gain by leveraging visual distractors. We place distractors within\nthe user's field of view and apply a larger translation gain when their\nattention is drawn to them. Because the magnitude of gain adjustment depends on\nthe user's level of engagement with the distractors, the redirection process\nremains smooth and unobtrusive. To evaluate our method, we developed a task\noriented virtual environment for a user study. Results show that introducing\ndistractors in the virtual environment significantly raises users' translation\ngain thresholds. Furthermore, assessments using the Simulator Sickness\nQuestionnaire and Igroup Presence Questionnaire indicate that the method\nmaintains user comfort and acceptance, supporting its effectiveness for RDW\nsystems.",

    "summary": "While the generation of 3D content from single-view images has been\nextensively studied, the creation of physically consistent 3D dynamic scenes\nfrom videos remains in its early stages. We propose a novel framework\nleveraging generative 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models to extract and\nre-simulate 3D dynamic fluid objects from single-view videos using simulation\nmethods. The fluid geometry represented by 3DGS is initially generated and\noptimized from single-view images, then denoised, densified, and aligned across\nframes. We estimate the fluid surface velocity using optical flow, propose a\nmainstream extraction algorithm to refine it. The 3D volumetric velocity field\nis then derived from the velocity of the fluid's enclosed surface. The velocity\nfield is therewith converted into a divergence-free, grid-based representation,\nenabling the optimization of simulation parameters through its\ndifferentiability across frames. This process outputs simulation-ready fluid\nassets with physical dynamics closely matching those observed in the source\nvideo. Our approach is applicable to various liquid fluids, including inviscid\nand viscous types, and allows users to edit the output geometry or extend\nmovement durations seamlessly. This automatic method for creating 3D dynamic\nfluid assets from single-view videos, easily obtainable from the internet,\nshows great potential for generating large-scale 3D fluid assets at a low cost.",

    "summary": "In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become\nwidely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,\napproaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to\njointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short\nstochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step\nconsistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump\ngeneration, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a\ntrajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a\ndenoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and\non a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step\nDDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing\nlatency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow\ninference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a\npractical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.",

We use FLYINGTRUST to compare\nrepresentative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches\nunder identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario\ncombination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal\nsystematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform\ncapability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct\npreferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions.

    "summary": "The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and\nembodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,\nscalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing\napproaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical\nframeworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent\nmemory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long\nhorizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting\nthe need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,\nand robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel\nSpatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene\ngeometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared\nrepresentation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a\nbrain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global\nplanning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute\nactions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution\nenables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent\nstate synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex\ncoordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results\ndemonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous\nembodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and\nrobust multi-robot collaboration.

Central to the approach is a computationally efficient and\ncontinuously differentiable condition for detecting collisions with ellipsoidal\nobstacles. A novel two-stage optimization approach mitigates numerical issues\narising from the structure of the resulting optimal control problem. The\neffectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through simulations and\nreal-world experiments with the Crazyflie quadrotor. This represents the first\nhardware demonstration of an MPC controller of this kind for UAVs in a\nthree-dimensional task.",

    "summary": "Quadrotors can carry slung loads to hard-to-reach locations at high speed.\nSince a single quadrotor has limited payload capacities, using a team of\nquadrotors to collaboratively manipulate a heavy object is a scalable and\npromising solution. However, existing control algorithms for multi-lifting\nsystems only enable low-speed and low-acceleration operations due to the\ncomplex dynamic coupling between quadrotors and the load, limiting their use in\ntime-critical missions such as search and rescue. In this work, we present a\nsolution to significantly enhance the agility of cable-suspended multi-lifting\nsystems. Unlike traditional cascaded solutions, we introduce a trajectory-based\nframework that solves the whole-body kinodynamic motion planning problem\nonline, accounting for the dynamic coupling effects and constraints between the\nquadrotors and the load. The planned trajectory is provided to the quadrotors\nas a reference in a receding-horizon fashion and is tracked by an onboard\ncontroller that observes and compensates for the cable tension. Real-world\nexperiments demonstrate that our framework can achieve at least eight times\ngreater acceleration than state-of-the-art methods to follow agile\ntrajectories. Our method can even perform complex maneuvers such as flying\nthrough narrow passages at high speed. Additionally, it exhibits high\nrobustness against load uncertainties and does not require adding any sensors\nto the load, demonstrating strong practicality.",

In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical\nfoundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on\ngeometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the\nsimilarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive\nan abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these\nsystems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems.

We demonstrate this using bimanual\nmanipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments\nfor reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments\nusing differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric\nprimitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can\nbe exploited for introducing secondary control objectives.

    "summary": "Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue\napplications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while\nperforming intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,\nenabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such\nconditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a\nhumanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich\nenvironments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive\ntorso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like\nresponses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional\nchallenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning\narchitecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each\ncomponent shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its\nparameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially\noutperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot\nachieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body\nweight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing\nimprovements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the\nbest-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack\n(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N).

To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual\nnavigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path\nanti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns\nmulti-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure\nrepresentation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features\nwithin the action decoder to ensure policy consistency.

Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and\naccuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational\nresources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA).\nHowever, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual\nlandmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and\nplanning methods require different map representations. In this work, we\ntherefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without\nreconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By\nrestricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry\nrepresentations, our `2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with\ncompetitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent\nadvancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate\ntrajectory optimization without BA. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse\ndatasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of\nthe trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size.

    "summary": "Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans\nperceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different\nlevels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,\nextending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories\ninto a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.",

    "summary": "Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with\nchildren, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and\ndistress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises\ncomplex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds\nare broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative\nsurvey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is\nviewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and\ngovernment. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and\nparental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of\nwhether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters\npropose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while\nopponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.\nUltimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared\nresponsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by\ndetailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete\ndesign and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot\ndiscontinuation.",

The method is\nvalidated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion\nprimitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning.

These limitations are particularly\napparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms\nstruggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is\nimportant, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe\nautonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful\nopportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised\nphysical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate\novertaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.\nThis research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning\nto reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and\nreality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against\nopponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results\ndemonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate\novertaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent\ntrained just to race.",

    "title": "A New Type of Axis-Angle Attitude Control Law for Rotational Systems:\n  Synthesis, Analysis, and Experiments",
    "summary": "Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has\nbeen proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled\nas rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this\napproach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium\nattitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the\nattitude-error Euler axis larger than {\\pi}rad, their proportional-control\neffect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of\nthe CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude\ncontrol law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle\ninformation to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater\nflexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two\ndifferent control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict\nLyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique\nequilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly\nasymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and\nperformance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and\nexecuted dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.\nThese simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed\naxis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that\nobtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of\nstabilization time.",

    "summary": "Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications\nsuch as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive\ndevices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However,\nmost existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their\naccuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This\nlimitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this\nchallenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile\nsensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved\nsurfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict\nlocal curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,\nachieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily\nobjects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that\nthe curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all\nsurfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature\nincreases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the\naccuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling\ndependable performance across real-world applications.",

This\nwork aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a\nrepresentation--specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are\nrisk-aware. To this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding\nof the environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace\nguidance fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's\nequation to generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its\n0-superlevel set. We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's\nequation to synthesize a safe \\textit{guidance field} that encodes variable\nlevels of caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary\ncondition. The safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define\na safety constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which,\ngiven a semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of\nenvironmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of\nhigher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how\n\\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated\ninto the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.",

Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation\nsuch as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is\ninconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded\nprogress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision\nthat generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware,\nvideo-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task\nstages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from\nnatural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation\nacross variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index\nlabeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our\nreward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to\nout-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building\non it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters\nhigh-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward\nmodel alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts.\nIntegrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83% success on folding T-shirts\nfrom the flattened state and 67% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing\nvanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8% and 0% success.

In each\nround, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a\ncontrol agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design.
