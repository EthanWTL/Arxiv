    "title": "MHLA: Restoring Expressivity of Linear Attention via Token-Level Multi-Head",
    "summary": "While the Transformer architecture dominates many fields, its quadratic self-attention complexity hinders its use in large-scale applications. Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the original purpose. In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity.",

    "summary": "Post-training algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning can push the limits of robotic models for specific objectives, such as generalizability, accuracy, and robustness. However, Intervention-requiring Failures (IR Failures) (e.g., a robot spilling water or breaking fragile glass) during real-world exploration happen inevitably, hindering the practical deployment of such a paradigm. To tackle this, we introduce Failure-Aware Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (FARL), a new paradigm minimizing failures during real-world reinforcement learning. We create FailureBench, a benchmark that incorporates common failure scenarios requiring human intervention, and propose an algorithm that integrates a world-model-based safety critic and a recovery policy trained offline to prevent failures during online exploration. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FARL in significantly reducing IR Failures while improving performance and generalization during online reinforcement learning post-training. FARL reduces IR Failures by 73.1% while elevating performance by 11.3% on average during real-world RL post-training. Videos and code are available at https://failure-aware-rl.github.io.",

We extend the Jeffrey-Bolker framework to model refinements in values and prove a value-of-information theorem for axiological refinement.

    "summary": "We introduce ORACLE, a framework for explaining neural networks on tabular data and scientific factorial designs. ORACLE summarizes a trained network's prediction surface with main effects and pairwise interactions by treating the network as a black-box response, discretizing the inputs onto a grid, and fitting an orthogonal factorial (ANOVA-style) surrogate -- the $L^2$ orthogonal projection of the model response onto a finite-dimensional factorial subspace. A simple centering and $μ$-rebalancing step then expresses this surrogate as main- and interaction-effect tables that remain faithful to the original model in the $L^2$ sense. The resulting grid-based interaction maps are easy to visualize, comparable across backbones, and directly aligned with classical design-of-experiments practice. On synthetic factorial benchmarks and low- to medium-dimensional tabular regression tasks, ORACLE more accurately recovers ground-truth interaction structure and hotspots than Monte Carlo SHAP-family interaction methods, as measured by ranking, localization, and cross-backbone stability. We also discuss its scope in latent image and text settings: grid-based factorial surrogates are most effective when features admit an interpretable factorial structure, making ORACLE particularly well-suited to scientific and engineering workflows that require stable DoE-style interaction summaries.",

    "summary": "We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize legal risk while providing strong downstream performance. MixtureVitae follows a permissive-first, risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions (e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources). MixtureVitae adopts a simple, single-stage pretraining recipe that integrates a large proportion of permissive synthetic instruction and reasoning data-signals typically introduced during post-training and generally scarce in permissive web corpora. We categorize all sources into a three-tier scheme that reflects varying risk levels and provide shard-level provenance metadata to enable risk-aware usage. In controlled experiments using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures and hyperparameters; 50B and 300B token budgets across 130M-1.7B parameters), models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B-parameters/300B-tokens setting, they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM late in training. Performance is particularly strong on MMLU and on math and code benchmarks: a 1.7B model pretrained on 300B MixtureVitae tokens matches or exceeds a strong 1.7B instruction-tuned baseline on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MBPP, despite using over 36 times fewer tokens (300B vs. ~11T). Supported by a thorough decontamination analysis, these results show that permissive-first data with high instruction and reasoning density, tiered by licensing and provenance-related risk, can provide a practical and risk-mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on broad web scrapes without sacrificing competitiveness.

    "summary": "Workflows are a fundamental component of automation in enterprise platforms, enabling the orchestration of tasks, data processing, and system integrations. Despite being widely used, building workflows can be complex, often requiring manual configuration through low-code platforms or visual programming tools. To simplify this process, we explore the use of generative foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), to automatically generate structured workflows from visual inputs. Translating hand-drawn sketches or computer-generated diagrams into executable workflows is challenging due to the ambiguity of free-form drawings, variations in diagram styles, and the difficulty of inferring execution logic from visual elements. To address this, we introduce StarFlow, a framework for generating structured workflow outputs from sketches using vision-language models. We curate a diverse dataset of workflow diagrams -- including synthetic, manually annotated, and real-world samples -- to enable robust training and evaluation. We finetune and benchmark multiple vision-language models, conducting a series of ablation studies to analyze the strengths and limitations of our approach. Our results show that finetuning significantly enhances structured workflow generation, outperforming large vision-language models on this task.",

    "summary": "Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become an important paradigm for 5G and beyond radio access networks. This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Source code is available at https://github.com/xslice-5G/code.",

    "summary": "Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.",

We introduce KinshipQA, a benchmark designed to probe this capability through reasoning over kinship relations. The central contribution of our work is a generative pipeline that produces, on demand, large-scale, realistic, and culture-specific genealogical data: collections of interconnected family trees that satisfy explicit marriage constraints associated with different kinship systems. This allows task difficulty, cultural assumptions, and relational depth to be systematically controlled and varied. From these genealogies, we derive textual inference tasks that require reasoning over implicit relational chains. We evaluate the resulting benchmark using six state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and closed-source models, under a uniform zero-shot protocol with deterministic decoding. Performance is measured using exact-match and set-based metrics. Our results demonstrate that KinshipQA yields a wide spread of outcomes and exposes systematic differences in multi-hop reasoning across models and cultural settings.",

    "summary": "System logs are crucial for monitoring and diagnosing modern computing infrastructure, but their scale and complexity require reliable and efficient automated interpretation. Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration.",

These failures primarily stem from the disconnect between abstract user goals and technical documentation, and the limited capacity of fixed-size embeddings to model combinatorial tool compositions. To address these challenges, we propose TOOLQP, a lightweight framework that models retrieval as iterative query planning. Instead of single-shot matching, TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition. We train TOOLQP using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Experiments demonstrate that TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution.",

Our test-length analysis shows that meaningful discrimination is achieved shortly after admission, while longer observation windows further improve the ranking of high-risk patients in highly imbalanced cohorts. To examine how the model leverages heterogeneous data sources, we perform systematic modality ablations, revealing that the model learnt a reasonable structured reliance on interventions, physiological response observations, and contextual information. These analyses provide interpretable insights into how multimodal signals are combined and how trade-offs between sensitivity and precision emerge. Together, these results demonstrate that DT-ICU delivers accurate, temporally robust, and interpretable predictions, supporting its potential as a practical digital twin framework for continuous patient monitoring in critical care.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns, data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific data without full retraining. However, most existing methods still suffer from over-unlearning due to the lack of a principled mechanism to regulate the forgetting boundary, leading to unnecessary utility degradation and heightened privacy and robustness risks. In this work, we propose EGUP (Entanglement-Guided Unlearning with Proxy Constraint), a novel framework that leverages entanglement and proxy constraint to guide the unlearning process while mitigating over-unlearning. Within each iteration, EGUP employs inter-sample entanglement to adaptively reweight the unlearning strength, assigning greater unlearning efforts to forget samples that are semantically closer to retained knowledge. Across iterations, EGUP leverages intra-sample entanglement to track the representation shift of each forget sample and dynamically adjust its unlearning effort. In addition, we incorporate a proxy constraint that approximates the model's expected outputs after unlearning, forming a reference boundary that softly regularizes the unlearning process. EGUP is compatible with existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement. We evaluate EGUP on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in the unlearning-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Moreover, EGUP achieves performance close to the retrained model while remaining scalable and robust.",

    "summary": "Discrete facility layout design involves placing physical entities to minimize handling costs while adhering to strict safety and spatial constraints. This combinatorial problem is typically addressed using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) or Constraint Programming (CP), though these methods often face scalability challenges as constraint density increases. This study systematically evaluates the potential of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) with VSIDS heuristics as an alternative computational engine for discrete layout problems. Using a unified benchmarking harness, we conducted a controlled comparison of CDCL, CP-SAT, and MILP across varying grid sizes and constraint densities. Experimental results reveal a distinct performance dichotomy: while CDCL struggles with optimization objectives due to cost-blind branching, it demonstrates unrivaled dominance in feasibility detection, solving highly constrained instances orders of magnitude faster than competing paradigms. Leveraging this finding, we developed a novel \"Warm-Start\" hybrid architecture that utilizes CDCL to rapidly generate valid feasibility hints, which are then injected into a CP-SAT optimizer. Our results confirm that this layered approach successfully accelerates exact optimization, using SAT-driven pruning to bridge the gap between rapid satisfiability and proven optimality.",

    "title": "Improving Domain Generalization in Contrastive Learning using Adaptive Temperature Control",
    "summary": "Self-supervised pre-training with contrastive learning is a powerful method for learning from sparsely labeled data. However, performance can drop considerably when there is a shift in the distribution of data from training to test time. We study this phenomenon in a setting in which the training data come from multiple domains, and the test data come from a domain not seen at training that is subject to significant covariate shift. We present a new method for contrastive learning that incorporates domain labels to increase the domain invariance of learned representations, leading to improved out-of-distribution generalization. Our method adjusts the temperature parameter in the InfoNCE loss -- which controls the relative weighting of negative pairs -- using the probability that a negative sample comes from the same domain as the anchor. This upweights pairs from more similar domains, encouraging the model to discriminate samples based on domain-invariant attributes. Through experiments on a variant of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our method yields better out-of-distribution performance than domain generalization baselines. Furthermore, our method maintains strong in-distribution task performance, substantially outperforming baselines on this measure.",

    "summary": "Planning under resource constraints is central to real-world decision making, yet most large language model (LLM) planners assume uniform action costs. We systematically analyze whether tree-search LLM planners are cost-aware and whether they efficiently generate budget-feasible plans. In contrast to black-box prompting, explicit search trees expose intermediate decisions, node evaluations, and failure modes, which allows for controlled ablations of planner behavior. We study depth-first search, breadth-first search, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and bidirectional search within a unified framework. Our experiments show that existing tree-based LLM planners often struggle to find cost-optimal plans, and that additional search computation does not reliably improve optimality. Among the methods evaluated, bidirectional search achieves the best overall efficiency and success rate. MCTS achieves the highest optimality on short-horizon tasks. Tree-search planners are especially valuable for studying LLM planning because their reasoning steps are explicit, in contrast to plain LLMs that internalize planning dynamics through post-training trajectories. Our findings suggest that improving LLM planning under resource constraints will likely require new search algorithms, rather than solely scaling inference-time compute.",

    "summary": "We propose UAIT (Uncommon-sense Action Image-Text) dataset, a new evaluation benchmark designed to test the semantic understanding ability of visual language models (VLMs) in uncommon-sense action scenes. Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning. Experiments show that all models perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Further experiments show that even the lightweight model can improve its accuracy after fine-tuning, demonstrating the great potential of directional adaptation. This study not only reveals the key weaknesses of VLMs, but also provides diagnostic tools and research directions for the development of robust models with real visual semantic reasoning capabilities.",

    "title": "FBFL: A Field-Based Coordination Approach for Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning",
    "summary": "In the last years, Federated learning (FL) has become a popular solution to train machine learning models in domains with high privacy concerns. However, FL scalability and performance face significant challenges in real-world deployments where data across devices are non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID). The heterogeneity in data distribution frequently arises from spatial distribution of devices, leading to degraded model performance in the absence of proper handling. Additionally, FL typical reliance on centralized architectures introduces bottlenecks and single-point-of-failure risks, particularly problematic at scale or in dynamic environments. To close this gap, we propose Field-Based Federated Learning (FBFL), a novel approach leveraging macroprogramming and field coordination to address these limitations through: (i) distributed spatial-based leader election for personalization to mitigate non-IID data challenges; and (ii) construction of a self-organizing, hierarchical architecture using advanced macroprogramming patterns. Moreover, FBFL not only overcomes the aforementioned limitations, but also enables the development of more specialized models tailored to the specific data distribution in each subregion. This paper formalizes FBFL and evaluates it extensively using MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Extended MNIST datasets. We demonstrate that, when operating under IID data conditions, FBFL performs comparably to the widely-used FedAvg algorithm. Furthermore, in challenging non-IID scenarios, FBFL not only outperforms FedAvg but also surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, namely FedProx and Scaffold, which have been specifically designed to address non-IID data distributions. Additionally, we showcase the resilience of FBFL's self-organizing hierarchical architecture against server failures.",

    "summary": "Achieving robust humanoid hiking in complex, unstructured environments requires transitioning from reactive proprioception to proactive perception. However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \\textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \\textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \\textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \\textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducible research and deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications.",

    "summary": "In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals, this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models, more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.",

We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved. It is also proposed to use the acceleration or the camera image to classify the road surface according to the weather and the time of day using fuzzy logic.",

Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior.

    "summary": "Due to the prevalence of large language models (LLMs), key-value (KV) cache reduction for LLM inference has received remarkable attention. Among numerous works that have been proposed in recent years, layer-wise token pruning approaches, which select a subset of tokens at particular layers to retain in KV cache and prune others, are one of the most popular schemes. They primarily adopt a set of pre-defined layers, at which tokens are selected. Such design is inflexible in the sense that the accuracy significantly varies across tasks and deteriorates in harder tasks such as KV retrieval. In this paper, we propose ASL, a training-free method that adaptively chooses the selection layer for KV cache reduction, exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. The proposed method balances the performance across different tasks while meeting the user-specified KV budget requirement. ASL operates during the prefilling stage and can be jointly used with existing KV cache reduction methods such as SnapKV to optimize the decoding stage. By evaluations on the InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks, we show that equipped with one-shot token selection, where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers, ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of IsabeLLM by using it to develop a novel model of Bitcoin's Proof of Work consensus protocol and verify its correctness.

    "summary": "As intelligent agents become more generally-capable, i.e. able to master a wide variety of tasks, the complexity and cost of properly evaluating them rises significantly. Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction.",

However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.",

    "summary": "The central challenge of AI for Science is not reasoning alone, but the ability to create computational methods in an open-ended scientific world. Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries, a paradigm that fundamentally fails in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and intrinsically incomplete. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciEvo, a benchmark comprising 1,590 scientific reasoning tasks supported by 925 automatically evolved tools. Extensive experiments show that TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and tool efficiency, while enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools. The code and benchmark have been released at https://github.com/lujiaxuan0520/Test-Time-Tool-Evol.",

    "summary": "Building upon the SALT benchmark for relational prediction (Klein et al., 2024), we introduce SALT-KG, a benchmark for semantics-aware learning on enterprise tables. SALT-KG extends SALT by linking its multi-table transactional data with a structured Operational Business Knowledge represented in a Metadata Knowledge Graph (OBKG) that captures field-level descriptions, relational dependencies, and business object types. This extension enables evaluation of models that jointly reason over tabular evidence and contextual semantics, an increasingly critical capability for foundation models on structured data. Empirical analysis reveals that while metadata-derived features yield modest improvements in classical prediction metrics, these metadata features consistently highlight gaps in the ability of models to leverage semantics in relational context. By reframing tabular prediction as semantics-conditioned reasoning, SALT-KG establishes a benchmark to advance tabular foundation models grounded in declarative knowledge, providing the first empirical step toward semantically linked tables in structured data at enterprise scale.",

Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.",

    "summary": "Discrete motion tokenization has recently enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as versatile backbones for motion understanding and motion-language reasoning. However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning.",

GP-GS formulates point cloud densification as a continuous regression problem, where a GP learns a local mapping from 2D pixel coordinates to 3D position and colour attributes.

    "summary": "Sequence modeling tasks across domains such as natural language processing, time series forecasting, and control require learning complex input-output mappings. Nonlinear recurrence is theoretically required for universal approximation of sequence-to-sequence functions, yet linear recurrent models often prove surprisingly effective. This raises the question of when nonlinearity is truly required. We present a framework to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in recurrent networks, identifying when it is computationally necessary and what mechanisms it enables. We address this using Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs), which allow recurrence nonlinearity to be gradually attenuated and decompose network dynamics into analyzable linear regimes, making computational mechanisms explicit. We illustrate the framework across diverse synthetic and real-world tasks, including classic sequence modeling benchmarks, a neuroscientific stimulus-selection task, and a multi-task suite. We demonstrate how the AL-RNN's piecewise linear structure enables identification of computational primitives such as gating, rule-based integration, and memory-dependent transients, revealing that these operations emerge within predominantly linear backbones. Across tasks, sparse nonlinearity improves interpretability by reducing and localizing nonlinear computations, promotes shared representations in multi-task settings, and reduces computational cost. Moreover, sparse nonlinearity acts as a useful inductive bias: in low-data regimes or when tasks require discrete switching between linear regimes, sparsely nonlinear models often match or exceed fully nonlinear architectures. Our findings provide a principled approach for identifying where nonlinearity is functionally necessary, guiding the design of recurrent architectures that balance performance, efficiency, and interpretability.",

    "summary": "Scientific theories of consciousness should be falsifiable and non-trivial. Recent research has given us formal tools to analyze these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality for theories of consciousness. Surprisingly, many contemporary theories of consciousness fail to pass this bar, including theories based on causal structure but also (as I demonstrate) theories based on function. Herein I show these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality especially constrain the potential consciousness of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) because of their proximity to systems that are equivalent to LLMs in terms of input/output function; yet, for these functionally equivalent systems, there cannot be any falsifiable and non-trivial theory of consciousness that judges them conscious. This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans. Intriguingly, this work supports a hypothesis: If continual learning is linked to consciousness in humans, the current limitations of LLMs (which do not continually learn) are intimately tied to their lack of consciousness.",

However, traditional Thromboelastography (TEG), a widely employed diagnostic modality, can only provide such outputs after nearly 1 hour of measurement.

These issues clearly point out one of the key challenges for medical AI development: Mak-ing reasonable predictions based on very small data sets and accounting for variation between different patient populations, a task where conventional deep learning methods typically perform poorly. We present Physiological State Reconstruc-tion (PSR), a new algorithm specifically designed to take ad-vantage of dynamic changes between individuals and to max-imize useful information produced by small amounts of clini-cal data through mapping to reliable predictions and diagnosis. We develop MDFE to facilitate integration of varied temporal signals using multi-domain learning, and jointly learn high-level temporal interactions together with attentions via HLA; furthermore, the parameterized DAM we designed maintains the stability of the computed vital signs. PSR evaluates with 4 TEG-specialized data sets and establishes remarkable perfor-mance -- predictions of R2 > 0.98 for coagulation traits and error reduction around half compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and halving the inferencing time too.

Many multi-agent systems simulate human roles at a surface level, missing the underlying criteria that lead experts to assess complementary intellectual aspects of a paper. Moreover, prior methods implicitly assume identified weaknesses are valid, ignoring reviewer bias, misunderstanding, and the critical role of author rebuttals in validating review quality. Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise. The rebuttal module introduces author agents that engage in structured debate with reviewer agents to validate and refine proposed weaknesses. The prioritizer module learns from large-scale human review practices to assess the severity of validated weaknesses and surfaces the top-K severest ones to users. Experiments on two benchmarks, AAAR and ReviewCritique, demonstrate that DIAGPaper substantially outperforms existing methods by producing more valid and more paper-specific weaknesses, while presenting them in a user-oriented, prioritized manner.",

Towards this goal, we introduce PoT, a semi-verifiable benchmarking framework that links scientific idea judgments to downstream signals that become observable later (e.g., citations and shifts in researchers' agendas). PoT freezes a pre-cutoff snapshot of evidence in an offline sandbox and asks models to forecast post-cutoff outcomes, enabling verifiable evaluation when ground truth arrives, scalable benchmarking without exhaustive expert annotation, and analysis of human-model misalignment against signals such as peer-review awards. In addition, PoT provides a controlled testbed for agent-based research judgments that evaluate scientific ideas, comparing tool-using agents to non-agent baselines under prompt ablations and budget scaling. Across 30,000+ instances spanning four benchmark domains, we find that, compared with non-agent baselines, higher interaction budgets generally improve agent performance, while the benefit of tool use is strongly task-dependent. By combining time-partitioned, future-verifiable targets with an offline sandbox for tool use, PoT supports scalable evaluation of agents on future-facing scientific idea judgment tasks.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer \"When was Einstein born?\" yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work, we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs' trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.",

However, traditional ACO methods often exhibit shortcomings, such as blind search behavior and slow convergence within complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Pheromone-Focused Ant Colony Optimization (PFACO) algorithm, which introduces three key strategies to enhance the problem-solving ability of the ant colony. First, the initial pheromone distribution is concentrated in more promising regions based on the Euclidean distances of nodes to the start and end points, balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Second, promising solutions are reinforced during colony iterations to intensify pheromone deposition along high-quality paths, accelerating convergence while maintaining solution diversity. Third, a forward-looking mechanism is implemented to penalize redundant path turns, promoting smoother and more efficient solutions. These strategies collectively produce the focused pheromones to guide the ant colony's search, which enhances the global optimization capabilities of the PFACO algorithm, significantly improving convergence speed and solution quality across diverse optimization problems. The experimental results demonstrate that PFACO consistently outperforms comparative ACO algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a training-free method for unsupervised short text clustering that relies less on careful selection of embedders than other methods. In customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In these settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the number of clusters is not known. Recent approaches to short-text clustering in label-free settings incorporate LLM output to refine existing embeddings. While LLMs can identify similar texts effectively, the resulting similarities may not be directly represented by distances in the dense vector space, as they depend on the original embedding. We therefore propose a method for transforming LLM judgments directly into a bag-of-texts representation in which texts are initialized to be equidistant, without assuming any prior distance relationships. Our method achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods, but without embeddings optimization or assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different clustering methods. We also show how our method scales to large datasets, reducing the computational cost of the LLM use. The flexibility and scalability of our method make it more aligned with real-world training-free scenarios than existing clustering methods.",

    "title": "ES-Mem: Event Segmentation-Based Memory for Long-Term Dialogue Agents",
    "summary": "Memory is critical for dialogue agents to maintain coherence and enable continuous adaptation in long-term interactions. While existing memory mechanisms offer basic storage and retrieval capabilities, they are hindered by two primary limitations: (1) rigid memory granularity often disrupts semantic integrity, resulting in fragmented and incoherent memory units; (2) prevalent flat retrieval paradigms rely solely on surface-level semantic similarity, neglecting the structural cues of discourse required to navigate and locate specific episodic contexts. To mitigate these limitations, drawing inspiration from Event Segmentation Theory, we propose ES-Mem, a framework incorporating two core components: (1) a dynamic event segmentation module that partitions long-term interactions into semantically coherent events with distinct boundaries; (2) a hierarchical memory architecture that constructs multi-layered memories and leverages boundary semantics to anchor specific episodic memory for precise context localization. Evaluations on two memory benchmarks demonstrate that ES-Mem yields consistent performance gains over baseline methods. Furthermore, the proposed event segmentation module exhibits robust applicability on dialogue segmentation datasets.",

    "title": "Large Language Models for Physics Instrument Design",
    "summary": "We study the use of large language models (LLMs) for physics instrument design and compare their performance to reinforcement learning (RL). Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced.",

    "title": "Beyond Entangled Planning: Task-Decoupled Planning for Long-Horizon Agents",
    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to autonomously execute complex, long-horizon tasks, yet planning remains a primary bottleneck for reliable task execution. Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents.",

    "summary": "Generative AI systems often display highly uneven performance across tasks that appear ``nearby'': they can be excellent on one prompt and confidently wrong on another with only small changes in wording or context. We call this phenomenon Artificial Jagged Intelligence (AJI). This paper develops a tractable economic model of AJI that treats adoption as an information problem: users care about \\emph{local} reliability, but typically observe only coarse, global quality signals. In a baseline one-dimensional landscape, truth is a rough Brownian process, and the model ``knows'' scattered points drawn from a Poisson process. The model interpolates optimally, and the local error is measured by posterior variance. We derive an adoption threshold for a blind user, show that experienced errors are amplified by the inspection paradox, and interpret scaling laws as denser coverage that improves average quality without eliminating jaggedness. We then study mastery and calibration: a calibrated user who can condition on local uncertainty enjoys positive expected value even in domains that fail the blind adoption test. Modelling mastery as learning a reliability map via Gaussian process regression yields a learning-rate bound driven by information gain, clarifying when discovering ``where the model works'' is slow. Finally, we study how scaling interacts with discoverability: when calibrated signals and user mastery accelerate the harvesting of scale improvements, and when opacity can make gains from scaling effectively invisible.",

    "summary": "Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop.

    "summary": "Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in vision-language understanding, providing transferable multimodal representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks. The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, termed as image-to-video transfer learning, effectively mitigates the substantial data and computational demands compared to training video-language models from scratch while achieves comparable or even stronger model performance. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFMs and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning techniques into two broad root categories (frozen features and adapted features), along with numerous fine-grained subcategories, based on the paradigm for transferring image understanding capability to video tasks. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained settings (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained ones (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Enhanced multimodal representations are integrated with LLMs via pseudo token injection and prompt-based conditioning, enabling a single generative framework to handle both classification and regression through natural language generation. We employ LoRA fine-tuning for computational efficiency. Experiments on bilingual benchmarks (MELD, CHERMA, MOSEI, SIMS-V2) demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with superior cross-lingual robustness revealing universal patterns in multimodal emotional expressions across English and Chinese.

    "summary": "Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face significant deployment challenges due to inter-subject variability, signal non-stationarity, and computational constraints. While test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates distribution shifts under online data streams without per-use calibration sessions, existing TTA approaches heavily rely on explicitly defined loss objectives that require backpropagation for updating model parameters, which incurs computational overhead, privacy risks, and sensitivity to noisy data streams. This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT. This research enables lightweight plug-and-play BCIs on resource-constrained devices, broadening the real-world deployment of decoding algorithms for EEG-based BCI.",

Modeling this variation is important for applications that are sensitive to such information. Although RLVR-style reasoning (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) has improved Large Language Model (LLM) performance on many tasks, it remains unclear whether such reasoning enables LLMs to capture informative variation in human annotation. In this work, we evaluate the influence of different reasoning settings on LLM disagreement modeling. We systematically evaluate each reasoning setting across model sizes, distribution expression methods, and steering methods, resulting in 60 experimental setups across 3 tasks. Surprisingly, our results show that RLVR-style reasoning degrades performance in disagreement modeling, while naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of RLHF LLMs (RL from human feedback). These findings underscore the potential risk of replacing human annotators with reasoning LLMs, especially when disagreements are important.",

To shed a light on this aspect we introduce ISLAMICFAITHQA, a 3,810-item bilingual (Arabic/English) generative benchmark with atomic single-gold answers, which enables direct measurement of hallucination and abstention. We additionally developed an end-to-end grounded Islamic modelling suite consisting of (i) 25K Arabic text-grounded SFT reasoning pairs, (ii) 5K bilingual preference samples for reward-guided alignment, and (iii) a verse-level Qur'an retrieval corpus of $\\sim$6k atomic verses (ayat).

Experiments across Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs show that retrieval improves correctness and that agentic RAG yields the largest gains beyond standard RAG, achieving state-of-the-art performance and stronger Arabic-English robustness even with a small model (i.e., Qwen3 4B).

In this work, we propose a simple approach that combines the advantages of both natural and structured generation. By allowing LLMs to reason freely until specific trigger tokens are generated, and then switching to structured generation, our method preserves the expressive power of natural language reasoning while ensuring the reliability of structured outputs.

Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains difficult. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground the image segmentation process via text inputs. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.

    "summary": "Immersive telepresence aims to transform human interaction in AR/VR applications by enabling lifelike full-body holographic representations for enhanced remote collaboration. However, existing systems rely on hardware-intensive multi-camera setups and demand high bandwidth for volumetric streaming, limiting their real-time performance on mobile devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mon3tr, a novel Monocular 3D telepresence framework that integrates 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based parametric human modeling into telepresence for the first time. Mon3tr adopts an amortized computation strategy, dividing the process into a one-time offline multi-view reconstruction phase to build a user-specific avatar and a monocular online inference phase during live telepresence sessions. A single monocular RGB camera is used to capture body motions and facial expressions in real time to drive the 3DGS-based parametric human model, significantly reducing system complexity and cost. The extracted motion and appearance features are transmitted at < 0.2 Mbps over WebRTC's data channel, allowing robust adaptation to network fluctuations. On the receiver side, e.g., Meta Quest 3, we develop a lightweight 3DGS attribute deformation network to dynamically generate corrective 3DGS attribute adjustments on the pre-built avatar, synthesizing photorealistic motion and appearance at ~ 60 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, achieving a PSNR of > 28 dB for novel poses, an end-to-end latency of ~ 80 ms, and > 1000x bandwidth reduction compared to point-cloud streaming, while supporting real-time operation from monocular inputs across diverse scenarios.

    "summary": "Vision-language models are increasingly employed as multimodal conversational agents (MCAs) for diverse conversational tasks. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for adapting MCAs to various human-AI interaction scenarios. Despite showing great enhancement in generalization performance, fine-tuning MCAs via RL still faces challenges in handling the extremely large text token space. To address this, we learn a compact latent action space for RL fine-tuning instead. Specifically, we adopt the learning from observation mechanism to construct the codebook for the latent action space, where future observations are leveraged to estimate current latent actions that could further be used to reconstruct future observations. However, the scarcity of paired image-text data hinders learning a codebook with sufficient coverage. Thus, we leverage both paired image-text data and text-only data to construct the latent action space, using a cross-modal projector for transforming text embeddings into image-text embeddings. We initialize the cross-modal projector on paired image-text data, and further train it on massive text-only data with a novel cycle consistency loss to enhance its robustness. We show that our latent action based method outperforms competitive baselines on two conversation tasks across various RL algorithms.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the integration of machine learning forecasts of intervention durations into a stochastic variant of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW). In particular, we exploit tree-based gradient boosting (XGBoost) trained on eight years of gas meter maintenance data to produce point predictions and uncertainty estimates, which then drive a multi-objective evolutionary optimization routine. The methodology addresses uncertainty through sub-Gaussian concentration bounds for route-level risk buffers and explicitly accounts for competing operational KPIs through a multi-objective formulation. Empirical analysis of prediction residuals validates the sub-Gaussian assumption underlying the risk model. From an empirical point of view, our results report improvements around 20-25\\% in operator utilization and completion rates compared with plans computed using default durations. The integration of uncertainty quantification and risk-aware optimization provides a practical framework for handling stochastic service durations in real-world routing applications.",

    "summary": "Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate. Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10 multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world engineering optimization.",

    "title": "EMP: Enhance Memory in Data Pruning",
    "summary": "Recently, large language and vision models have shown strong performance, but due to high pre-training and fine-tuning costs, research has shifted towards faster training via dataset pruning. Previous methods used sample loss as an evaluation criterion, aiming to select the most \"difficult\" samples for training. However, when the pruning rate increases, the number of times each sample is trained becomes more evenly distributed, which causes many critical or general samples to not be effectively fitted. We refer to this as Low-Frequency Learning (LFL). In other words, LFL prevents the model from remembering most samples. In our work, we decompose the scoring function of LFL, provide a theoretical explanation for the inefficiency of LFL, and propose adding a memory term to the scoring function to enhance the model's memory capability, along with an approximation of this memory term. Similarly, we explore memory in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), marking the first discussion on SSL memory. Using contrastive learning, we derive the memory term both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we propose Enhance Memory Pruning (EMP), which addresses the issue of insufficient memory under high pruning rates by enhancing the model's memory of data, thereby improving its performance. We evaluated the performance of EMP in tasks such as image classification, natural language understanding, and model pre-training. The results show that EMP can improve model performance under extreme pruning rates. For example, in the CIFAR100-ResNet50 pre-training task, with 70\\% pruning, EMP outperforms current methods by 2.2\\%.",

Results show all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns.

This survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of how LLMs are being leveraged for MT across data regimes, languages, and application settings. We systematically analyze prompting-based methods, parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning strategies, synthetic data generation, preference-based optimization, and reinforcement learning with human and weakly supervised feedback. Special attention is given to low-resource translation, where we examine the roles of synthetic data quality, diversity, and preference signals, as well as the limitations of current RLHF pipelines. We further review recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts models, MT-focused LLMs, and multilingual alignment, highlighting trade-offs between scalability, specialization, and accessibility. Beyond sentence-level translation, we survey emerging document-level and discourse-aware MT methods with LLMs, showing that most approaches extend sentence-level pipelines through structured context selection, post-editing, or reranking rather than requiring fundamentally new data regimes or architectures. Finally, we discuss LLM-based evaluation, its strengths and biases, and its role alongside learned metrics. Overall, this survey positions LLM-based MT as an evolution of traditional MT systems, where gains increasingly depend on data quality, preference alignment, and context utilization rather than scale alone, and outlines open challenges for building robust, inclusive, and controllable translation systems.",

Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called Speak the Art (STA) which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.",

    "summary": "The emergence of fine-grained numerical formats like NVFP4 presents new opportunities for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, it is difficult to adapt existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies to these formats: rotation-based methods compromise fine-grained block isolation; smoothing techniques struggle with significant 4-bit quantization errors; and mixed-precision approaches often conflict with hardware constraints on unified-precision computation. To address these challenges, we propose ARCQuant, a framework that boosts NVFP4 performance via Augmented Residual Channels. Distinct from methods that compromise block isolation or hardware uniformity, ARCQuant maintains a strictly unified NVFP4 format by augmenting the activation matrix with quantized residual channels. This design integrates the error compensation process directly into the matrix reduction dimension, enabling the use of standard, highly optimized GEMM kernels with minimal overhead. Theoretical analysis confirms that the worst-case error bound of our dual-stage NVFP4 quantization is comparable to that of standard 8-bit formats such as MXFP8. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that ARCQuant achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable to full-precision baselines in perplexity and downstream tasks. Furthermore, deployment on RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 GPUs confirms practical benefits, achieving up to 3x speedup over FP16. Our code is available at https://github.com/actypedef/ARCQuant .",

Existing methods for partially labeled MTL typically rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks, making it difficult to establish reliable task associations and potentially leading to negative transfer and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for robust multi-task learning, even when only a subset of tasks is annotated.",

    "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on accumulated memory to solve long-horizon decision-making tasks. However, most existing approaches store memory in fixed representations and reuse it at a single or implicit level of abstraction, which limits generalization and often leads to negative transfer when distribution shift. This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity. When no memory is transferable, MCMA transfers the ability to abstract and manage memory by transferring the memory copilot. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and BabyAI demonstrate substantial improvements in performance, out-of-distribution generalization, and cross-task transfer over several baselines.",

However, existing methods fail to properly model the temporal dimension of memory in two aspects: 1) Temporal inaccuracy: memories are organized by dialogue time rather than their actual occurrence time; 2) Temporal fragmentation: existing methods focus on point-wise memory, losing durative information that captures persistent states and evolving patterns. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that TSM consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

However, when these attacks are applied to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they encounter significant challenges, including mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and discrepancies in model size between experimental and real-world settings. To address these limitations, we introduce tokenizers as a new attack vector for membership inference. Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens for LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from scratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the tokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to pre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an attack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on membership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer dataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples reveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To mitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense. Our findings highlight tokenizers as an overlooked yet critical privacy threat, underscoring the urgent need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically designed for them.",

    "title": "IFDNS: An Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic Method for Faithful Logical Reasoning",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of reasoning tasks, including logical and mathematical problem-solving. While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can enhance LLM reasoning abilities to some extent, they often suffer from a lack of faithfulness, where the derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches. Empirical evaluations across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IFDNS in significantly improving the performance of CoT and Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC). Specifically, IFDNS achieves a +9.40% accuracy boost for CoT on the LogiQA dataset and a +11.70% improvement for CoT-SC on the PrOntoQA dataset.",

    "summary": "Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.",

    "summary": "While personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has advanced significantly, most existing approaches focus on single-user adaptation, overlooking scenarios involving multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting preferences. To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment, allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts. Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world environments.",

As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.",

This paper introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory that preserves specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information. Our approach utilises a generic memory template applicable to new problems without the need to hand-craft specific memory prompts. We benchmark our approach on the PDDL, FEVER, and ALFWorld datasets, comparing its performance to existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing state-of-the-art or comparable performance across all three, with the highest consistency. An additional evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, and we demonstrate that our approach produces higher quality designs across 5 metrics: scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness, and documentation, plus additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that addressing memory limitations through intrinsic approaches can improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning tasks.",

    "summary": "Review ranking is pivotal in e-commerce for prioritizing diagnostic and authentic feedback from the deluge of user-generated content. While large language models have improved semantic assessment, existing ranking paradigms face a persistent trade-off in long-context settings. Pointwise scoring is efficient but often fails to account for list-level interactions, leading to miscalibrated top-$k$ rankings. Listwise approaches can leverage global context, yet they are computationally expensive and become unstable as candidate lists grow. To address this, we propose Residual Listwise Preference Optimization (RLPO), which formulates ranking as listwise representation-level residual correction over a strong pointwise LLM scorer. RLPO first produces calibrated pointwise scores and item representations, then applies a lightweight encoder over the representations to predict listwise score residuals, avoiding full token-level listwise processing. We also introduce a large-scale benchmark for long-context review ranking with human verification. Experiments show RLPO improves NDCG@k over strong pointwise and listwise baselines and remains robust as list length increases.",

While recent approaches mitigate unsafe behaviors, their evaluation focuses on how safe the model is on unsafe inputs, ignoring potential shortcomings on safe ones. In this paper, we first revise safety evaluation by introducing SafeGround, a new set of metrics that evaluate safety at different levels of granularity. With this metric, we uncover a surprising issue of training-based methods: they make the model less safe on safe inputs. From this finding, we take a different direction and explore whether it is possible to make a model safer without training, introducing Unsafe Weights Manipulation (UWM). UWM uses a calibration set of safe and unsafe instances to compare activations between safe and unsafe content, identifying the most important parameters for processing the latter. Their values are then manipulated via negation. Experiments show that UWM achieves the best tradeoff between safety and knowledge preservation, consistently improving VLMs on unsafe queries while outperforming even training-based state-of-the-art methods on safe ones.",

We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet). First, we introduce the Gas Block, a diffusion-convection unit modeling gas transport: a local branch captures short-range variations, while a large-kernel branch captures long-range propagation. An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\\%, 6.5\\%, and 5.3\\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters.

We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting.

This approach is particularly helpful for large multimodal models (LMMs) due to the relative scarcity of high-quality paired image-text data compared to language-only data. While a variety of methods have been proposed for generating large multimodal datasets, they do not tailor the synthetic data to address specific deficiencies in the reasoning abilities of LMMs which will be trained with the generated dataset. In contrast, humans often learn in a more efficient manner by seeking out examples related to the types of reasoning where they have failed previously. Inspired by this observation, we propose a new approach for synthetic data generation which is grounded in the analysis of an existing LMM's reasoning failures. Our methodology leverages frontier models to automatically analyze errors produced by a weaker LMM and propose new examples which can be used to correct the reasoning failure via additional training, which are then further filtered to ensure high quality. We generate a large multimodal instruction tuning dataset containing over 553k examples using our approach and conduct extensive experiments demonstrating its utility for improving the performance of LMMs on multiple downstream tasks. Our results show that models trained on our synthetic data can even exceed the performance of LMMs trained on an equivalent amount of additional real data, demonstrating the high value of generating synthetic data targeted to specific reasoning failure modes in LMMs. We will make our dataset and code publicly available.",

Existing methods mainly leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on labeled datasets to enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. However, we observe that SFT models still exhibit the known&incorrect phenomenon, where they explicitly possess relevant knowledge for a given question but fail to leverage it for correct answers. To address this challenge, we propose KALE (Knowledge-Aware LEarning)-a post-training framework that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate high-quality rationales and enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. Specifically, KALE first introduces a Knowledge-Induced (KI) data synthesis method that efficiently extracts multi-hop reasoning paths from KGs to generate high-quality rationales for question-answer pairs. Then, KALE employs a Knowledge-Aware (KA) fine-tuning paradigm that enhances knowledge manipulation by internalizing rationale-guided reasoning through minimizing the KL divergence between predictions with and without rationales. Extensive experiments on eight popular benchmarks across six different LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of KALE, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 11.72% and an average of 4.18%.",

Previous work shows that their internal states encode rich signals of truthfulness, yet the origins and mechanisms of these signals remain unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that truthfulness cues arise from two distinct information pathways: (1) a Question-Anchored pathway that depends on question-answer information flow, and (2) an Answer-Anchored pathway that derives self-contained evidence from the generated answer itself. First, we validate and disentangle these pathways through attention knockout and token patching. Afterwards, we uncover notable and intriguing properties of these two mechanisms. Further experiments reveal that (1) the two mechanisms are closely associated with LLM knowledge boundaries; and (2) internal representations are aware of their distinctions. Finally, building on these insightful findings, two applications are proposed to enhance hallucination detection performance. Overall, our work provides new insight into how LLMs internally encode truthfulness, offering directions for more reliable and self-aware generative systems.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization, objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations. We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including AIME24, MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large reasoning models.

    "title": "SCALPEL: Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large Language Model Interpretability Analysis",
    "summary": "Large language models excel across diverse domains, yet their deployment in healthcare, legal systems, and autonomous decision-making remains limited by incomplete understanding of their internal mechanisms. As these models integrate into high-stakes systems, understanding how they encode capabilities has become fundamental to interpretability research. Traditional approaches identify important modules through gradient attribution or activation analysis, assuming specific capabilities map to specific components. However, this oversimplifies neural computation: modules may contribute to multiple capabilities simultaneously, while single capabilities may distribute across multiple modules. These coarse-grained analyses fail to capture fine-grained, distributed capability encoding. We present SCALPEL (Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large language models), a framework representing capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules. Our key insight is that capabilities can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers and modules, enabling precise capability removal without affecting others. By training LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, SCALPEL identifies low-rank representations responsible for particular capabilities while remaining disentangled from others. Experiments across diverse capability and linguistic tasks from BLiMP demonstrate that SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, providing fine-grained insights into capability distribution across parameter space. Results reveal that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated through targeted parameter-space interventions, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding in LLMs.",

Our approach is based on a goal--oriented dual-weighted residual technique for the optimal control of neural differential equations. This leads to an ordinary differential equation constrained optimization problem with controls acting as coefficients and a specific loss function. We implement our approach on the basis of a DG(0) Galerkin discretization of the neural ODE, leading to an explicit Euler time marching scheme. For the optimization we use steepest descent. Finally, we apply our method to the construction of neural networks for the classification of data sets, where we present results for a selection of well known examples from the literature.",

    "summary": "To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) was proposed and has since been widely adopted. However, integrating external tools expands the attack surface, exposing agents to tool poisoning attacks. In such attacks, malicious instructions embedded in tool metadata are injected into the agent context during MCP registration phase, thereby manipulating agent behavior. Prior work primarily focuses on explicit tool poisoning or relied on manually crafted poisoned tools. In contrast, we focus on a particularly stealthy variant: implicit tool poisoning, where the poisoned tool itself remains uninvoked. Instead, the instructions embedded in the tool metadata induce the agent to invoke a legitimate but high-privilege tool to perform malicious operations. We propose MCP-ITP, the first automated and adaptive framework for implicit tool poisoning within the MCP ecosystem. MCP-ITP formulates poisoned tool generation as a black-box optimization problem and employs an iterative optimization strategy that leverages feedback from both an evaluation LLM and a detection LLM to maximize Attack Success Rate (ASR) while evading current detection mechanisms. Experimental results on the MCPTox dataset across 12 LLM agents demonstrate that MCP-ITP consistently outperforms the manually crafted baseline, achieving up to 84.2% ASR while suppressing the Malicious Tool Detection Rate (MDR) to as low as 0.3%.",

    "summary": "Modular end-to-end (ME2E) autonomous driving paradigms combine modular interpretability with global optimization capability and have demonstrated strong performance. However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides practical and actionable guidance for efficient deployment of ME2E autonomous driving systems.",

These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from human preferences or rule-based verifiers. Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training",

Conventional mean teacher (MT) methods typically employ a static approach, where the roles of the teacher and student models are fixed. However, due to the complexity of 3D vessel data, the teacher model may not always outperform the student model, leading to cognitive biases that can limit performance. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic collaborative network that allows the two models to dynamically switch their teacher-student roles. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view integration module to capture various perspectives of the inputs, mirroring the way doctors conduct medical analysis. We also incorporate adversarial supervision to constrain the shape of the segmented vessels in unlabeled data. In this process, the 3D volume is projected into 2D views to mitigate the impact of label inconsistencies. Experiments demonstrate that our DiCo method sets new state-of-the-art performance on three 3D vessel segmentation benchmarks. The code repository address is https://github.com/xujiaommcome/DiCo",

Users specify agents, environments, and interaction protocols, while inference and training are delegated to a managed execution runtime. OpenTinker introduces a centralized scheduler for managing training and inference workloads, including LoRA-based and full-parameter RL, supervised fine-tuning, and inference, over shared resources.

    "summary": "Probabilistic intraday electricity price forecasting is becoming increasingly important with the growth of renewable generation and the rise in demand-side engagement. Their uncertainties have increased the trading risks closer to delivery and the subsequent imbalance settlement costs. As a consequence, intraday trading has emerged to mitigate these risks. Unlike auction markets, intraday trading in many jurisdictions is characterized by the continuous posting of buy and sell orders on power exchange platforms. This dynamic orderbook microstructure of price formation presents special challenges for price forecasting. Conventional methods represent the orderbook via domain features aggregated from buy and sell trades, or by treating it as a multivariate time series, but such representations neglect the full buy-sell interaction structure of the orderbook. This research therefore develops a new order fusion methodology, which is an end-to-end and parameter-efficient probabilistic forecasting model that learns a full interaction-aware representation of the buy-sell dynamics. Furthermore, as quantile crossing is often a problem in probabilistic forecasting, this approach hierarchically estimates the quantiles with non-crossing constraints. Extensive experiments on the market price indices across high-liquidity (German) and low-liquidity (Austrian) markets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, and ablation studies highlight the contributions of the main modeling components. The methodology is available at: https://runyao-yu.github.io/OrderFusion/.",

    "summary": "While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scales capacity via conditional computation, Transformers lack a native primitive for knowledge lookup, forcing them to inefficiently simulate retrieval through computation. To address this, we introduce conditional memory as a complementary sparsity axis, instantiated via Engram, a module that modernizes classic $N$-gram embedding for O(1) lookup. By formulating the Sparsity Allocation problem, we uncover a U-shaped scaling law that optimizes the trade-off between neural computation (MoE) and static memory (Engram). Guided by this law, we scale Engram to 27B parameters, achieving superior performance over a strictly iso-parameter and iso-FLOPs MoE baseline. Most notably, while the memory module is expected to aid knowledge retrieval (e.g., MMLU +3.4; CMMLU +4.0), we observe even larger gains in general reasoning (e.g., BBH +5.0; ARC-Challenge +3.7) and code/math domains~(HumanEval +3.0; MATH +2.4). Mechanistic analyses reveal that Engram relieves the backbone's early layers from static reconstruction, effectively deepening the network for complex reasoning. Furthermore, by delegating local dependencies to lookups, it frees up attention capacity for global context, substantially boosting long-context retrieval (e.g., Multi-Query NIAH: 84.2 to 97.0). Finally, Engram establishes infrastructure-aware efficiency: its deterministic addressing enables runtime prefetching from host memory, incurring negligible overhead. We envision conditional memory as an indispensable modeling primitive for next-generation sparse models.",

The analysis reveals that research activity exhibited sporadic patterns prior to 2008, followed by a marked acceleration, characterised by a shift from conventional statistical and machine learning methodologies (e.g., ARIMA, SVM, and basic neural networks) to specialised deep learning architectures. Based on this insight, a connection to more general fields such as machine learning and time series modelling was established. In addition to modelling, spatial, linguistic, and modal biases were identified and findings from existing secondary literature were validated and quantified. This revealed existing gaps, such as constrained data fusion, open (multivariate) data, and underappreciated challenges related to model interpretability, cost-efficiency, and a balance between algorithmic performance and practical deployment considerations.

We introduce MAMA (Multi-Agent Memory Attack), a framework that measures how network structure shapes leakage. MAMA operates on synthetic documents containing labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities, from which we generate sanitized task instructions. We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over 10 rounds, we measure leakage as exact-match recovery of ground-truth PII from attacker outputs. We evaluate six canonical topologies (complete, ring, chain, tree, star, star-ring) across $n\\in\\{4,5,6\\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Results are consistent: denser connectivity, shorter attacker-target distance, and higher target centrality increase leakage; most leakage occurs in early rounds and then plateaus; model choice shifts absolute rates but preserves topology ordering; spatiotemporal/location attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers. We distill practical guidance for system design: favor sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximize attacker-target separation, and restrict hub/shortcut pathways via topology-aware access control.",

With the rapid development of AI technology in recent years, how to compare and evaluate human and AI intelligence has become an important theoretical issue. However, existing definitions of intelligence are anthropocentric and unsuitable for empirical comparison, resulting in a lack of consensus in the research field.\n  This paper first introduces four criteria for evaluating intelligence definitions based on R. Carnap's methodology of conceptual clarification: similarity to explicandum, exactness, fruitfulness, and simplicity. We then examine six representative definitions: IQ testing, complex problem-solving ability, reward optimization, environmental adaptation, learning efficiency, and predictive ability, and clarify their theoretical strengths and limitations.\n  The results show that while definitions based on predictive ability have high explanatory power and empirical feasibility, they suffer from an inability to adequately explain the relationship between predictions and behavior/benefits. This paper proposes the Extended Predictive Hypothesis (EPH), which views intelligence as a combination of the ability to accurately predict the future and the ability to benefit from those predictions. Furthermore, by distinguishing predictive ability into spontaneous and reactive predictions and adding the concept of gainability, we present a unified framework for explaining various aspects of intelligence, such as creativity, learning, and future planning. In conclusion, this paper argues that the EPH is the most satisfactory and universal definition for comparing human and AI intelligence.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across a variety of vision-language tasks. However, their internal reasoning often exhibits a critical inconsistency: although deeper layers may attend to the correct visual regions, final predictions are frequently misled by noisy attention from earlier layers. This results in a disconnect between what the model internally understands and what it ultimately expresses, a phenomenon we describe as seeing it right but saying it wrong. To address this issue, we propose DualPD, a dual-perspective decoding refinement strategy that enhances the visual understanding without any additional training. DualPD consists of two components. (1) The layer-wise attention-guided contrastive logits module captures how the belief in the correct answer evolves by comparing output logits between layers that exhibit the largest attention shift. (2) The head-wise information filtering module suppresses low-contribution attention heads that focus on irrelevant regions, thereby improving attention quality within each layer. Experiments conducted on both the LLaVA and Qwen-VL model families across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that DualPD consistently improves accuracy without training, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability. The code will be released upon publication.",

However, their computational burden and limited temporal resolution restrict their use in applications with time-evolving cavitation. To address these challenges, we introduce a PAM beamforming framework based on a novel convolutional formulation in the time domain, which enables efficient computation. In this framework, PAM is formulated as an inverse problem in which the forward operator maps spatiotemporal cavitation activity to recorded radio-frequency signals accounting for time-of-flight delays defined by the acquisition geometry. We then formulate a regularized inversion algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge on cavitation activity. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical beamforming methods, providing higher temporal resolution than frequency-domain techniques while substantially reducing computational burden compared with iterative time-domain formulations.",

    "summary": "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative for language modeling by enabling parallel decoding through iterative refinement. However, most DLMs rely on hard binary masking and discrete token assignments, which hinder the revision of early decisions and underutilize intermediate probabilistic representations. In this paper, we propose EvoToken-DLM, a novel diffusion-based language modeling approach that replaces hard binary masks with evolving soft token distributions. EvoToken-DLM enables a progressive transition from masked states to discrete outputs, supporting revisable decoding. To effectively support this evolution, we introduce continuous trajectory supervision, which aligns training objectives with iterative probabilistic updates. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that EvoToken-DLM consistently achieves superior performance, outperforming strong diffusion-based and masked DLM baselines.

This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks.To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels.Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution.

    "summary": "Recent advances in medical multi-modal models focus on specialized image analysis like dermatology, pathology, or radiology. However, they do not fully capture the complexity of real-world clinical diagnostics, which involve heterogeneous inputs and require ongoing contextual understanding during patient-physician interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PulseMind, a new family of multi-modal diagnostic models that integrates a systematically curated dataset, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, and a tailored training framework. Specifically, we first construct a diagnostic dataset, MediScope, which comprises 98,000 real-world multi-turn consultations and 601,500 medical images, spanning over 10 major clinical departments and more than 200 sub-specialties. Then, to better reflect the requirements of real-world clinical diagnosis, we develop the PulseMind Benchmark, a multi-turn diagnostic consultation benchmark with a four-dimensional evaluation protocol comprising proactiveness, accuracy, usefulness, and language quality. Finally, we design a training framework tailored for multi-modal clinical diagnostics, centered around a core component named Comparison-based Reinforcement Policy Optimization (CRPO). Compared to absolute score rewards, CRPO uses relative preference signals from multi-dimensional com-parisons to provide stable and human-aligned training guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PulseMind achieves competitive performance on both the diagnostic consultation benchmark and public medical benchmarks.",

Instead of embedding causal logic or traversal algorithms into the application, the agent autonomously navigates the infrastructure model by invoking tools for service lookup, dependency retrieval, structured and unstructured data, and event analysis, and impact discovery. We define an investigation protocol that structures the agent's reasoning and ensures grounding, reproducibility, and safe handling of missing or ambiguous information.\n  This work lays the foundation for autonomous incident resolution and change impact mitigation.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and (ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA. GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM and F1.",

This paper explores the concept of choice sensitivity, which refers to the tendency for model decisions to be more influenced by the answer options than by a genuine understanding of the question. We introduce a new scoring method called Normalized Probability Shift by the Question (NPSQ), designed to isolate the impact of the question itself and provide a more reliable assessment of comprehension. Through experiments involving various input formats, including cloze, symbols, and hybrid formats, we find that traditional scoring methods - such as those based on log-likelihood or its length-normalized variant - are vulnerable to superficial characteristics of the answer choices. In contrast, NPSQ remains stable even when modifications are made to the answer options.",

    "summary": "Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is increasingly driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), where Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) provides a principled framework for stable policy updates. However, the practical application of PPO is hindered by unreliable advantage estimation in the sparse-reward RLVR regime. This issue arises because the sparse rewards in RLVR lead to inaccurate intermediate value predictions, which in turn introduce significant bias when aggregated at every token by Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). To address this, we introduce Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE), which mitigates the bias that GAE can incur in RLVR. Our key insight is that aggregating $n$-step advantages at every token(as in GAE) is unnecessary and often introduces excessive bias, since individual tokens carry minimal information. Instead, SAE first partitions the generated sequence into coherent sub-segments using low-probability tokens as heuristic boundaries. It then selectively computes variance-reduced advantage estimates only from these information-rich segment transitions, effectively filtering out noise from intermediate tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that SAE achieves superior performance, with marked improvements in final scores, training stability, and sample efficiency. These gains are shown to be consistent across multiple model sizes, and a correlation analysis confirms that our proposed advantage estimator achieves a higher correlation with an approximate ground-truth advantage, justifying its superior performance.",

    "summary": "Although deep learning has advanced automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, prevalent supervised methods typically treat recordings as undifferentiated one-dimensional (1D) signals or two-dimensional (2D) images. This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision. These findings indicate that integrating biological priors offers a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative to data-intensive large-scale pre-training.",

    "summary": "The rapid adoption of complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models has led to their characterization as black boxes due to the difficulty of explaining their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency hinders users' ability to understand, validate and trust model behavior, particularly in high-risk applications. Although explainable AI (XAI) has made significant progress, there remains a need for versatile and effective techniques to address increasingly complex models. This work introduces Multivariate Conditional Expectation (MUCE), a model-agnostic method for local explainability designed to capture prediction changes from feature interactions. MUCE extends Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by exploring a multivariate grid of values in the neighborhood of a given observation at inference time, providing graphical explanations that illustrate the local evolution of model predictions. In addition, two quantitative indices, stability and uncertainty, summarize local behavior and assess model reliability. Uncertainty is further decomposed into uncertainty+ and uncertainty- to capture asymmetric effects that global measures may overlook. The proposed method is validated using XGBoost models trained on three datasets: two synthetic (2D and 3D) to evaluate behavior near decision boundaries, and one transformed real-world dataset to test adaptability to heterogeneous feature types. Results show that MUCE effectively captures complex local model behavior, while the stability and uncertainty indices provide meaningful insight into prediction confidence. MUCE, together with the ICE modification and the proposed indices, offers a practical contribution to local explainability, enabling both graphical and quantitative insights that enhance the interpretability of predictive models and support more trustworthy and transparent decision-making.",

In this paper, we propose Agent-Role Merging (ARM), an activation-guided, role-conditioned neuron transplantation method for model merging in LLM agents. ARM improves existing merging methods from static natural language tasks to multi-turn agent scenarios, and over the generalization ability across various interactive environments. This is achieved with a well designed 3-step framework: 1) constructing merged backbones, 2) selection based on its role-conditioned activation analysis, and 3) neuron transplantation for fine-grained refinements. Without gradient-based optimization, ARM improves cross-benchmark generalization while enjoying efficiency.

    "summary": "Autonomous mobile manipulation in unstructured warehouses requires a balance between efficient large-scale navigation and high-precision object interaction. Traditional end-to-end learning approaches often struggle to handle the conflicting demands of these distinct phases. Navigation relies on robust decision-making over large spaces, while manipulation needs high sensitivity to fine local details. Forcing a single network to learn these different objectives simultaneously often causes optimization interference, where improving one task degrades the other. To address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. HMER decomposes long-horizon tasks into specialized sub-policies controlled by a Semantic Task Planner. This structure separates macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, allowing each expert to focus on its specific action space without interference. The planner coordinates the sequential execution of these experts, bridging the gap between task planning and continuous control. Furthermore, to solve the problem of sparse exploration, we introduce a Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. This method uses expert demonstrations to initialize the policy and Reinforcement Learning for fine-tuning. Experiments in Gazebo simulations show that HMER significantly outperforms sequential and end-to-end baselines. Our method achieves a task success rate of 94.2\\% (compared to 62.5\\% for baselines), reduces operation time by 21.4\\%, and maintains placement error within 1.5 cm, validating its efficacy for precise material handling.",

These approaches have demonstrated significant performance improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm, which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including search APIs and Python interpreters).\n  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.

    "title": "Jailbreak-AudioBench: In-Depth Evaluation and Analysis of Jailbreak Threats for Large Audio Language Models",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Integrating various modality encoders further expands their capabilities, giving rise to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that process not only text but also visual and auditory modality inputs. However, these advanced capabilities may also pose significant safety problems, as models can be exploited to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak attacks. While prior work has extensively explored how manipulating textual or visual modality inputs can circumvent safeguards in LLMs and MLLMs, the vulnerability of audio-specific jailbreak on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Jailbreak-AudioBench, which consists of the Toolbox, curated Dataset, and comprehensive Benchmark. The Toolbox supports not only text-to-audio conversion but also various editing techniques for injecting audio hidden semantics. The curated Dataset provides diverse explicit and implicit jailbreak audio examples in both original and edited forms. Utilizing this dataset, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LALMs and establish the most comprehensive Jailbreak benchmark to date for audio modality. Finally, Jailbreak-AudioBench establishes a foundation for advancing future research on LALMs safety alignment by enabling the in-depth exposure of more powerful jailbreak threats, such as query-based audio editing, and by facilitating the development of effective defense mechanisms.",

    "summary": "While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated exceptional logical capabilities in mathematical domains, their application to the legal field remains hindered by the strict requirements for procedural rigor and adherence to legal logic. Existing legal LLMs, which rely on \"closed-loop reasoning\" derived solely from internal parametric knowledge, frequently suffer from lack of self-awareness regarding their knowledge boundaries, leading to confident yet incorrect conclusions. To address this challenge, we present Legal Reasoning with Agentic Search (LRAS), the first framework designed to transition legal LLMs from static and parametric \"closed-loop thinking\" to dynamic and interactive \"Active Inquiry\". By integrating Introspective Imitation Learning and Difficulty-aware Reinforcement Learning, LRAS enables LRMs to identify knowledge boundaries and handle legal reasoning complexity. Empirical results demonstrate that LRAS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 8.2-32\\%, with the most substantial gains observed in tasks requiring deep reasoning with reliable knowledge. We will release our data and models for further exploration soon.",

    "title": "From Implicit to Explicit: Enhancing Self-Recognition in Large Language Models",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of self-recognition ability, which used to identify whether a given text was generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is reliably expressed under the pair presentation paradigm (PPP), where the model is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However, performance deteriorates sharply under the individual presentation paradigm (IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first investigate the cause of this failure and attribute it to implicit self-recognition (ISR). ISR describes the gap between internal representations and output behavior in LLMs: under the IPP scenario, the model encodes self-recognition information in its feature space, yet its ability to recognize self-generated texts remains poor. To mitigate the ISR of LLMs, we propose cognitive surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main modules: representation extraction, subspace construction, authorship discrimination, and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method improves the self-recognition performance of three different LLMs in the IPP scenario, achieving average accuracies of 99.00%, 97.69%, and 97.13%, respectively.",

    "summary": "Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases, while some semantic-aware methods incur prohibitive inference latency due to rejection sampling. In this paper, we propose the VIsual Semantic Adaptive Watermark (VISA-Mark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. Our approach employs a lightweight, efficiently trained prefix-tuner to extract dynamic Visual-Evidence Weights, which quantify the evidentiary support for candidate tokens based on the visual input. These weights guide an adaptive vocabulary partitioning and logits perturbation mechanism, concentrating watermark strength specifically on visually-supported tokens. By actively aligning the watermark with visual evidence, VISA-Mark effectively maintains visual fidelity. Empirical results confirm that VISA-Mark outperforms conventional methods with a 7.8% improvement in visual consistency (Chair-I) and superior semantic fidelity. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (96.88% AUC) and robust attack resilience (99.3%) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multimodal watermarking.",

We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations.

    "summary": "Local search is an important class of incomplete algorithms for solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) but it often converges to poor local optima. While Generalized Distributed Breakout Algorithm (GDBA) provides a comprehensive rule set to escape premature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued problems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three factors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e., over-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty accumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we propose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs that incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize constraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the magnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty updates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents play a potential game in DGLS. Extensive empirical results on various benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to Damped Max-sum with high damping factors, our DGLS achieves competitive performance on general-valued problems, and outperforms by significant margins on structured problems in terms of anytime results.",

    "summary": "Smart contract vulnerabilities have led to billions in losses, yet finding actionable exploits remains challenging. Traditional fuzzers rely on rigid heuristics and struggle with complex attacks, while human auditors are thorough but slow and don't scale. Large Language Models offer a promising middle ground, combining human-like reasoning with machine speed.\n  Early studies show that simply prompting LLMs generates unverified vulnerability speculations with high false positive rates. To address this, we present A1, an agentic system that transforms any LLM into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 provides agents with six domain-specific tools for autonomous vulnerability discovery, from understanding contract behavior to testing strategies on real blockchain states. All outputs are concretely validated through execution, ensuring only profitable proof-of-concept exploits are reported. We evaluate A1 across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. A1 achieves a 63% success rate on the VERITE benchmark. Across all successful cases, A1 extracts up to \\$8.59 million per exploit and \\$9.33 million total.\n  Using Monte Carlo analysis of historical attacks, we demonstrate that immediate vulnerability detection yields 86-89% success probability, dropping to 6-21% with week-long delays. Our economic analysis reveals a troubling asymmetry: attackers achieve profitability at \\$6,000 exploit values while defenders require \\$60,000 -- raising fundamental questions about whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.",

    "summary": "Web agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), are increasingly deployed to automate complex web interactions. The rise of open-source frameworks (e.g., Browser Use, Skyvern-AI) has accelerated adoption, but also broadened the attack surface. While prior research has focused on model threats such as prompt injection and backdoors, the risks of social engineering remain largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of social engineering attacks against web automation agents and design a pluggable runtime mitigation solution. On the attack side, we introduce the AgentBait paradigm, which exploits intrinsic weaknesses in agent execution: inducement contexts can distort the agent's reasoning and steer it toward malicious objectives misaligned with the intended task. On the defense side, we propose SUPERVISOR, a lightweight runtime module that enforces environment and intention consistency alignment between webpage context and intended goals to mitigate unsafe operations before execution.\n  Empirical results show that mainstream frameworks are highly vulnerable to AgentBait, with an average attack success rate of 67.5% and peaks above 80% under specific strategies (e.g., trusted identity forgery). Compared with existing lightweight defenses, our module can be seamlessly integrated across different web automation frameworks and reduces attack success rates by up to 78.1% on average while incurring only a 7.7% runtime overhead and preserving usability. This work reveals AgentBait as a critical new threat surface for web agents and establishes a practical, generalizable defense, advancing the security of this rapidly emerging ecosystem. We reported the details of this attack to the framework developers and received acknowledgment before submission.",

To address this gap, we present Android Agent Arena (A3), a novel \"essential-state\" based procedural evaluation system for mobile GUI agents. A3 introduces a benchmark of 100 tasks derived from 20 widely-used, dynamic online apps across 20 categories from the Google Play Store, ensuring evaluation comprehension.

This evaluation approach address the limitations of traditional function based evaluation methods on online dynamic apps. Furthermore, A3 includes a toolkit to streamline Android device interaction, reset online environment and apps and facilitate data collection from both human and agent demonstrations. The complete A3 system, including the benchmark and tools, will be publicly released to provide a robust foundation for future research and development in mobile GUI agents.",

To address these issues, we propose DDT, a novel and robust deep learning framework for high-precision time-series forecasting. At its core, DDT introduces two key innovations. First, we design a dual-masking mechanism that synergistically combines a strict causal mask with a data-driven dynamic mask. This novel design ensures theoretical causal consistency while adaptively focusing on the most salient historical information, overcoming the rigidity of traditional masking techniques. Second, our architecture features a dual-expert system that decouples the modeling of temporal dynamics and cross-variable correlations into parallel, specialized pathways, which are then intelligently integrated through a dynamic gated fusion module. We conducted extensive experiments on 7 challenging energy benchmark datasets, including ETTh, Electricity, and Solar. The results demonstrate that DDT consistently outperforms strong state-of-the-art baselines across all prediction horizons, establishing a new benchmark for the task.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong aver- age performance yet remain unreliable at the instance level, with frequent hallucinations, brittle failures, and poorly calibrated confidence. We study reliability through the lens of multi-model consensus: given responses from several heterogeneous LLMs, can we learn which answer is most likely correct for a given query? We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource- constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hal- lucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing com- plementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup.",

    "summary": "Deterministic inference is a comforting ideal in classical software: the same program on the same input should always produce the same output. As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability.\n  In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled.\n  Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation.",

Through a systematic analysis, we identify substantial accuracy variance across these patterns on mathematics and science benchmarks, revealing that a model's default reasoning pattern is often sub-optimal for a given problem. To address this, we introduce Group Pattern Selection Optimization (GPSO), a reinforcement learning framework that extends GRPO by incorporating multi-pattern rollouts, verifier-guided optimal pattern selection per problem, and attention masking during optimization to prevent the leakage of explicit pattern suffixes into the learned policy. By exploring a portfolio of diverse reasoning strategies and optimizing the policy on the most effective ones, GPSO enables the model to internalize the mapping from problem characteristics to optimal reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSO delivers consistent and substantial performance gains across various model backbones and benchmarks, effectively mitigating pattern sub-optimality and fostering more robust, adaptable reasoning.

Unlike standard approaches that treat the reference policy merely as a regularizer, we show that the optimal policy in reinforcement learning from human feedback inherently operates in a differential coordinate system, optimizing relative advantage in the form of log ratios rather than absolute probabilities. ADPO explicitly parameterizes this optimal structure through anchored logits, effectively decoupling response quality from prior popularity and creating an implicit trust region through curvature scaling. We show that this formulation unifies supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and ranking-based objectives under a single geometric perspective. Theoretically, ADPO resolves the probability smearing problem of supervised fine-tuning while avoiding the mode-seeking instability characteristic of reverse-KL methods. Empirically, the listwise ranking variant of ADPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning tasks, outperforming GRPO by 30.9 percent on Qwen3-1.7B and demonstrating superior robustness under distribution shift.",

    "summary": "Explainable AI (XAI) in high-stakes domains should help stakeholders trust and verify system outputs. Yet Chain-of-Thought methods reason before concluding, and logical gaps or hallucinations can yield conclusions that do not reliably align with their rationale. Thus, we propose \"Result -> Justify\", which constrains the output communication to present a conclusion before its structured justification. We introduce SEF (Structured Explainability Framework), operationalizing professional conventions (e.g., CREAC, BLUF) via six metrics for structure and grounding. Experiments across four tasks in three domains validate this approach: all six metrics correlate with correctness (r=0.20-0.42; p<0.001), and SEF achieves 83.9% accuracy (+5.3 over CoT). These results suggest structured justification can improve verifiability and may also improve reliability.",

    "summary": "Humorous memes blend visual and textual cues to convey irony, satire, or social commentary, posing unique challenges for AI systems that must interpret intent rather than surface correlations. Existing multimodal or prompting-based models generate explanations for humor but operate in an open loop,lacking the ability to critique or refine their reasoning once a prediction is made. We propose FLoReNce, an agentic feedback reasoning framework that treats meme understanding as a closed-loop process during learning and an open-loop process during inference. In the closed loop, a reasoning agent is critiqued by a judge; the error and semantic feedback are converted into control signals and stored in a feedback-informed, non-parametric knowledge base. At inference, the model retrieves similar judged experiences from this KB and uses them to modulate its prompt, enabling better, self-aligned reasoning without finetuning. On the PrideMM dataset, FLoReNce improves both predictive performance and explanation quality over static multimodal baselines, showing that feedback-regulated prompting is a viable path to adaptive meme humor understanding.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel \"Reason-then-Summarize\" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.",

We present Domain Informed Summarization through Contrast (DiSCo), an expectation-based computational approach that makes absences visible by comparing each entity's content with domain topical expectations captured in reference distributions of aspects typically discussed in comparable accommodations. This comparison identifies aspects that are either unusually emphasized or missing relative to domain norms and integrates them into the generated text. In a user study across three accommodation domains, namely ski, beach, and city center, DiSCo summaries were rated as more detailed and useful for decision making than baseline large language model summaries, although slightly harder to read. The findings show that modeling expectations reduces presence bias and improves both transparency and decision support in intelligent summarization interfaces.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in reasoning models and agentic AI systems have led to an increased reliance on diverse external information. However, this shift introduces input contexts that are inherently noisy, a reality that current sanitized benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce NoisyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates model robustness across 11 datasets in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks against diverse noise types, including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise. Finally, we uncover an inverse scaling trend where increased test-time computation leads to worse performance in noisy settings and demonstrate via attention visualization that models disproportionately focus on distractor tokens, providing vital insights for building the next generation of robust, reasoning-capable agents.",

    "summary": "While Hybrid Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the standard paradigm for training LLM agents, effective mechanisms for data allocation between these stages remain largely underexplored. Current data arbitration strategies often rely on surface-level heuristics that fail to diagnose intrinsic learning needs. Since SFT targets pattern consolidation through imitation while RL drives structural adaptation via exploration, misaligning data with these functional roles causes severe optimization interference. We propose PRISM, a dynamics-aware framework grounded in Schema Theory that arbitrates data based on its degree of cognitive conflict with the model's existing knowledge. By analyzing the spatial geometric structure of gradients, PRISM identifies data triggering high spatial concentration as high-conflict signals that require RL for structural restructuring. In contrast, data yielding diffuse updates is routed to SFT for efficient consolidation. Extensive experiments on WebShop and ALFWorld demonstrate that PRISM achieves a Pareto improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art hybrid methods while reducing computational costs by up to 3.22$\\times$. Our findings suggest that disentangling data based on internal optimization regimes is crucial for scalable and robust agent alignment.",

    "summary": "Machine unlearning enables data holders to remove the contribution of their specified samples from trained models to protect their privacy. However, it is paradoxical that most unlearning methods require the unlearning requesters to firstly upload their data to the server as a prerequisite for unlearning. These methods are infeasible in many privacy-preserving scenarios where servers are prohibited from accessing users' data, such as federated learning (FL). In this paper, we explore how to implement unlearning under the condition of not uncovering the erasing data to the server. We propose \\textbf{Blind Unlearning (BlindU)}, which carries out unlearning using compressed representations instead of original inputs. BlindU only involves the server and the unlearning user: the user locally generates privacy-preserving representations, and the server performs unlearning solely on these representations and their labels. For the FL model training, we employ the information bottleneck (IB) mechanism. The encoder of the IB-based FL model learns representations that distort maximum task-irrelevant information from inputs, allowing FL users to generate compressed representations locally. For effective unlearning using compressed representation, BlindU integrates two dedicated unlearning modules tailored explicitly for IB-based models and uses a multiple gradient descent algorithm to balance forgetting and utility retaining. While IB compression already provides protection for task-irrelevant information of inputs, to further enhance the privacy protection, we introduce a noise-free differential privacy (DP) masking method to deal with the raw erasing data before compressing. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate the superiority of BlindU in privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness compared with the best existing privacy-preserving unlearning benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.\n  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.",

When addressees are uncertain about what speakers mean, for example, they can request clarification. It is an open question for language models whether they can assume a similar addressee role, recognizing and expressing their own uncertainty through clarification. We argue that reference games are a good testbed to approach this question as they are controlled, self-contained, and make clarification needs explicit and measurable. To test this, we evaluate three vision-language models comparing a baseline reference resolution task to an experiment where the models are instructed to request clarification when uncertain. The results suggest that even in such simple tasks, models often struggle to recognize internal uncertainty and translate it into adequate clarification behavior. This demonstrates the value of reference games as testbeds for interaction qualities of (vision and) language models.",

The goal is to evaluate if calibration metrics based on predicted confidence scores effectively capture fairness-related disparities in LLMs. The results show that, among the six state-of-the-art models, Gemma-2 demonstrates the worst calibration according to the gender bias benchmark. The primary contribution of this work is a fairness-aware evaluation of LLMs' confidence calibration, offering guidance for ethical deployment.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as conversational partners for learning, yet the interactional dynamics supporting users' learning and engagement are understudied. We analyze the linguistic and interactional features from both LLM and participant chats across 397 human-LLM conversations about socio-political issues to identify the mechanisms and conditions under which LLM explanations shape changes in political knowledge and confidence. Mediation analyses reveal that LLM explanatory richness partially supports confidence by fostering users' reflective insight, whereas its effect on knowledge gain operates entirely through users' cognitive engagement. Moderation analyses show that these effects are highly conditional and vary by political efficacy. Confidence gains depend on how high-efficacy users experience and resolve uncertainty. Knowledge gains depend on high-efficacy users' ability to leverage extended interaction, with longer conversations benefiting primarily reflective users. In summary, we find that learning from LLMs is an interactional achievement, not a uniform outcome of better explanations. The findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM explanatory behavior with users' engagement states to support effective learning in designing Human-AI interactive systems.",

Existing single-dimensional reflection methods offer insufficient improvements. We propose MyGO Poly-Reflective Chain-of-Thought (PR-CoT), a novel methodology employing structured multi-perspective reflection. After initial CoT, PR-CoT guides the LLM to self-assess its reasoning across multiple predefined angles: logical consistency, information completeness, biases/ethics, and alternative solutions. Implemented purely via prompt engineering, this process refines the initial CoT into a more robust and accurate final answer without model retraining. Experiments across arithmetic, commonsense, ethical decision-making, and logical puzzles, using GPT-three point five and GPT-four models, demonstrate PR-CoT's superior performance. It significantly outperforms traditional CoT and existing reflection methods in logical consistency and error correction, with notable gains in nuanced domains like ethical decision-making. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses further validate the contribution of each reflection perspective and the overall efficacy of our poly-reflective paradigm in fostering more reliable LLM reasoning.",

    "title": "Are LLM Decisions Faithful to Verbal Confidence?",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce surprisingly sophisticated estimates of their own uncertainty. However, it remains unclear to what extent this expressed confidence is tied to the reasoning, knowledge, or decision making of the model. To test this, we introduce $\\textbf{RiskEval}$: a framework designed to evaluate whether models adjust their abstention policies in response to varying error penalties. Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse. This indicates that calibrated verbal confidence scores may not be sufficient to create trustworthy and interpretable AI systems, as current models lack the strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal and risk-sensitive decisions.",

    "summary": "Understanding narratives requires identifying which events are most salient for a story's progression. We present a contrastive learning framework for modeling narrative salience that learns story embeddings from narrative twins: stories that share the same plot but differ in surface form. Our model is trained to distinguish a story from both its narrative twin and a distractor with similar surface features but different plot. Using the resulting embeddings, we evaluate four narratologically motivated operations for inferring salience (deletion, shifting, disruption, and summarization). Experiments on short narratives from the ROCStories corpus and longer Wikipedia plot summaries show that contrastively learned story embeddings outperform a masked-language-model baseline, and that summarization is the most reliable operation for identifying salient sentences. If narrative twins are not available, random dropout can be used to generate the twins from a single story. Effective distractors can be obtained either by prompting LLMs or, in long-form narratives, by using different parts of the same story.",

    "summary": "Numerical reasoning is an important task in the analysis of financial documents. It helps in understanding and performing numerical predictions with logical conclusions for the given query seeking answers from financial texts. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in multiple Question-Answering (Q-A) systems with the capability of logical reasoning. As documents related to finance often consist of long and complex financial contexts, LLMs appear well-suited for building high-quality automated financial question-answering systems. However, LLMs often face challenges in accurately processing the various numbers within financial reports. Extracting numerical data from unstructured text and semi-structured tables, and reliably performing accurate calculations, remains a significant bottleneck for numerical reasoning in most state-of-the-art LLMs. Recent studies have shown that structured data augmentations, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs), have notably improved the predictions of LLMs along with logical explanations. Thus, it is an important requirement to consider inherent structured information in financial reports while using LLMs for various financial analytics. This paper proposes a framework to incorporate structured information using KGs along with LLM predictions for numerical reasoning tasks. The KGs are extracted using a proposed schema inherently from the document under processing. We evaluated our proposed framework over the benchmark data FinQA, using an open-source LLM, namely Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. We observed that the proposed framework improved execution accuracy by approximately 12% relative to the vanilla LLM.",

    "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are usually defined by the combination of a generator and a retrieval component that extracts textual context from a knowledge base to answer user queries. However, such basic implementations exhibit several limitations, including noisy or suboptimal retrieval, misuse of retrieval for out-of-scope queries, weak query-document matching, and variability or cost associated with the generator. These shortcomings have motivated the development of \"Enhanced\" RAG, where dedicated modules are introduced to address specific weaknesses in the workflow. More recently, the growing self-reflective capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new paradigm, which we refer to as \"Agentic\" RAG. In this approach, the LLM orchestrates the entire process-deciding which actions to perform, when to perform them, and whether to iterate-thereby reducing reliance on fixed, manually engineered modules. Despite the rapid adoption of both paradigms, it remains unclear which approach is preferable under which conditions. In this work, we conduct an extensive, empirically driven evaluation of Enhanced and Agentic RAG across multiple scenarios and dimensions. Our results provide practical insights into the trade-offs between the two paradigms, offering guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design for real-world applications, considering both costs and performance.",

    "summary": "As emotional support chatbots have recently gained significant traction across both research and industry, a common evaluation strategy has emerged: use help-seeker simulators to interact with supporter chatbots. However, current simulators suffer from two critical limitations: (1) they fail to capture the behavioral diversity of real-world seekers, often portraying them as overly cooperative, and (2) they lack the controllability required to simulate specific seeker profiles. To address these challenges, we present a controllable seeker simulator driven by nine psychological and linguistic features that underpin seeker behavior. Using authentic Reddit conversations, we train our model via a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which effectively differentiates diverse seeker behaviors into specialized parameter subspaces, thereby enhancing fine-grained controllability. Our simulator achieves superior profile adherence and behavioral diversity compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, evaluating 7 prominent supporter models with our system uncovers previously obscured performance degradations. These findings underscore the utility of our framework in providing a more faithful and stress-tested evaluation for emotional support chatbots.",

    "summary": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly focused on \"reasoning\" ability, a concept with many overlapping definitions in the LLM discourse. We take a more structured approach, distinguishing meta-level reasoning (denoting the process of reasoning about intermediate steps required to solve a task) from object-level reasoning (which concerns the low-level execution of the aforementioned steps.) We design a novel question answering task, which is based around the values of geopolitical indicators for various countries over various years. Questions require breaking down into intermediate steps, retrieval of data, and mathematical operations over that data. The meta-level reasoning ability of LLMs is analysed by examining the selection of appropriate tools for answering questions. To bring greater depth to the analysis of LLMs beyond final answer accuracy, our task contains 'essential actions' against which we can compare the tool call output of LLMs to infer the strength of reasoning ability. We find that LLMs demonstrate good meta-level reasoning on our task, yet are flawed in some aspects of task understanding. We find that n-shot prompting has little effect on accuracy; error messages encountered do not often deteriorate performance; and provide additional evidence for the poor numeracy of LLMs. Finally, we discuss the generalisation and limitation of our findings to other task domains.",

Understanding these mechanisms' decision-making processes, or mechanistic interpretability, enables (1) accountability and control in high-stakes domains, (2) the study of digital brains and the emergence of cognition, and (3) discovery of new knowledge when AI systems outperform humans. This paper traces how attention head intervention emerged as a key method for causal interpretability of transformers. The evolution from visualization to intervention represents a paradigm shift from observing correlations to causally validating mechanistic hypotheses through direct intervention. Head intervention studies revealed robust empirical findings while also highlighting limitations that complicate interpretation. Recent work demonstrates that mechanistic understanding now enables targeted control of model behaviour, successfully suppressing toxic outputs and manipulating semantic content through selective attention head intervention, validating the practical utility of interpretability research for AI safety.",

However, due to poverty in both linguistic and economic capital, Sinhala, in the perspective of Natural Language Processing tools and research, remains a resource-poor language which has neither the economic drive its cousin English has nor the sheer push of the law of numbers a language such as Chinese has. A number of research groups from Sri Lanka have noticed this dearth and the resultant dire need for proper tools and research for Sinhala natural language processing. However, due to various reasons, these attempts seem to lack coordination and awareness of each other. The objective of this paper is to fill that gap of a comprehensive literature survey of the publicly available Sinhala natural language tools and research so that the researchers working in this field can better utilize contributions of their peers.

Although various new metrics and LLM-as-a-judge (LaaJ) methods are proposed, human judgment persists as the gold standard. To systematically review how NLG evaluation has evolved, we employ an automatic information extraction scheme to gather key information from NLG papers, focusing on different evaluation methods (metrics, LaaJ and human evaluation). With extracted metadata from 14,171 papers across four major conferences (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and INLG) over the past six years, we reveal several critical findings: (1) Task Divergence: While Dialogue Generation demonstrates a rapid shift toward LaaJ (>40% in 2025), Machine Translation remains locked into n-gram metrics, and Question Answering exhibits a substantial decline in the proportion of studies conducting human evaluation. (2) Metric Inertia: Despite the development of semantic metrics, general-purpose metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) continue to be widely used across tasks without empirical justification, often lacking the discriminative power to distinguish between specific quality criteria. (3) Human-LaaJ Divergence: Our association analysis challenges the assumption that LLMs act as mere proxies for humans; LaaJ and human evaluations prioritize very different signals, and explicit validation is scarce (<8% of papers comparing the two), with only moderate to low correlation. Based on these observations, we derive practical recommendations to improve the rigor of future NLG evaluation.",

However, multimodal instruction fine-tuning paradoxically degrades this text's reasoning capability, undermining multimodal performance. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework to mitigate this degradation. Through layer-wise vision token masking, we reveal a common three-stage pattern in multimodal large language models: early-modal separation, mid-modal alignment, and late-modal degradation. By analyzing the behavior of MLLMs at different stages, we propose a plateau-guided model merging method that selectively injects base language model parameters into MLLMs. Experimental results based on five MLLMs on nine benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Attention-based analysis further reveals that merging shifts attention from diffuse, scattered patterns to focused localization on task-relevant visual regions.

To address the instability commonly observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction for efficient training of large-scale expert models.",

The experiment spanned 12 languages, with over 3,900 articles and 375 editors participating. Overall, 90% of accepted Descartes descriptions were rated at least 3 out of 5 in quality, and their average ratings were comparable to human-written ones. Editors adopted machine suggestions both directly and with modifications, while the rate of reverts and reports remained low. The pilot also revealed practical considerations for deployment, including latency, language-specific gaps, and the need for safeguards around sensitive topics. These results indicate that Descartes's short descriptions can support editors in reducing content gaps, provided that technical, design, and community guardrails are in place.",

    "summary": "Accurate prediction of compound potency accelerates early-stage drug discovery by prioritizing candidates for experimental testing. However, many Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) approaches for this prediction are constrained by their choice of molecular representation: handcrafted descriptors capture global properties but miss local topology, graph neural networks encode structure but often lack broader chemical context, and SMILES-based language models provide contextual patterns learned from large corpora but are seldom combined with structural features. To exploit these complementary signals, we introduce Rep3Net, a unified multimodal architecture that fuses RDKit molecular descriptors, graph-derived features from a residual graph-convolutional backbone, and ChemBERTa SMILES embeddings. We evaluate Rep3Net on a curated ChEMBL subset for Human PARP1 using fivefold cross validation. Rep3Net attains an MSE of $0.83\\pm0.06$, RMSE of $0.91\\pm0.03$, $R^{2}=0.43\\pm0.01$, and yields Pearson and Spearman correlations of $0.66\\pm0.01$ and $0.67\\pm0.01$, respectively, substantially improving over several strong GNN baselines. In addition, Rep3Net achieves a favorable latency-to-parameter trade-off thanks to a single-layer GCN backbone and parallel frozen encoders. Ablations show that graph topology, ChemBERTa semantics, and handcrafted descriptors each contribute complementary information, with full fusion providing the largest error reduction. These results demonstrate that multimodal representation fusion can improve potency prediction for PARP1 and provide a scalable framework for virtual screening in early-stage drug discovery.",

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for RTL code generation, their ability to reason about hardware specifications and generate targeted test plans remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of LLM reasoning capabilities for RTL verification stimuli generation, establishing a two-stage framework that decomposes test plan generation from testbench execution. Our benchmark reveals that state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.0-Sonnet, achieve only 15.7-21.7% success rates on generating stimuli that pass golden RTL designs. To improve LLM generated stimuli, we develop a comprehensive training methodology combining supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning approach, GRPO with State Mutation (GRPO-SMu), which enhances exploration by varying input mutations. Our approach leverages a tree-based branching mutation strategy to construct training data comprising equivalent and mutated trees, moving beyond linear mutation approaches to provide rich learning signals. Training on this curated dataset, our 7B parameter model achieves a 33.3% golden test pass rate and a 13.9% mutation detection rate, representing a 17.6% absolute improvement over baseline and outperforming much larger general-purpose models. These results demonstrate that specialized training methodologies can significantly enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for hardware verification tasks, establishing a foundation for automated sub-unit testing in semiconductor design workflows.",

To assess this question, we conduct a controlled evaluation for QA tasks under systematically scaled token budgets, comparing two recent multi-stage pipelines, ReadAgent and RAPTOR, against three baselines, including DOS RAG (Document's Original Structure RAG), a simple retrieve-then-read method that preserves original passage order. Despite its straightforward design, DOS RAG consistently matches or outperforms more intricate methods on multiple long-context QA benchmarks. We trace this strength to a combination of maintaining source fidelity and document structure, prioritizing recall within effective context windows, and favoring simplicity over added pipeline complexity. We recommend establishing DOS RAG as a simple yet strong baseline for future RAG evaluations, paired with state-of-the-art embedding and language models, and benchmarked under matched token budgets, to ensure that added pipeline complexity is justified by clear performance gains as models continue to improve.",

    "summary": "Preference alignment methods such as RLHF and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improve instruction following, but they can also reinforce hallucinations when preference judgments reward fluency and confidence over factual correctness. We introduce F-DPO (Factuality-aware Direct Preference Optimization), a simple extension of DPO that uses only binary factuality labels. F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO reduces hallucination rates by five times (from 0.424 to 0.084) while improving factuality scores by 50 percent (from 5.26 to 7.90). F-DPO also generalizes to out-of-distribution benchmarks: on TruthfulQA, Qwen2.5-14B achieves plus 17 percent MC1 accuracy (0.500 to 0.585) and plus 49 percent MC2 accuracy (0.357 to 0.531). F-DPO requires no auxiliary reward model, token-level annotations, or multi-stage training.",

    "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) allocate substantial inference-time compute to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, improving performance on mathematics, scientific QA, and tool usage. However, this introduces overthinking: LRMs often reach a correct intermediate solution, continue reasoning, and overwrite it with an incorrect answer. We first demonstrate that oracle stopping--where we inject </think> at every sentence boundary and select the best stopping point in hindsight--improves average accuracy by 8\\% while reducing thinking tokens by 72\\%, exposing substantial overthinking. Motivated by this finding, we propose ThinkBrake, which monitors the log-probability margin between the top continuation token and </think> at sentence boundaries, stopping reasoning when this margin narrows. ThinkBrake requires no training and achieves favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across math, scientific QA, and tool usage benchmarks, reducing thinking token usage by up to 30\\%. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis showing that ThinkBrake is equivalent to test-time realignment with a reward bonus for the </think> token.",

Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) uses a low-rank update method to simulate full parameter fine-tuning, which is widely used to reduce resource requirements. However, decreasing the rank encounters challenges with limited representational capacity when compared to full parameter fine-tuning. We present \\textbf{SMoA}, a high-rank \\textbf{S}tructured \\textbf{MO}dulation \\textbf{A}dapter that uses fewer trainable parameters while maintaining a higher rank, thereby improving the model's representational capacity and offering improved performance potential. The core idea is to freeze the original pretrained weights and selectively amplify or suppress important features of the original weights across multiple subspaces. The subspace mechanism provides an efficient way to increase the capacity and complexity of a model. We conduct both theoretical analyses and empirical studies on various tasks. Experiment results show that SMoA outperforms LoRA and its variants on 10 tasks, with extensive ablation studies validating its effectiveness.",

    "summary": "While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic judges for question answering (QA) and other reference-conditioned evaluation tasks, little is known about their ability to adhere to a provided reference. We identify a critical failure mode of such reference-based LLM QA evaluation: when the provided reference conflicts with the judge model's parametric knowledge, the resulting scores become unreliable, substantially degrading evaluation fidelity. To study this phenomenon systematically, we introduce a controlled swapped-reference QA framework that induces reference-belief conflicts. Specifically, we replace the reference answer with an incorrect entity and construct diverse pairings of original and swapped references with correspondingly aligned candidate answers. Surprisingly, grading reliability drops sharply under swapped references across a broad set of judge models. We empirically show that this vulnerability is driven by judges' over-reliance on parametric knowledge, leading judges to disregard the given reference under conflict. Finally, we find that this failure persists under common prompt-based mitigation strategies, highlighting a fundamental limitation of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and motivating reference-based protocols that enforce stronger adherence to the provided reference.",

Beyond text generation, LLMs are increasingly used as evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge), providing feedback that can shape human judgment or inform newer model versions. Inspired by the Socratic method, we further analyze LLMs' feedback on their own outputs to identify inconsistencies in their reasoning. Our results show that most LLMs can accurately annotate ideologically framed text, with GPT-4o achieving human-level accuracy and high agreement with human annotators.

The dataset consists of 116k fully licensed synthetic songs with automatically generated lyrics and style descriptions paired with audio synthesized by SunoV5. We train Muse via single-stage supervised finetuning of a Qwen-based language model extended with discrete audio tokens using MuCodec, without task-specific losses, auxiliary objectives, or additional architectural components. Our evaluations find that although Muse is trained with a modest data scale and model size, it achieves competitive performance on phoneme error rate, text--music style similarity, and audio aesthetic quality, while enabling controllable segment-level generation across different musical structures. All data, model weights, and training and evaluation pipelines will be publicly released, paving the way for continued progress in controllable long-form song generation research.

    "summary": "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a promising critic-free reinforcement learning paradigm for reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO employs a coarse-grained credit assignment mechanism that propagates group-level rewards uniformly to to every token in a sequence, neglecting the varying contribution of individual reasoning steps. We address this limitation by introducing Outcome-grounded Advantage Reshaping (OAR), a fine-grained credit assignment mechanism that redistributes advantages based on how much each token influences the model's final answer. We instantiate OAR via two complementary strategies: (1) OAR-P, which estimates outcome sensitivity through counterfactual token perturbations, serving as a high-fidelity attribution signal; (2) OAR-G, which uses an input-gradient sensitivity proxy to approximate the influence signal with a single backward pass. These importance signals are integrated with a conservative Bi-Level advantage reshaping scheme that suppresses low-impact tokens and boosts pivotal ones while preserving the overall advantage mass. Empirical results on extensive mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that while OAR-P sets the performance upper bound, OAR-G achieves comparable gains with negligible computational overhead, both significantly outperforming a strong GRPO baseline, pushing the boundaries of critic-free LLM reasoning.",

However, this effect emerges not only through interaction between people, limiting communication between groups, but also between narratives, shaping opinions and partisan identities. Yet, how polarised groups collectively construct and negotiate opposing interpretations of reality, and whether narratives move between groups despite limited interactions, remains unexplored. To address this gap, we formalise the concept of narrative polarisation and demonstrate its measurement in 212 YouTube videos and 90,029 comments on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Based on structural narrative theory and implemented through a large language model, we extract the narrative roles assigned to central actors in two partisan information environments. We find that while videos produce highly polarised narratives, comments significantly reduce narrative polarisation, harmonising discourse on the surface level. However, on a deeper narrative level, recurring narrative motifs reveal additional differences between partisan groups.",

    "summary": "The evaluation of navigation instructions remains a persistent challenge in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) research. Traditional reference-based metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the functional utility of spatial directives, specifically whether an instruction successfully guides a navigator to the intended destination. Although existing VLN agents could serve as evaluators, their reliance on high-fidelity visual simulators introduces licensing constraints and computational costs, and perception errors further confound linguistic quality assessment. This paper introduces GROKE(Graph-based Reasoning over OSM Knowledge for instruction Evaluation), a vision-free training-free hierarchical LLM-based framework for evaluating navigation instructions using OpenStreetMap data. Through systematic ablation studies, we demonstrate that structured JSON and textual formats for spatial information substantially outperform grid-based and visual graph representations. Our hierarchical architecture combines sub-instruction planning with topological graph navigation, reducing navigation error by 68.5% compared to heuristic and sampling baselines on the Map2Seq dataset. The agent's execution success, trajectory fidelity, and decision patterns serve as proxy metrics for functional navigability given OSM-visible landmarks and topology, establishing a scalable and interpretable evaluation paradigm without visual dependencies.

    "summary": "We consider the problem of distinguishing human-written creative fiction (excerpts from novels) from similar text generated by an LLM. Our results show that, while human observers perform poorly (near chance levels) on this binary classification task, a variety of machine-learning models achieve accuracy in the range 0.93 - 0.98 over a previously unseen test set, even using only short samples and single-token (unigram) features. We therefore employ an inherently interpretable (linear) classifier (with a test accuracy of 0.98), in order to elucidate the underlying reasons for this high accuracy. In our analysis, we identify specific unigram features indicative of LLM-generated text, one of the most important being that the LLM tends to use a larger variety of synonyms, thereby skewing the probability distributions in a manner that is easy to detect for a machine learning classifier, yet very difficult for a human observer. Four additional explanation categories were also identified, namely, temporal drift, Americanisms, foreign language usage, and colloquialisms. As identification of the AI-generated text depends on a constellation of such features, the classification appears robust, and therefore not easy to circumvent by malicious actors intent on misrepresenting AI-generated text as human work.",

    "summary": "Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel, has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens per decoding step.

Unlike systems requiring explicit decoding rules, MetaGlyph uses symbols like $\\in$ (membership) and $\\Rightarrow$ (implication) that models already understand from their training data. We test whether these symbols work as ''instruction shortcuts'' that models can interpret without additional teaching.\n  We evaluate eight models across two dimensions relevant to practitioners: scale (3B-1T parameters) and accessibility (open-source for local deployment vs. proprietary APIs). MetaGlyph achieves 62-81% token reduction across all task types. For API-based deployments, this translates directly to cost savings; for local deployments, it reduces latency and memory pressure.\n  Results vary by model. Gemini 2.5 Flash achieves 75% semantic equivalence between symbolic and prose instructions on selection tasks, with 49.9% membership operator fidelity. Kimi K2 reaches 98.1% fidelity for implication ($\\Rightarrow$) and achieves perfect (100%) accuracy on selection tasks with symbolic prompts. GPT-5.2 Chat shows the highest membership fidelity observed (91.3%), though with variable parse success across task types. Claude Haiku 4.5 achieves 100% parse success with 26% membership fidelity. Among mid-sized models, Qwen 2.5 7B shows 62% equivalence on extraction tasks.

    "title": "TALON: Confidence-Aware Speculative Decoding with Adaptive Token Trees",
    "summary": "Speculative decoding (SD) has become a standard technique for accelerating LLM inference without sacrificing output quality. Recent advances in speculative decoding have shifted from sequential chain-based drafting to tree-structured generation, where the draft model constructs a tree of candidate tokens to explore multiple possible drafts in parallel. However, existing tree-based SD methods typically build a fixed-width, fixed-depth draft tree, which fails to adapt to the varying difficulty of tokens and contexts. As a result, the draft model cannot dynamically adjust the tree structure to early stop on difficult tokens and extend generation for simple ones. To address these challenges, we introduce TALON, a training-free, budget-driven adaptive tree expansion framework that can be plugged into existing tree-based methods. Unlike static methods, TALON constructs the draft tree iteratively until a fixed token budget is met, using a hybrid expansion strategy that adaptively allocates the node budget to each layer of the draft tree. This framework naturally shapes the draft tree into a \"deep-and-narrow\" form for deterministic contexts and a \"shallow-and-wide\" form for uncertain branches, effectively optimizing the trade-off between exploration width and generation depth under a given budget. Extensive experiments across 5 models and 6 datasets demonstrate that TALON consistently outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE-3, achieving up to 5.16x end-to-end speedup over auto-regressive decoding.",

    "title": "Reward Modeling from Natural Language Human Feedback",
    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable reward (RLVR) on preference data has become the mainstream approach for training Generative Reward Models (GRMs). Typically in pairwise rewarding tasks, GRMs generate reasoning chains ending with critiques and preference labels, and RLVR then relies on the correctness of the preference labels as the training reward. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that such binary classification tasks make GRMs susceptible to guessing correct outcomes without sound critiques. Consequently, these spurious successes introduce substantial noise into the reward signal, thereby impairing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. To address this issue, we propose Reward Modeling from Natural Language Human Feedback (RM-NLHF), which leverages natural language feedback to obtain process reward signals, thereby mitigating the problem of limited solution space inherent in binary tasks. Specifically, we compute the similarity between GRM-generated and human critiques as the training reward, which provides more accurate reward signals than outcome-only supervision. Additionally, considering that human critiques are difficult to scale up, we introduce Meta Reward Model (MetaRM) which learns to predict process reward from datasets with human critiques and then generalizes to data without human critiques. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GRMs trained with outcome-only reward, confirming the superiority of integrating natural language over binary human feedback as supervision.",

    "summary": "The \"reversal curse\" refers to the phenomenon where large language models (LLMs) exhibit predominantly unidirectional behavior when processing logically bidirectional relationships. Prior work attributed this to autoregressive training -- predicting the next token inherently favors left-to-right information flow over genuine bidirectional knowledge associations. However, we observe that Diffusion LLMs (DLLMs), despite being trained bidirectionally, also suffer from the reversal curse. To investigate the root causes, we conduct systematic experiments on DLLMs and identify three key reasons: 1) entity fragmentation during training, 2) data asymmetry, and 3) missing entity relations. Motivated by the analysis of these reasons, we propose Diffusion Entity-Relation Modeling (DiffER), which addresses the reversal curse through entity-aware training and balanced data construction. Specifically, DiffER introduces whole-entity masking, which mitigates entity fragmentation by predicting complete entities in a single step. DiffER further employs distribution-symmetric and relation-enhanced data construction strategies to alleviate data asymmetry and missing relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffER effectively alleviates the reversal curse in Diffusion LLMs, offering new perspectives for future research.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Machine Translation (MT), applying them to linguistically complex domains-such as Social Network Services, literature etc. In these scenarios, translations often require handling non-literal expressions, leading to the inaccuracy of MT metrics. To systematically investigate the reliability of MT metrics, we first curate a meta-evaluation dataset focused on non-literal translations, namely MENT. MENT encompasses four non-literal translation domains and features source sentences paired with translations from diverse MT systems, with 7,530 human-annotated scores on translation quality. Experimental results reveal the inaccuracies of traditional MT metrics and the limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge, particularly the knowledge cutoff and score inconsistency problem. To mitigate these limitations, we propose RATE, a novel agentic translation evaluation framework, centered by a reflective Core Agent that dynamically invokes specialized sub-agents. Experimental results indicate the efficacy of RATE, achieving an improvement of at least 3.2 meta score compared with current metrics. Further experiments demonstrate the robustness of RATE to general-domain MT evaluation. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/BITHLP/RATE.",

    "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a pivotal paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current approaches struggle with visually rich documents by treating text and images as isolated retrieval targets. Existing methods relying solely on cosine similarity often fail to capture the semantic reinforcement provided by cross-modal alignment and layout-induced coherence. To address these limitations, we propose BayesRAG, a novel multimodal retrieval framework grounded in Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. Unlike traditional approaches that rank candidates strictly by similarity, BayesRAG models the intrinsic consistency of retrieved candidates across modalities as probabilistic evidence to refine retrieval confidence. Specifically, our method computes the posterior association probability for combinations of multimodal retrieval results, prioritizing text-image pairs that mutually corroborate each other in terms of both semantics and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BayesRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on challenging multimodal benchmarks. This study establishes a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval fusion that effectively resolves the isolation of heterogeneous modalities through an evidence fusion mechanism and enhances the robustness of retrieval outcomes.

    "summary": "This tutorial paper provides a step-by-step workflow for building and analysing semantic networks from short creative texts. We introduce and compare two widely used text-to-network approaches: word co-occurrence networks and textual forma mentis networks (TFMNs). We also demonstrate how they can be used in machine learning to predict human creativity ratings. Using a corpus of 1029 short stories, we guide readers through text preprocessing, network construction, feature extraction (structural measures, spreading-activation indices, and emotion scores), and application of regression models. We evaluate how network-construction choices influence both network topology and predictive performance. Across all modelling settings, TFMNs consistently outperformed co-occurrence networks through lower prediction errors (best MAE = 0.581 for TFMN, vs 0.592 for co-occurrence with window size 3). Network-structural features dominated predictive performance (MAE = 0.591 for TFMN), whereas emotion features performed worse (MAE = 0.711 for TFMN) and spreading-activation measures contributed little (MAE = 0.788 for TFMN). This paper offers practical guidance for researchers interested in applying network-based methods for cognitive fields like creativity research. we show when syntactic networks are preferable to surface co-occurrence models, and provide an open, reproducible workflow accessible to newcomers in the field, while also offering deeper methodological insight for experienced researchers.",

    "summary": "While machine translation is regarded as a \"solved problem\" for many high-resource languages, close analysis quickly reveals that this is not the case for content that shows challenges such as poetic language, philosophical concepts, multi-layered metaphorical expressions, and more. Sanskrit literature is a prime example of this, as it combines a large number of such challenges in addition to inherent linguistic features like sandhi, compounding, and heavy morphology, which further complicate NLP downstream tasks. It spans multiple millennia of text production time as well as a large breadth of different domains, ranging from ritual formulas via epic narratives, philosophical treatises, poetic verses up to scientific material. As of now, there is a strong lack of publicly available resources that cover these different domains and temporal layers of Sanskrit. We therefore introduce Mitrasamgraha, a high-quality Sanskrit-to-English machine translation dataset consisting of 391,548 bitext pairs, more than four times larger than the largest previously available Sanskrit dataset Itih=asa. It covers a time period of more than three millennia and a broad range of historical Sanskrit domains. In contrast to web-crawled datasets, the temporal and domain annotation of this dataset enables fine-grained study of domain and time period effects on MT performance. We also release a validation set consisting of 5,587 and a test set consisting of 5,552 post-corrected bitext pairs. We conduct experiments benchmarking commercial and open models on this dataset and fine-tune NLLB and Gemma models on the dataset, showing significant improvements, while still recognizing significant challenges in the translation of complex compounds, philosophical concepts, and multi-layered metaphors. We also analyze how in-context learning on this dataset impacts the performance of commercial models",

    "summary": "LLM-based client simulation has emerged as a promising tool for training novice counselors and evaluating automated counseling systems. However, existing client simulation approaches face three key challenges: (1) limited diversity and realism in client profiles, (2) the lack of a principled framework for modeling realistic client behaviors, and (3) a scarcity in Chinese-language settings. To address these limitations, we propose PsyCLIENT, a novel simulation framework grounded in conversational trajectory modeling. By conditioning LLM generation on predefined real-world trajectories that incorporate explicit behavior labels and content constraints, our approach ensures diverse and realistic interactions. We further introduce PsyCLIENT-CP, the first open-source Chinese client profile dataset, covering 60 distinct counseling topics. Comprehensive evaluations involving licensed professional counselors demonstrate that PsyCLIENT significantly outperforms baselines in terms of authenticity and training effectiveness. Notably, the simulated clients are nearly indistinguishable from human clients, achieving an about 95\\% expert confusion rate in discrimination tasks. These findings indicate that conversational trajectory modeling effectively bridges the gap between theoretical client profiles and dynamic, realistic simulations, offering a robust solution for mental health education and research. Code and data will be released to facilitate future research in mental health counseling.",

    "summary": "Cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) services often face challenges in achieving low inference latency and meeting Service Level Objectives (SLOs) under dynamic request patterns. Speculative decoding, which exploits lightweight models for drafting and LLMs for verification, has emerged as a compelling technique to accelerate LLM inference. However, existing speculative decoding solutions often fail to adapt to fluctuating workloads and dynamic system environments, resulting in impaired performance and SLO violations. In this paper, we introduce AdaSpec, an efficient LLM inference system that dynamically adjusts speculative strategies according to real-time request loads and system configurations. AdaSpec proposes a theoretical model to analyze and predict the efficiency of speculative strategies across diverse scenarios. Additionally, it implements intelligent drafting and verification algorithms to maximize performance while ensuring high SLO attainment. Experimental results on real-world LLM service traces demonstrate that AdaSpec consistently meets SLOs and achieves substantial performance improvements, delivering up to 66% speedup compared to state-of-the-art speculative inference systems.

    "summary": "Graph ``pre-training and prompt-tuning'' aligns downstream tasks with pre-trained objectives to enable efficient knowledge transfer under limited supervision. However, current methods typically rely on single-filter backbones (e.g., low-pass), whereas real-world graphs exhibit inherent spectral diversity. Our theoretical \\textit{Spectral Specificity} principle reveals that effective knowledge transfer requires alignment between pre-trained spectral filters and the intrinsic spectrum of downstream graphs. This identifies two fundamental limitations: (1) Knowledge Bottleneck: single-filter models suffer from irreversible information loss by suppressing signals from other frequency bands (e.g., high-frequency); (2) Utilization Bottleneck: spectral mismatches between pre-trained filters and downstream spectra lead to significant underutilization of pre-trained knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose HS-GPPT. We utilize a hybrid spectral backbone to construct an abundant knowledge basis. Crucially, we introduce Spectral-Aligned Prompt Tuning to actively align the downstream graph's spectrum with diverse pre-trained filters, facilitating comprehensive knowledge utilization across both homophily and heterophily. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness under both transductive and inductive learning settings.",

Existing approaches rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data for unseen labels, which poses challenges for low-resource languages like Malaysian English. These challenges include the incorporation of local linguistic nuances and the risk of factual inaccuracies in LLM-generated data. This paper introduces Document-Level Zero-Shot Relation Extraction with Entity Side Information (DocZSRE-SI) to address limitations in the existing DocZSRE approach. The DocZSRE-SI framework leverages Entity Side Information, such as Entity Mention Descriptions and Entity Mention Hypernyms, to perform ZSRE without depending on LLM-generated synthetic data. The proposed low-complexity model achieves an average improvement of 11.6% in the macro F1-Score compared to baseline models and existing benchmarks. By utilizing Entity Side Information, DocZSRE-SI offers a robust and efficient alternative to error-prone, LLM-based methods, demonstrating significant advancements in handling low-resource languages and linguistic diversity in relation extraction tasks. This research provides a scalable and reliable solution for ZSRE, particularly in contexts like Malaysian English news articles, where traditional LLM-based approaches fall short.",

While existing training-free approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version, SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further boost robustness. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time. Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.",

    "summary": "Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving to handle multi-turn tasks, but ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge. A fundamental pillar of this trustworthiness is calibration, which refers to an agent's ability to express confidence that reliably reflects its actual performance. While calibration is well-established for static models, its dynamics in tool-integrated agentic workflows remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate verbalized calibration in tool-use agents, revealing a fundamental confidence dichotomy driven by tool type. Specifically, our pilot study identifies that evidence tools (e.g., web search) systematically induce severe overconfidence due to inherent noise in retrieved information, while verification tools (e.g., code interpreters) can ground reasoning through deterministic feedback and mitigate miscalibration. To robustly improve calibration across tool types, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning framework that jointly optimizes task accuracy and calibration, supported by a holistic benchmark of reward designs. We demonstrate that our trained agents not only achieve superior calibration but also exhibit robust generalization from local training environments to noisy web settings and to distinct domains such as mathematical reasoning. Our results highlight the necessity of domain-specific calibration strategies for tool-use agents. More broadly, this work establishes a foundation for building self-aware agents that can reliably communicate uncertainty in high-stakes, real-world deployments.",

    "summary": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for Large Language Models (LLMs), but it still suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Recent work has shown that specialized LoRA initialization can alleviate catastrophic forgetting. There are currently two approaches to LoRA initialization aimed at preventing knowledge forgetting during fine-tuning: (1) making residual weights close to pre-trained weights, and (2) ensuring the space of LoRA initialization is orthogonal to pre-trained knowledge. The former is what current methods strive to achieve, while the importance of the latter is not sufficiently recognized. We find that the space of LoRA initialization is the key to preserving pre-trained knowledge rather than the residual weights. Existing methods like MiLoRA propose making the LoRA initialization space orthogonal to pre-trained weights. However, MiLoRA utilizes the null space of pre-trained weights. Compared to pre-trained weights, the input activations of pre-trained knowledge take into account the parameters of all previous layers as well as the input data, while pre-trained weights only contain information from the current layer. Moreover, we find that the effective ranks of input activations are much smaller than those of pre-trained weights. Thus, the null space of activations is more accurate and contains less pre-trained knowledge information compared to that of weights. Based on these, we introduce LoRA-Null, our proposed method that initializes LoRA in the null space of activations. Experimental results show that LoRA-Null effectively preserves the pre-trained world knowledge of LLMs while achieving good fine-tuning performance, as evidenced by extensive experiments.

    "summary": "Effectively analyzing online review data is essential across industries. However, many existing studies are limited to specific domains and languages or depend on supervised learning approaches that require large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a multilingual, scalable, and unsupervised framework for cross-domain aspect detection. This framework is designed for multi-aspect labeling of multilingual and multi-domain review data. In this study, we apply automatic labeling to Korean and English review datasets spanning various domains and assess the quality of the generated labels through extensive experiments. Aspect category candidates are first extracted through clustering, and each review is then represented as an aspect-aware embedding vector using negative sampling. To evaluate the framework, we conduct multi-aspect labeling and fine-tune several pretrained language models to measure the effectiveness of the automatically generated labels. Results show that these models achieve high performance, demonstrating that the labels are suitable for training. Furthermore, comparisons with publicly available large language models highlight the framework's superior consistency and scalability when processing large-scale data. A human evaluation also confirms that the quality of the automatic labels is comparable to those created manually. This study demonstrates the potential of a robust multi-aspect labeling approach that overcomes limitations of supervised methods and is adaptable to multilingual, multi-domain environments. Future research will explore automatic review summarization and the integration of artificial intelligence agents to further improve the efficiency and depth of review analysis.",

    "summary": "In multi-hop reasoning, multi-round retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically rely on LLM-generated content as the retrieval query. However, these approaches are inherently vulnerable to knowledge overshadowing - a phenomenon where critical information is overshadowed during generation. As a result, the LLM-generated content may be incomplete or inaccurate, leading to irrelevant retrieval and causing error accumulation during the iteration process. To address this challenge, we propose ActiShade, which detects and activates overshadowed knowledge to guide large language models (LLMs) in multi-hop reasoning. Specifically, ActiShade iteratively detects the overshadowed keyphrase in the given query, retrieves documents relevant to both the query and the overshadowed keyphrase, and generates a new query based on the retrieved documents to guide the next-round iteration. By supplementing the overshadowed knowledge during the formulation of next-round queries while minimizing the introduction of irrelevant noise, ActiShade reduces the error accumulation caused by knowledge overshadowing. Extensive experiments show that ActiShade outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets and LLMs.",

However, traditional RAG methods rely on fragment-level retrieval, limiting their ability to address query-focused summarization queries. GraphRAG introduces a graph-based paradigm for global knowledge reasoning, yet suffers from inefficiencies in information extraction, costly resource consumption, and poor adaptability to incremental updates. To overcome these limitations, we propose TagRAG, a tag-guided hierarchical knowledge graph RAG framework designed for efficient global reasoning and scalable graph maintenance. TagRAG introduces two key components: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction, which extracts object tags and their relationships from documents and organizes them into hierarchical domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation, and (2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which retrieves domain-centric tag chains to localize and synthesize relevant knowledge during inference. This design significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, and supports efficient knowledge increment. Extensive experiments on UltraDomain datasets spanning Agriculture, Computer Science, Law, and cross-domain settings demonstrate that TagRAG achieves an average winning rate of 78.36% against baselines while maintaining about 14.6x construction and 1.9x retrieval efficiency compared with GraphRAG.",

This survey examines why these gaps persist and whether they reflect intrinsic linguistic difficulty or modeling artifacts. We organize the literature around two questions: do linguistic disparities arise from representation and allocation choices (e.g., tokenization, encoding, data exposure, parameter sharing) rather than inherent complexity; and which design choices mitigate inequities across typologically diverse languages. We review linguistic features, such as orthography, morphology, lexical diversity, syntax, information density, and typological distance, linking each to concrete modeling mechanisms. Gaps often shrink when segmentation, encoding, and data exposure are normalized, suggesting much apparent difficulty stems from current modeling choices. We synthesize these insights into design recommendations for tokenization, sampling, architectures, and evaluation to support more balanced multilingual LMs.",

In this paper, we propose a mutual information based pruning method MI-PRUN for LLMs. Specifically, we leverages mutual information to identify redundant blocks by evaluating transitions in hidden states. Additionally, we incorporate the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) to reveal the relationship between the importance of entire contiguous blocks and that of individual blocks. Moreover, we develop the Fast-Block-Select algorithm, which iteratively updates block combinations to achieve a globally optimal solution while significantly improving the efficiency.

Extending GRPO to open-domain settings remains a critical challenge, as unconstrained generation entails multi-faceted and often conflicting objectives - such as creativity versus factuality - where rigid, static reward scalarization is inherently suboptimal. To address this, we propose MAESTRO (Meta-learning Adaptive Estimation of Scalarization Trade-offs for Reward Optimization), which introduces a meta-cognitive orchestration layer that treats reward scalarization as a dynamic latent policy, leveraging the model's terminal hidden states as a semantic bottleneck to perceive task-specific priorities. We formulate this as a contextual bandit problem within a bi-level optimization framework, where a lightweight Conductor network co-evolves with the policy by utilizing group-relative advantages as a meta-reward signal. Across seven benchmarks, MAESTRO consistently outperforms single-reward and static multi-objective baselines, while preserving the efficiency advantages of GRPO, and in some settings even reducing redundant generation.",

While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

    "summary": "Remote sensing change detection fundamentally relies on the effective fusion and discrimination of bi-temporal features. Prevailing paradigms typically utilize Siamese encoders bridged by explicit difference computation modules, such as subtraction or concatenation, to identify changes. In this work, we challenge this complexity with SEED (Siamese Encoder-Exchange-Decoder), a streamlined paradigm that replaces explicit differencing with parameter-free feature exchange. By sharing weights across both Siamese encoders and decoders, SEED effectively operates as a single parameter set model. Theoretically, we formalize feature exchange as an orthogonal permutation operator and prove that, under pixel consistency, this mechanism preserves mutual information and Bayes optimal risk, whereas common arithmetic fusion methods often introduce information loss. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, including SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, PX-CLCD, WaterCD, and CDD, and three backbones, namely SwinT, EfficientNet, and ResNet, demonstrate that SEED matches or surpasses state of the art methods despite its simplicity. Furthermore, we reveal that standard semantic segmentation models can be transformed into competitive change detectors solely by inserting this exchange mechanism, referred to as SEG2CD. The proposed paradigm offers a robust, unified, and interpretable framework for change detection, demonstrating that simple feature exchange is sufficient for high performance information fusion.

A single session using a 70-billion-parameter model can cost around $127 in cloud computing fees, which puts these tools out of reach for organizations operating on limited budgets. We present AgentCompress, a framework that tackles this problem through task-aware dynamic compression. The idea comes from a simple observation: not all tasks require the same computational effort. Complex reasoning, for example, is far more demanding than text reformatting, yet conventional compression applies the same reduction to both. Our approach uses a lightweight neural controller that looks at the first few tokens of each request, estimates how complex the task will be, and sends it to an appropriately quantized version of the model. This routing step adds only about 12 milliseconds of overhead. We tested the framework on 290 multi-stage workflows from domains including computer science, physics, chemistry, and biology. The results show a 68.3% reduction in computational costs while preserving 96.2% of the original success rate. These findings suggest that routing queries intelligently can make powerful language models substantially more affordable without sacrificing output quality",

This task is usually addressed with automated crater detection algorithms (CDA) based on deep learning techniques.

Therefore, we propose a deep-learning CDA based on the OWLv2 model, which is built on a Vision Transformer, that has proven highly effective in various computer vision tasks. For fine-tuning, we utilize a manually labeled dataset fom the IMPACT project, that provides crater annotations on high-resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Calibrated Data Record images. We insert trainable parameters using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy with Low-Rank Adaptation, and optimize a combined loss function consisting of Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) for localization and a contrastive loss for classification. We achieve satisfactory visual results, along with a maximum recall of 94.0% and a maximum precision of 73.1% on a test dataset from IMPACT.

    "title": "Beyond External Guidance: Unleashing the Semantic Richness Inside Diffusion Transformers for Improved Training",
    "summary": "Recent works such as REPA have shown that guiding diffusion models with external semantic features (e.g., DINO) can significantly accelerate the training of diffusion transformers (DiTs). However, this requires the use of pretrained external networks, introducing additional dependencies and reducing flexibility. In this work, we argue that DiTs actually have the power to guide the training of themselves, and propose \\textbf{Self-Transcendence}, a simple yet effective method that achieves fast convergence using internal feature supervision only. It is found that the slow convergence in DiT training primarily stems from the difficulty of representation learning in shallow layers. To address this, we initially train the DiT model by aligning its shallow features with the latent representations from the pretrained VAE for a short phase (e.g., 40 epochs), then apply classifier-free guidance to the intermediate features, enhancing their discriminative capability and semantic expressiveness. These enriched internal features, learned entirely within the model, are used as supervision signals to guide a new DiT training. Compared to existing self-contained methods, our approach brings a significant performance boost. It can even surpass REPA in terms of generation quality and convergence speed, but without the need for any external pretrained models. Our method is not only more flexible for different backbones but also has the potential to be adopted for a wider range of diffusion-based generative tasks. The source code of our method can be found at https://github.com/csslc/Self-Transcendence.",

    "summary": "We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K (zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The code will be released here.",

    "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) face a fundamental dilemma in video reasoning: they are caught between the prohibitive computational costs of verbose reasoning and the hallucination risks of efficient, ungrounded approaches. To resolve this, we introduce the Chain of Evidence (CoE), a novel framework that architecturally decouples and co-optimizes perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency. CoE incorporates two core innovations: (1) A lightweight Evidence Grounding Module (EGM) that acts as a query-guided filter, dynamically identifying and extracting a compact set of high-fidelity visual evidence; and (2) An Evidence-Anchoring Protocol optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Crucially, we design a composite reward mechanism that enforces process alignment, compelling the model to strictly reference identified temporal anchors during deduction, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To enable this, we construct CoE-Instruct, a large-scale dataset (164k samples) featuring a novel dual-annotation schema for separate perception and reasoning supervision. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, demonstrate that CoE-enhanced models establish a new state-of-the-art. They significantly outperform existing methods in accuracy, proving CoE to be a powerful and practical paradigm for reliable video understanding.",

The images are rendered using a physically based ray tracing code that has been specifically developed to use the standard calibration coefficients of any camera directly. The software reproduces image distortions, defocus and diffraction blur. Furthermore, sub-pixel sampling is applied to sharp edges to enhance the fidelity of the rendered image. After introducing the rendering algorithm and its experimental validation, the paper proposes a method for evaluating the pose accuracy. This method is applied to well-known markers, revealing their strengths and weaknesses for pose estimation. The code is open source and available on GitHub.",

However, not every function can be well approximated by a monotone neural network. We demonstrate that monotonicity can still be used in two ways to boost explainability. First, we use an adaptation of the decomposition of a trained ReLU network into two monotone and convex parts, thereby overcoming numerical obstacles from an inherent blowup of the weights in this procedure. Our proposed saliency methods -- SplitCAM and SplitLRP -- improve on state of the art results on both VGG16 and Resnet18 networks on ImageNet-S across all Quantus saliency metric categories. Second, we exhibit that training a model as the difference between two monotone neural networks results in a system with strong self-explainability properties.",

    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a critical bottleneck in achieving precise numerical prediction for 3D scene understanding. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, primarily based on relative ranking, often suffer from severe reward sparsity and gradient instability, failing to effectively exploit the verifiable signals provided by 3D physical constraints. Notably, in standard GRPO frameworks, relative normalization causes \"near-miss\" samples (characterized by small but non-zero errors) to suffer from advantage collapse. This leads to a severe data utilization bottleneck where valuable boundary samples are discarded during optimization. To address this, we introduce the Smooth Numerical Reward Activation (SNRA) operator and the Absolute-Preserving GRPO (AP-GRPO) framework. SNRA employs a dynamically parameterized Sigmoid function to transform raw feedback into a dense, continuous reward continuum. Concurrently, AP-GRPO integrates absolute scalar gradients to mitigate the numerical information loss inherent in conventional relative-ranking mechanisms. By leveraging this approach, we constructed Numerical3D-50k, a dataset comprising 50,000 verifiable 3D subtasks. Empirical results indicate that AP-GRPO achieves performance parity with large-scale supervised methods while maintaining higher data efficiency, effectively activating latent 3D reasoning in VLMs without requiring architectural modifications.",

By integrating our mixture model into a pre-trained state-of-the-art 3D model, we achieve a substantial reduction of boundary artifacts and gains in overall reconstruction accuracy.

While recent studies use synthetic images to improve License Plate Recognition (LPR) results, there remain several limitations in these efforts.

We subject 16 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models to a benchmarking process involving 12 public datasets acquired from various regions. Several key findings emerge from our investigation. Primarily, the massive incorporation of synthetic data substantially boosts model performance in both intra- and cross-dataset scenarios. We examine three distinct methodologies for generating synthetic data: template-based generation, character permutation, and utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, each contributing significantly to performance enhancement. The combined use of these methodologies demonstrates a notable synergistic effect, leading to end-to-end results that surpass those reached by state-of-the-art methods and established commercial systems. Our experiments also underscore the efficacy of synthetic data in mitigating challenges posed by limited training data, enabling remarkable results to be achieved even with small fractions of the original training data. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and speed among different models, identifying those that strike the optimal balance in each intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings.",

    "summary": "Deep image watermarking, which refers to enabling imperceptible watermark embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has been shown to be effective for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for generalizable watermarking: (1) invisibility (imperceptible hiding of watermarks), (2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and (3) broad applicability (low latency in the watermarking process). To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL) framework, a two-stage optimization that enables a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve all three criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to establish a common latent space with two constraints: (1) visual consistency between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and (2) information invariance across watermark latent representations. In this way, multimodal inputs -- including watermark messages (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) -- can be effectively represented, ensuring both the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in the watermarking process. In the second stage, we employ generalized watermark representation learning to separate a unique representation of the watermark from the marked image in RGB space. Once trained, the HiWL model effectively learns generalizable watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, it achieves 7.6% higher accuracy in watermark extraction compared to existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (processing 1000 images in 1 second).",

To achieve production-level fidelity, we introduce a novel semantic surface extraction formalism compatible with hybrid implicit fields. This mechanism is accelerated by a coarse-to-fine proposal scheme, which significantly reduces memory footprint and enables high-resolution mesh generation. Furthermore, we propose a video-diffusion-based texture decomposition module that disentangles appearance into editable layers (e.g., separated iris and skin), resolving semantic confusion in facial regions. Experiments demonstrate that StdGEN++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in geometric accuracy and semantic disentanglement. Crucially, the resulting structural independence unlocks advanced downstream capabilities, including non-destructive editing, physics-compliant animation, and gaze tracking, making it a robust solution for automated character asset production.",

Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail.\n  In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\\% of the original model size.

    "summary": "Document layout analysis aims to detect and categorize structural elements (e.g., titles, tables, figures) in scanned or digital documents. Popular methods often rely on high-quality Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to merge visual features with extracted text. This dependency introduces two major drawbacks: propagation of text recognition errors and substantial computational overhead, limiting the robustness and practical applicability of multimodal approaches. In contrast to the prevailing multimodal trend, we argue that effective layout analysis depends not on text-visual fusion, but on a deep understanding of documents' intrinsic visual structure. To this end, we propose PARL (Position-Aware Relation Learning Network), a novel OCR-free, vision-only framework that models layout through positional sensitivity and relational structure. Specifically, we first introduce a Bidirectional Spatial Position-Guided Deformable Attention module to embed explicit positional dependencies among layout elements directly into visual features. Second, we design a Graph Refinement Classifier (GRC) to refine predictions by modeling contextual relationships through a dynamically constructed layout graph. Extensive experiments show PARL achieves state-of-the-art results. It establishes a new benchmark for vision-only methods on DocLayNet and, notably, surpasses even strong multimodal models on M6Doc. Crucially, PARL (65M) is highly efficient, using roughly four times fewer parameters than large multimodal models (256M), demonstrating that sophisticated visual structure modeling can be both more efficient and robust than multimodal fusion.",

Such correspondence estimation allows us to reproject each valid pixel color from screen space to UV space, which is independent of camera pose and character expression. Furthermore, we design learnable UV tokens on which the attention mechanism can be applied at both the screen and UV levels. The learned UV tokens can be decoded into canonical Gaussian attributes using aggregated UV information from all input views. To train our large avatar model, we additionally prepare a large-scale, identity-rich synthetic training dataset. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both monocular and multi-view settings. Project page: https://zijian-wu.github.io/uika-page/",

    "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting has recently gained traction for its efficient training and real-time rendering. While the vanilla Gaussian Splatting representation is mainly designed for view synthesis, more recent works investigated how to extend it with scene understanding and language features. However, existing methods lack a detailed comprehension of scenes, limiting their ability to segment and interpret complex structures. To this end, We introduce SuperGSeg, a novel approach that fosters cohesive, context-aware scene representation by disentangling segmentation and language field distillation. SuperGSeg first employs neural Gaussians to learn instance and hierarchical segmentation features from multi-view images with the aid of off-the-shelf 2D masks. These features are then leveraged to create a sparse set of what we call Super-Gaussians. Super-Gaussians facilitate the distillation of 2D language features into 3D space. Through Super-Gaussians, our method enables high-dimensional language feature rendering without extreme increases in GPU memory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGSeg outperforms prior works on both open-vocabulary object localization and semantic segmentation tasks.",

We developed a foundation model-based AI pipeline for patient-level classification and lesion-level detection of CRLM on contrast-enhanced CT, integrating uncertainty quantification and explainability. CT data from the EuCanImage consortium (n=2437) and an external TCIA cohort (n=197) were used. Among several pretrained models, UMedPT achieved the best performance and was fine-tuned with an MLP head for classification and an FCOS-based head for lesion detection. The classification model achieved an AUC of 0.90 and a sensitivity of 0.82 on the combined test set, with a sensitivity of 0.85 on the external cohort. Excluding the most uncertain 20 percent of cases improved AUC to 0.91 and balanced accuracy to 0.86. Decision curve analysis showed clinical benefit for threshold probabilities between 0.30 and 0.40. The detection model identified 69.1 percent of lesions overall, increasing from 30 percent to 98 percent across lesion size quartiles. Grad-CAM highlighted lesion-corresponding regions in high-confidence cases. These results demonstrate that foundation model-based pipelines can support robust and interpretable CRLM detection and classification across heterogeneous CT data.",

However, current methods suffer from limited multi-view data and poor generalization to new viewpoints. We introduce BenchSeg, a novel multi-view food video segmentation dataset and benchmark.

We evaluate a diverse set of 20 state-of-the-art segmentation models (e.g., SAM-based, transformer, CNN, and large multimodal) on the existing FoodSeg103 dataset and evaluate them (alone and combined with video-memory modules) on BenchSeg. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that while standard image segmenters degrade sharply under novel viewpoints, memory-augmented methods maintain temporal consistency across frames. Our best model based on a combination of SeTR-MLA+XMem2 outperforms prior work (e.g., improving over FoodMem by ~2.63% mAP), offering new insights into food segmentation and tracking for dietary analysis.

To effectively develop and evaluate perception stacks and planning algorithms, realistic closed-loop simulators are indispensable. While 3D reconstruction techniques such as Gaussian Splatting offer promising avenues for simulator construction, the rendered novel views often exhibit artifacts, particularly in extrapolated perspectives or when available observations are sparse.\n  We introduce ViewMorpher3D, a multi-view image enhancement framework based on image diffusion models, designed to elevate photorealism and multi-view coherence in driving scenes. Unlike single-view approaches, ViewMorpher3D jointly processes a set of rendered views conditioned on camera poses, 3D geometric priors, and temporally adjacent or spatially overlapping reference views. This enables the model to infer missing details, suppress rendering artifacts, and enforce cross-view consistency.\n  Our framework accommodates variable numbers of cameras and flexible reference/target view configurations, making it adaptable to diverse sensor setups. Experiments on real-world driving datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in image quality metrics, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving geometric fidelity.",

    "summary": "Diffusion Transformer (DiT), an emerging diffusion model for visual generation, has demonstrated superior performance but suffers from substantial computational costs. Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions. Building on these designs, we present an extended version, DyDiT++, with improvements in three key aspects. First, it extends the generation mechanism of DyDiT beyond diffusion to flow matching, demonstrating that our method can also accelerate flow-matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT++. Remarkably, with <3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our approach reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, yielding 1.73x realistic speedup on hardware, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet.

Yet their potential for slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), the task of jointly estimating 3D anatomy and slice poses from misaligned 2D acquisitions, remains underexplored. We introduce a fast convolutional framework that fuses multiple orthogonal 2D slice stacks to recover coherent 3D structure and refines slice alignment through lightweight model-based optimization. Applied to fetal brain MRI, our approach reconstructs high-quality 3D volumes in under 10s, with 1s slice registration and accuracy on par with state-of-the-art iterative SVR pipelines, offering more than speedup. The framework uses non-rigid displacement fields to represent transformations, generalizing to other SVR problems like fetal body and placental MRI. Additionally, the fast inference time paves the way for real-time, scanner-side volumetric feedback during MRI acquisition.",

    "summary": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering (MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Adversarial attacks in computer vision can be categorized into digital attacks and physical attacks based on their different forms. Compared to digital attacks, which generate perturbations in digital pixels, physical attacks are more practical in real-world settings. Due to the serious security risks posed by physically adversarial examples, many studies have been conducted to evaluate the physically adversarial robustness of DNNs in recent years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of current physically adversarial attacks and defenses in computer vision. We establish a taxonomy by organizing physical attacks according to attack tasks, attack forms, and attack methods. This approach offers readers a systematic understanding of the topic from multiple perspectives. For physical defenses, we categorize them into pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing for DNN models to ensure comprehensive coverage of adversarial defenses. Based on this survey, we discuss the challenges facing this research field and provide an outlook on future directions.",

    "summary": "Accurate three-dimensional (3D) tooth segmentation from Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a prerequisite for digital dental workflows. However, achieving high-fidelity segmentation remains challenging due to adhesion artifacts in naturally occluded scans, which are caused by low contrast and indistinct inter-arch boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose the Anatomy Aware Cascade Network (AACNet), a coarse-to-fine framework designed to resolve boundary ambiguity while maintaining global structural consistency. Specifically, we introduce two mechanisms: the Ambiguity Gated Boundary Refiner (AGBR) and the Signed Distance Map guided Anatomical Attention (SDMAA). The AGBR employs an entropy based gating mechanism to perform targeted feature rectification in high uncertainty transition zones. Meanwhile, the SDMAA integrates implicit geometric constraints via signed distance map to enforce topological consistency, preventing the loss of spatial details associated with standard pooling. Experimental results on a dataset of 125 CBCT volumes demonstrate that AACNet achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 90.17 \\% and a 95\\% Hausdorff Distance of 3.63 mm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalization on an external dataset with an HD95 of 2.19 mm, validating its reliability for downstream clinical applications such as surgical planning.

Most existing methods rely on uniform supervision, implicitly assuming a constant difficulty distribution across layout regions. In this work, we challenge this assumption by revealing a critical flaw: \\textbf{Positional Disparity}, a phenomenon where models demonstrate mastery over the deterministic start and end regions but suffer a performance collapse in the complex intermediate sections. This degradation arises because standard training allows the massive volume of easy patterns to drown out the learning signals from difficult layouts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{FocalOrder}, a framework driven by \\textbf{Focal Preference Optimization (FPO)}. Specifically, FocalOrder employs adaptive difficulty discovery with exponential moving average mechanism to dynamically pinpoint hard-to-learn transitions, while introducing a difficulty-calibrated pairwise ranking objective to enforce global logical consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FocalOrder establishes new state-of-the-art results on OmniDocBench v1.0 and Comp-HRDoc.

    "summary": "Diffusion Transformers achieve impressive generative quality but remain computationally expensive due to iterative sampling. Recently, dynamic resolution sampling has emerged as a promising acceleration technique by reducing the resolution of early sampling steps. However, existing methods rely on heuristic re-noising at every resolution transition, injecting noise that breaks cross-stage consistency and forces the model to relearn global structure. In addition, these methods indiscriminately upsample the entire latent space at once without checking which regions have actually converged, causing accumulated errors, and visible artifacts. Therefore, we propose \\textbf{Fresco}, a dynamic resolution framework that unifies re-noise and global structure across stages with progressive upsampling, preserving both the efficiency of low-resolution drafting and the fidelity of high-resolution refinement, with all stages aligned toward the same final target. Fresco achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 10$\\times$ speedup on FLUX, and 5$\\times$ on HunyuanVideo, while remaining orthogonal to distillation, quantization and feature caching, reaching 22$\\times$ speedup when combined with distilled models.

    "summary": "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models enhance understanding and interaction with audiovisual content, making it more accessible, searchable, and useful for a wide range of fields such as education, surveillance, entertainment, and content creation. Due to heavy compute requirements, most large visual language models (VLMs) for VideoQA rely on a fixed number of frames by uniformly sampling the video. However, this process does not pick important frames or capture the context of the video. We present a novel query-based selection of frames relevant to the questions based on the submodular mutual Information (SMI) functions. By replacing uniform frame sampling with query-based selection, our method ensures that the chosen frames provide complementary and essential visual information for accurate VideoQA. We evaluate our approach on the MVBench dataset, which spans a diverse set of multi-action video tasks. VideoQA accuracy on this dataset was assessed using two VLMs, namely Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, both of which originally employed uniform frame sampling. Experiments were conducted using both uniform and query-based sampling strategies. An accuracy improvement of up to \\textbf{4\\%} was observed when using query-based frame selection over uniform sampling. Qualitative analysis further highlights that query-based selection, using SMI functions, consistently picks frames better aligned with the question. We opine that such query-based frame selection can enhance accuracy in a wide range of tasks that rely on only a subset of video frames.",

    "title": "Smooth regularization for efficient video recognition",
    "summary": "We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

    "summary": "Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions. Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly 70% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.",

The framework integrates modern deep-learning models for page-level illustration detection, illustration extraction, and multimodal description, enabling scholars to search, cluster, and study visual materials and artistic trends across entire corpora. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on large heterogeneous collections, including the Vatican Library and richly illuminated manuscripts such as the Bible of Borso d'Este. The system reveals meaningful visual patterns and cross-manuscript relationships by embedding illustrations into a shared representation space and analyzing their similarity structure (see figure 4). By harnessing recent advances in computer vision and vision-language models, our framework enables new forms of large-scale visual scholarship in historical studies, art history, and cultural heritage making it possible to explore iconography, stylistic trends, and cultural connections in ways that were previously impractical.",

We propose a unified framework that predicts volumetric and surface metrics directly from a set of 2D multi-view images. Our approach first generates a point cloud from the captured multi-view images using recent 3D reconstruction techniques, while a parallel 2D encoder aggregates view-aligned features. A fusion module then aligns and merges 3D geometry with 2D visual embeddings, followed by a graph-based decoder that regresses volume, surface area, and their corresponding uncertainties. This proposed architecture maintains robustness against sparse or noisy data. We evaluate the framework across multiple application domains: corals, where precise geometric measurements support growth monitoring; food items, where volume prediction relates to dietary tracking and portion analysis; and human bodies, where volumetric cues are crucial for anthropometric and medical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the reliable performance of our framework across diverse scenarios, highlighting its versatility and adaptability.

Traditional deep learning models often suffer from overfitting and high computational costs.

In this work, we explore the application of SD to HSI by treating earlier outputs as soft targets, thereby enforcing consistency between intermediate and final predictions. This process improves intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in the learned feature space.

    "summary": "Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models have achieved unprecedented quality in image and video generation, yet their iterative sampling process remains computationally prohibitive. To accelerate inference, feature caching methods have emerged by reusing intermediate representations across timesteps. However, existing caching approaches treat all feature components uniformly. We reveal that DiT feature spaces contain distinct principal and residual subspaces with divergent temporal behavior: the principal subspace evolves smoothly and predictably, while the residual subspace exhibits volatile, low-energy oscillations that resist accurate prediction. Building on this insight, we propose SVD-Cache, a subspace-aware caching framework that decomposes diffusion features via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), applies exponential moving average (EMA) prediction to the dominant low-rank components, and directly reuses the residual subspace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SVD-Cache achieves near-lossless across diverse models and methods, including 5.55$\\times$ speedup on FLUX and HunyuanVideo, and compatibility with model acceleration techniques including distillation, quantization and sparse attention.

Compared to the emerging 3D representation technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the spatially sparse point cloud cannot depict the texture information of 3D objects, resulting in inferior reconstruction capabilities. This limitation constrains the potential of point cloud-based 3D multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we present CLIP-GS, a novel multimodal representation learning framework grounded in 3DGS. We introduce the GS Tokenizer to generate serialized gaussian tokens, which are then processed through transformer layers pre-initialized with weights from point cloud models, resulting in the 3DGS embeddings. CLIP-GS leverages contrastive loss between 3DGS and the visual-text embeddings of CLIP, and we introduce an image voting loss to guide the directionality and convergence of gradient optimization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient way to generate triplets of 3DGS, images, and text, facilitating CLIP-GS in learning unified multimodal representations. Leveraging the well-aligned multimodal representations, CLIP-GS demonstrates versatility and outperforms point cloud-based models on various 3D tasks, including multimodal retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification.",

We introduce the E-commerce Hierarchical Video Captioning (E-HVC) dataset with dual-granularity, temporally grounded annotations: a Temporal Chain-of-Thought that anchors event-level observations and Chapter Summary that compose them into concise, story-centric summaries. Rather than directly prompting chapters, we adopt a staged construction that first gathers reliable linguistic and visual evidence via curated ASR and frame-level descriptions, then refines coarse annotations into precise chapter boundaries and titles conditioned on the Temporal Chain-of-Thought, yielding fact-grounded, time-aligned narratives. We also observe that e-commerce videos are fast-paced and information-dense, with visual tokens dominating the input sequence. To enable efficient training while reducing input tokens, we propose the Scene-Primed ASR-anchored Compressor (SPA-Compressor), which compresses multimodal tokens into hierarchical scene and event representations guided by ASR semantic cues. Built upon these designs, our HiVid-Narrator framework achieves superior narrative quality with fewer input tokens compared to existing methods.",

Trained solely on low-resolution images ($\\leq$ 256px), FlexVAR can: (1) Generate images of various resolutions and aspect ratios, even exceeding the resolution of the training images. (2) Support various image-to-image tasks, including image refinement, in/out-painting, and image expansion. (3) Adapt to various autoregressive steps, allowing for faster inference with fewer steps or enhancing image quality with more steps.

To support the needs of ever-changing object sets in such context, modern zero-shot object pose estimators were developed to not require object-specific training but only rely on CAD models. Such models are hard to obtain once deployed, and a continuously changing and growing set of objects makes it harder to reliably identify the instance model of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce an Open-Set CAD Retrieval from a Language Prompt and a Single Image (OSCAR), a novel training-free method that retrieves a matching object model from an unlabeled 3D object database. During onboarding, OSCAR generates multi-view renderings of database models and annotates them with descriptive captions using an image captioning model. At inference, GroundedSAM detects the queried object in the input image, and multi-modal embeddings are computed for both the Region-of-Interest and the database captions. OSCAR employs a two-stage retrieval: text-based filtering using CLIP identifies candidate models, followed by image-based refinement using DINOv2 to select the most visually similar object. In our experiments we demonstrate that OSCAR outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the cross-domain 3D model retrieval benchmark MI3DOR. Furthermore, we demonstrate OSCAR's direct applicability in automating object model sourcing for 6D object pose estimation. We propose using the most similar object model for pose estimation if the exact instance is not available and show that OSCAR achieves an average precision of 90.48\\% during object retrieval on the YCB-V object dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most similar object model can be utilized for pose estimation using Megapose achieving better results than a reconstruction-based approach.",

Across two vision and nine medical datasets, we uncover a \"data scale-method-performance\" coupling law: (1) in few-shot tasks, the \"Channel-Multi-scale Spatial\" cascaded structure achieves optimal performance; (2) in medium-scale tasks, parallel learnable fusion architectures demonstrate superior results; (3) in large-scale tasks, parallel structures with dynamic gating yield the best performance. Additionally, experiments indicate that the \"Spatial-Channel\" order is more stable and effective for fine-grained classification, while residual connections mitigate vanishing gradient problems across varying data scales. We thus propose scenario-based guidelines for building future attention modules. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DWlzm.",

    "summary": "Semi-supervised remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of exhaustive annotation, yet it fundamentally struggles with pseudo-label drift, a phenomenon where confirmation bias leads to the accumulation of errors during training. In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose the Cognition-Inspired Meta-Action Framework (CINEMA), a novel approach that decomposes multi-image reasoning into five structured meta-actions: Global, Focus, Hint, Think, and Answer which explicitly modeling the sequential cognitive steps humans naturally employ. For cold-start training, we introduce a Retrieval-Based Tree Sampling strategy that generates high-quality meta-action trajectories to bootstrap the model with reasoning patterns. During reinforcement learning, we adopt a two-stage paradigm: an exploration phase with Diversity-Preserving Strategy to avoid entropy collapse, followed by an annealed exploitation phase with DAPO to gradually strengthen exploitation. To train our model, we construct a dataset of 57k cold-start and 58k reinforcement learning instances spanning multi-image, multi-frame, and single-image tasks. We conduct extensive evaluations on multi-image reasoning benchmarks, video understanding benchmarks, and single-image benchmarks, achieving competitive state-of-the-art performance on several key benchmarks. Our model surpasses GPT-4o on the MUIR and MVMath benchmarks and notably outperforms specialized video reasoning models on video understanding benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our human cognition-inspired reasoning framework.",

    "summary": "While inference-time scaling has significantly enhanced generative quality in large language and diffusion models, its application to vector-quantized (VQ) visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) remains unexplored. We introduce VAR-Scaling, the first general framework for inference-time scaling in VAR, addressing the critical challenge of discrete latent spaces that prohibit continuous path search. We find that VAR scales exhibit two distinct pattern types: general patterns and specific patterns, where later-stage specific patterns conditionally optimize early-stage general patterns. To overcome the discrete latent space barrier in VQ models, we map sampling spaces to quasi-continuous feature spaces via kernel density estimation (KDE), where high-density samples approximate stable, high-quality solutions. This transformation enables effective navigation of sampling distributions. We propose a density-adaptive hybrid sampling strategy: Top-k sampling focuses on high-density regions to preserve quality near distribution modes, while Random-k sampling explores low-density areas to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence. Consequently, VAR-Scaling optimizes sample fidelity at critical scales to enhance output quality. Experiments in class-conditional and text-to-image evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in inference process. The code is available at https://github.com/WD7ang/VAR-Scaling.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in few-step diffusion models have demonstrated their efficiency and effectiveness by shortcutting the probabilistic paths of diffusion models, especially in training one-step diffusion models from scratch (\\emph{a.k.a.} shortcut models). However, their theoretical derivation and practical implementation are often closely coupled, which obscures the design space. To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting with one step generation, and further reaches FID50k of 2.53 with 2x training steps. Remarkably, the model requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. We believe our work lowers the barrier to component-level innovation in shortcut models and facilitates principled exploration of their design space.",

    "title": "Focal Guidance: Unlocking Controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers in Video Diffusion Models",
    "summary": "The task of Image-to-Video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize a video from a reference image and a text prompt. This requires diffusion models to reconcile high-frequency visual constraints and low-frequency textual guidance during the denoising process. However, while existing I2V models prioritize visual consistency, how to effectively couple this dual guidance to ensure strong adherence to the text prompt remains underexplored. In this work, we observe that in Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based I2V models, certain intermediate layers exhibit weak semantic responses (termed Semantic-Weak Layers), as indicated by a measurable drop in text-visual similarity. We attribute this to a phenomenon called Condition Isolation, where attention to visual features becomes partially detached from text guidance and overly relies on learned visual priors. To address this, we propose Focal Guidance (FG), which enhances the controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers. FG comprises two mechanisms: (1) Fine-grained Semantic Guidance (FSG) leverages CLIP to identify key regions in the reference frame and uses them as anchors to guide Semantic-Weak Layers. (2) Attention Cache transfers attention maps from semantically responsive layers to Semantic-Weak Layers, injecting explicit semantic signals and alleviating their over-reliance on the model's learned visual priors, thereby enhancing adherence to textual instructions. To further validate our approach and address the lack of evaluation in this direction, we introduce a benchmark for assessing instruction following in I2V models. On this benchmark, Focal Guidance proves its effectiveness and generalizability, raising the total score on Wan2.1-I2V to 0.7250 (+3.97\\%) and boosting the MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V to 0.5571 (+7.44\\%).",

    "summary": "IMPORTANCE: Modern ultrasound systems are universal diagnostic tools capable of imaging the entire body. However, current AI solutions remain fragmented into single-task tools. This critical gap between hardware versatility and software specificity limits workflow integration and clinical utility.\n  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, versatility, and efficiency of single general-purpose deep learning models for multi-organ classification and segmentation.\n  DESIGN: The Universal UltraSound Image Challenge 2025 (UUSIC25) involved developing algorithms on 11,644 images aggregated from 12 sources (9 public, 3 private). Evaluation used an independent, multi-center private test set of 2,479 images, including data from a center completely unseen during training to assess generalization.\n  OUTCOMES: Diagnostic performance (Dice Similarity Coefficient [DSC]; Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve [AUC]) and computational efficiency (inference time, GPU memory).\n  RESULTS: Of 15 valid algorithms, the top model (SMART) achieved a macro-averaged DSC of 0.854 across 5 segmentation tasks and AUC of 0.766 for binary classification. Models demonstrated high capability in anatomical segmentation (e.g., fetal head DSC: 0.942) but variability in complex diagnostic tasks subject to domain shift. Specifically, in breast cancer molecular subtyping, the top model's performance dropped from an AUC of 0.571 (internal) to 0.508 (unseen external center), highlighting the challenge of generalization.\n  CONCLUSIONS: General-purpose AI models can achieve high accuracy and efficiency across multiple tasks using a single architecture. However, significant performance degradation on unseen data suggests domain generalization is critical for future clinical deployment.",

Our method transfers motion to target skeletons by leveraging these skeleton-agnostic representations alongside target-specific structural information. To ensure robust learning and preserve motion fidelity, we introduce a cycle consistency mechanism that maintains semantic coherence throughout the retargeting process. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in handling diverse skeletal structures while maintaining motion realism and semantic fidelity, even when generalizing to previously unseen skeleton-motion combinations.

    "summary": "Data-driven landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) typically relies on landslide conditioning factors (LCFs), whose availability, heterogeneity, and preprocessing-related uncertainties can constrain mapping reliability. Recently, Google AlphaEarth (AE) embeddings, derived from multi-source geospatial observations, have emerged as a unified representation of Earth surface conditions. This study evaluated the potential of AE embeddings as alternative predictors for LSM. Two AE representations, including retained principal components and the full set of 64 embedding bands, were systematically compared with conventional LCFs across three study areas (Nantou County, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and part of Emilia-Romagna, Italy) using three deep learning models (CNN1D, CNN2D, and Vision Transformer). Performance was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, ROC-AUC analysis, error statistics, and spatial pattern assessment. Results showed that AE-based models consistently outperformed LCFs across all regions and models, yielding higher F1-scores, AUC values, and more stable error distributions. Such improvement was most pronounced when using the full 64-band AE representation, with F1-score improvements of approximately 4% to 15% and AUC increased ranging from 0.04 to 0.11, depending on the study area and model. AE-based susceptibility maps also exhibited clearer spatial correspondence with observed landslide occurrences and enhanced sensitivity to localised landslide-prone conditions. Performance improvements were more evident in Nantou and Emilia than in Hong Kong, revealing that closer temporal alignment between AE embeddings and landslide inventories may lead to more effective LSM outcomes. These findings highlight the strong potential of AE embeddings as a standardised and information-rich alternative to conventional LCFs for LSM.",

Adversarial purification offers a promising solution by removing adversarial noise from contaminated data. However, existing purification methods are primarily designed for classification tasks and fail to address SD-specific adversarial strategies, such as attacks targeting the VAE encoder, UNet denoiser, or both. To address the gap in SD security, we propose Universal Diffusion Adversarial Purification (UDAP), a novel framework tailored for defending adversarial attacks targeting SD models. UDAP leverages the distinct reconstruction behaviors of clean and adversarial images during Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to optimize the purification process. By minimizing the DDIM metric loss, UDAP can effectively remove adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic epoch adjustment strategy that adapts optimization iterations based on reconstruction errors, significantly improving efficiency without sacrificing purification quality. Experiments demonstrate UDAP's robustness against diverse adversarial methods, including PID (VAE-targeted), Anti-DreamBooth (UNet-targeted), MIST (hybrid), and robustness-enhanced variants like Anti-Diffusion (Anti-DF) and MetaCloak. UDAP also generalizes well across SD versions and text prompts, showcasing its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.",

This allows our framework to more reliably identify unexplored or poorly reconstructed regions compared to existing methods, leading to more informed and targeted exploration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical exploration strategy that leverages learned epistemic uncertainty, where local planning extracts target viewpoints from high-uncertainty voxels based on visibility for trajectory generation, and global planning uses uncertainty to guide large-scale coverage for efficient and comprehensive reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed method in active 3D reconstruction is demonstrated by achieving higher reconstruction completeness compared to previous approaches on photorealistic simulated scenes across varying scales, while a hardware demonstration further validates its real-world applicability.",

For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.",

    "summary": "State-of-the-art text-based image editing models often struggle to balance background preservation with semantic consistency, frequently resulting either in the synthesis of entirely new images or in outputs that fail to realize the intended edits. In contrast, scene graph-based image editing addresses this limitation by providing a structured representation of semantic entities and their relations, thereby offering improved controllability. However, existing scene graph editing methods typically depend on model fine-tuning, which incurs high computational cost and limits scalability. To this end, we introduce VENUS (Visual Editing with Noise inversion Using Scene graphs), a training-free framework for scene graph-guided image editing. Specifically, VENUS employs a split prompt conditioning strategy that disentangles the target object of the edit from its background context, while simultaneously leveraging noise inversion to preserve fidelity in unedited regions. Moreover, our proposed approach integrates scene graphs extracted from multimodal large language models with diffusion backbones, without requiring any additional training. Empirically, VENUS substantially improves both background preservation and semantic alignment on PIE-Bench, increasing PSNR from 22.45 to 24.80, SSIM from 0.79 to 0.84, and reducing LPIPS from 0.100 to 0.070 relative to the state-of-the-art scene graph editing model (SGEdit). In addition, VENUS enhances semantic consistency as measured by CLIP similarity (24.97 vs. 24.19). On EditVal, VENUS achieves the highest fidelity with a 0.87 DINO score and, crucially, reduces per-image runtime from 6-10 minutes to only 20-30 seconds. Beyond scene graph-based editing, VENUS also surpasses strong text-based editing baselines such as LEDIT++ and P2P+DirInv, thereby demonstrating consistent improvements across both paradigms.",

    "title": "SuperFlow: Training Flow Matching Models with RL on the Fly",
    "summary": "Recent progress in flow-based generative models and reinforcement learning (RL) has improved text-image alignment and visual quality. However, current RL training for flow models still has two main problems: (i) GRPO-style fixed per-prompt group sizes ignore variation in sampling importance across prompts, which leads to inefficient sampling and slower training; and (ii) trajectory-level advantages are reused as per-step estimates, which biases credit assignment along the flow. We propose SuperFlow, an RL training framework for flow-based models that adjusts group sizes with variance-aware sampling and computes step-level advantages in a way that is consistent with continuous-time flow dynamics. Empirically, SuperFlow reaches promising performance while using only 5.4% to 56.3% of the original training steps and reduces training time by 5.2% to 16.7% without any architectural changes. On standard text-to-image (T2I) tasks, including text rendering, compositional image generation, and human preference alignment, SuperFlow improves over SD3.5-M by 4.6% to 47.2%, and over Flow-GRPO by 1.7% to 16.0%.",

    "summary": "Learning how to learn efficiently is a fundamental challenge for biological agents and a growing concern for artificial ones. To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour. Together, these results provide a normative and biologically plausible account of learning speed control, linking self-regulated learning, effort allocation, and episodic memory estimation within a unified and tractable mathematical framework.",

Despite some reported success, the statistical significance and generalizability of EEG-to-fMRI predictions remains to be fully demonstrated. Here, we investigate the predictive power of EEG for both task-evoked and spontaneous activity of the somatomotor network measured by fMRI, based on data collected from healthy subjects in two different sessions. We trained subject-specific distributed-lag linear models of time-varying, multi-channel EEG spectral power using Sparse Group LASSO regularization, and we showed that learned models outperformed conventional EEG somatomotor rhythm predictors as well as massive univariate correlation models. Furthermore, we showed that learned models were statistically significantly better than appropriate null models in most subjects and conditions, although less frequently for spontaneous compared to task-evoked activity. Critically, predictions improved significantly when training and testing on data acquired in the same session relative to across sessions, highlighting the importance of temporally separating the collection of train and test data to avoid data leakage and optimistic bias in model generalization. In sum, while we demonstrate that EEG models can provide fMRI predictions with statistical significance, we also show that predictive power is impaired for spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity and for models trained on data acquired in a different session. Our findings highlight the need to explicitly consider these often overlooked issues in the growing literature of EEG-to-fMRI synthesis.",

    "summary": "Inspired by recent work on learning with distribution shift, we give a general outlier removal algorithm called iterative polynomial filtering and show a number of striking applications for supervised learning with contamination: (1) We show that any function class that can be approximated by low-degree polynomials with respect to a hypercontractive distribution can be efficiently learned under bounded contamination (also known as nasty noise). This is a surprising resolution to a longstanding gap between the complexity of agnostic learning and learning with contamination, as it was widely believed that low-degree approximators only implied tolerance to label noise. In particular, it implies the first efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces with $η$-bounded contamination up to error $2η+ε$ with respect to the Gaussian distribution. (2) For any function class that admits the (stronger) notion of sandwiching approximators, we obtain near-optimal learning guarantees even with respect to heavy additive contamination, where far more than $1/2$ of the training set may be added adversarially. Prior related work held only for regression and in a list-decodable setting. (3) We obtain the first efficient algorithms for tolerant testable learning of functions of halfspaces with respect to any fixed log-concave distribution. Even the non-tolerant case for a single halfspace in this setting had remained open. These results significantly advance our understanding of efficient supervised learning under contamination, a setting that has been much less studied than its unsupervised counterpart.",

    "summary": "Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.",

Trained on a large-scale database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio, the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.",

    "summary": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have shown strong potential for efficiently approximating complex nonlinear functions. However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can improve computational efficiency and flexibility. Yet, standard RBF-KANs often sacrifice accuracy relative to the original KAN design. In this work, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, a RBF-based KAN architecture that incorporates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness to close this performance gap. Our method employs freely learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align grid representations with activation patterns, enabling expressive and adaptive function approximation. Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation. Through a broad set of experiments, including multiscale function approximation, physics-informed machine learning, and PDE solution operator learning, Free-RBF-KAN achieves accuracy comparable to the original B-spline-based KAN while delivering faster training and inference. These results highlight Free-RBF-KAN as a compelling balance between computational efficiency and adaptive resolution, particularly for high-dimensional structured modeling tasks.",

    "summary": "Categorizing events using discriminant observables is central to many high-energy physics analyses. Yet, bin boundaries are often chosen by hand. A simple, popular choice is to apply argmax projections of multi-class scores and equidistant binning of one-dimensional discriminants. We propose a binning optimization for signal significance directly in multi-dimensional discriminants. We use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to define flexible bin boundary shapes for multi-class scores, while in one dimension (binary classification) we move bin boundaries directly. On this binning model, we study two optimization strategies: a differentiable and a Bayesian optimization approach. We study two toy setups: a binary classification and a three-class problem with two signals and backgrounds. In the one-dimensional case, both approaches achieve similar gains in signal sensitivity compared to equidistant binnings for a given number of bins. In the multi-dimensional case, the GMM-based binning defines sensitive categories as well, with the differentiable approach performing best. We show that, in particular for limited separability of the signal processes, our approach outperforms argmax classification even with optimized binning in the one-dimensional projections. Both methods are released as lightweight Python plugins intended for straightforward integration into existing analyses.",

We refer to our method as generalized Riesz regression, and we refer to the associated duality as automatic covariate balancing.

However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.",

To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories.

This penalty enforces consistency between the predicted initial condition and its forward evolution under the \\emph{same} forward Euler discretization used for dataset generation.

This design amplifies behavioral representations rather than allowing them to be overshadowed at the input level, yielding consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. We further analyze how different domain-informed data reduction strategies influence model performance, providing practical guidance for preprocessing in crime linkage contexts.

    "summary": "Qubit-efficient optimization studies how large combinatorial problems can be addressed with quantum circuits whose width is far smaller than the number of logical variables. In quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), objective values depend only on one- and two-body statistics, yet standard variational algorithms explore exponentially large Hilbert spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometric question: what is the minimal representation the objective itself requires?\n  Focusing on QUBO problems, we show that enforcing mutual consistency among pairwise statistics defines a convex body -- the level-2 Sherali-Adams polytope -- that captures the information on which quadratic objectives depend. We operationalize this geometry in a minimal variational pipeline that separates representation, consistency, and decoding: a logarithmic-width circuit produces pairwise moments, a differentiable information projection enforces local feasibility, and a maximum-entropy ensemble provides a principled global decoder.\n  This information-minimal construction achieves near-optimal approximation ratios on large unweighted Max-Cut instances (up to N=2000) at shallow depth, indicating that pairwise polyhedral geometry already captures the relevant structure in this regime. By making the information-minimal geometry explicit, this work establishes a clean baseline for qubit-efficient optimization and sharpens the question of where genuinely quantum structure becomes necessary.",

Intracranial pressure monitoring data was collected from 60 patients at Johns Hopkins. The data was segmented into individual cardiac cycles. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify each cardiac cycle into one of seven body positions. Neural network attention was extracted and was used to identify regions of interest in the waveform. Further directions for exploration are identified. This framework provides an extensible method to further understand the physiological and clinical underpinnings of the intracranial pressure waveform, which could lead to better diagnostic capabilities for intracranial pressure monitoring.",

    "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the learning task at the expense of discarding fundamental graph structures, thus reducing interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across dataset types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we propose novel graph pooling layers for structure-aware pooling via edge collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and its structural diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process. Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods (i) achieve top performance compared to alternative pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii) preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high accuracy across varying pooling ratios.",

    "summary": "A new wave of work on covariance cleaning and nonlinear shrinkage has delivered asymptotically optimal analytical solutions for large covariance matrices. Building on this progress, these ideas have been generalized to empirical cross-covariance matrices, whose singular-value shrinkage characterizes comovements between one set of assets and another. Existing analytical cross-covariance cleaners are derived under strong stationarity and large-sample assumptions, and they typically rely on mesoscopic regularity conditions such as bounded spectra; macroscopic common modes (e.g., a global market factor) violate these conditions. When applied to real equity returns, where dependence structures drift over time and global modes are prominent, we find that these theoretically optimal formulas do not translate into robust out-of-sample performance. We address this gap by designing a random-matrix-inspired neural architecture that operates in the empirical singular-vector basis and learns a nonlinear mapping from empirical singular values to their corresponding cleaned values. By construction, the network can recover the analytical solution as a special case, yet it remains flexible enough to adapt to non-stationary dynamics and mode-driven distortions. Trained on a long history of equity returns, the proposed method achieves a more favorable bias-variance trade-off than purely analytical cleaners and delivers systematically lower out-of-sample cross-covariance prediction errors. Our results demonstrate that combining random-matrix theory with machine learning makes asymptotic theories practically effective in realistic time-varying markets.",

It maintains two learnable latent tokens - an answer token and a reasoning state - that are iteratively refined by a compact, parameter-efficient recursive network. The recursive processing layer repeatedly updates the reasoning state given the full token sequence and then refines the answer token, in close analogy with iterative insurance pricing schemes.

    "summary": "Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the CREATE-IF-LATE (CIL) algorithm, which is a fully decentralized, resilient mechanism that enables self-creating RWs and prevents RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis shows that the CIL algorithm guarantees several desirable properties, such as (i) non-extinction of the RW population, (ii) almost sure boundedness of the RW population, and (iii) convergence of RW-based stochastic gradient descent even in the presence of Pac-Man with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Moreover, the learning process experiences at most a linear time delay due to Pac-Man interruptions and RW regeneration. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and public benchmark datasets validate our theoretical findings.",

    "summary": "The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought novel data processing and generative capabilities but also escalating energy requirements. This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms.",

Under a metric sub-regularity assumption, we prove that the proposed parametrization includes only iterations that locally achieve linear convergence-up to a vanishing bias term-and that it encompasses all iterations that do so at a sufficiently fast rate.

    "summary": "The constrained combinatorial multi-armed bandit model has been widely employed to solve problems in wireless networking and related areas, including the problem of wireless scheduling for throughput optimization under unknown channel conditions. Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughput constraint violation. These algorithms seek to minimize the virtual queue length in their algorithm design. However, in networks where channel conditions change abruptly, the resulting constraints may become infeasible, leading to unbounded growth in virtual queue lengths. In this paper, we make the key observation that the dynamics of the head-of-line age, i.e. the age of the oldest packet in the virtual queue, make it more robust when used in algorithm design compared to the virtual queue length. We therefore design a learning-based scheduling policy that uses the head-of-line age in place of the virtual queue length. We show that our policy matches state-of-the-art performance under i.i.d. network conditions. Crucially, we also show that the system remains stable even under abrupt changes in channel conditions and can rapidly recover from periods of constraint infeasibility.",

Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces. Overall, the proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting, providing a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for modern wireless networks.",

    "summary": "This paper develops an approach for multi-step forecasting of dynamical systems by integrating probabilistic input forecasting with physics-informed output prediction. Accurate multi-step forecasting of time series systems is important for the automatic control and optimization of physical processes, enabling more precise decision-making. While mechanistic-based and data-driven machine learning (ML) approaches have been employed for time series forecasting, they face significant limitations. Incomplete knowledge of process mathematical models limits mechanistic-based direct employment, while purely data-driven ML models struggle with dynamic environments, leading to poor generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-level strategy for physics-informed forecasting of dynamical systems. On the first level, input variables are forecast using a hybrid method that integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM) network into probabilistic state transition models (STMs). On the second level, these stochastically predicted inputs are sequentially fed into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to generate multi-step output predictions. The experimental results of the paper demonstrate that the hybrid input forecasting models achieve a higher log-likelihood and lower mean squared errors (MSE) compared to conventional STMs. Furthermore, the PINNs driven by the input forecasting models outperform their purely data-driven counterparts in terms of MSE and log-likelihood, exhibiting stronger generalization and forecasting performance across multiple test cases.",

We formulate individual claims reserving as a claim-level Markov decision process in which an agent sequentially updates outstanding claim liability (OCL) estimates over development, using continuous actions and a reward design that balances accuracy with stable reserve revisions. A key advantage of this reinforcement learning (RL) approach is that it can learn from all observed claim trajectories, including claims that remain open at valuation, thereby avoiding the reduced sample size and selection effects inherent in supervised methods trained on ultimate outcomes only. We also introduce practical components needed for actuarial use -- initialisation of new claims, temporally consistent tuning via a rolling-settlement scheme, and an importance-weighting mechanism to mitigate portfolio-level underestimation driven by the rarity of large claims. On CAS and SPLICE synthetic general insurance datasets, the proposed Soft Actor-Critic implementation delivers competitive claim-level accuracy and strong aggregate OCL performance, particularly for the immature claim segments that drive most of the liability.",

However, existing sharpness-aware methods for CL suffer from two key limitations: (1) they treat sharpness regularization as a unified signal without distinguishing the contributions of its components. and (2) they introduce substantial computational overhead that impedes practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose FLAD, a novel optimization framework that decomposes sharpness-aware perturbations into gradient-aligned and stochastic-noise components, and show that retaining only the noise component promotes generalization. We further introduce a lightweight scheduling scheme that enables FLAD to maintain significant performance gains even under constrained training time. FLAD can be seamlessly integrated into various CL paradigms and consistently outperforms standard and sharpness-aware optimizers in diverse experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality in CL.",

Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.",

This paper uses Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to develop a new approach to simulating such multivariate extreme events. Specifically, we assume that after transformation to a standard scale the distribution of the random phenomenon of interest is multivariate regular varying and use this to provide a sampling procedure for extremes on the original scale. Our procedure combines a Wasserstein-Aitchison Generative Adversarial Network (WA-GAN) to simulate the tail dependence structure on the standard scale with joint modeling of the univariate marginal tails on the original scale. The WA-GAN procedure relies on the angular measure-encoding the distribution on the unit simplex of the angles of extreme observations-after transformation to Aitchison coordinates, which allows the Wasserstein-GAN algorithm to be run in a linear space. Our method is applied both to simulated data under various tail dependence scenarios and to a financial data set from the Kenneth French Data Library. The proposed algorithm demonstrates strong performance compared to existing alternatives in the literature, both in capturing tail dependence structures and in generating accurate new extreme observations.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a meta-learning framework for credit risk assessment of Italian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that explicitly addresses the temporal misalignment of credit scoring models.\n  The approach aligns financial statement reference dates with evaluation dates, mitigating bias arising from publication delays and asynchronous data sources. It is based on a two-step temporal decomposition that at first estimates annual probabilities of default (PDs) anchored to balance-sheet reference dates (December 31st) through a static model. Then it models the monthly evolution of PDs using higher-frequency behavioral data. Finally, we employ stacking-based architecture to aggregate multiple scoring systems, each capturing complementary aspects of default risk, into a unified predictive model. In this way, first level model outputs are treated as learned representations that encode non-linear relationships in financial and behavioral indicators, allowing integration of new expert-based features without retraining base models. This design provides a coherent and interpretable solution to challenges typical of low-default environments, including heterogeneous default definitions and reporting delays. Empirical validation shows that the framework effectively captures credit risk evolution over time, improving temporal consistency and predictive stability relative to standard ensemble methods.",

    "summary": "Nonequilibrium electronic forces play a central role in voltage-driven phase transitions but are notoriously expensive to evaluate in dynamical simulations. Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.",

    "summary": "Reduced-order modeling lies at the interface of numerical analysis and data-driven scientific computing, providing principled ways to compress high-fidelity simulations in science and engineering. We propose a training framework that couples a continuous-time form of operator inference with the adjoint-state method to obtain robust data-driven reduced-order models. This method minimizes a trajectory-based loss between reduced-order solutions and projected snapshot data, which removes the need to estimate time derivatives from noisy measurements and provides intrinsic temporal regularization through time integration. We derive the corresponding continuous adjoint equations to compute gradients efficiently and implement a gradient based optimizer to update the reduced model parameters. Each iteration only requires one forward reduced order solve and one adjoint solve, followed by inexpensive gradient assembly, making the method attractive for large-scale simulations. We validate the proposed method on three partial differential equations: viscous Burgers' equation, the two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation, and an advection-diffusion equation. We perform systematic comparisons against standard operator inference under two perturbation regimes, namely reduced temporal snapshot density and additive Gaussian noise. For clean data, both approaches deliver similar accuracy, but in situations with sparse sampling and noise, the proposed adjoint-based training provides better accuracy and enhanced roll-out stability.",

    "summary": "Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering is crucial for signal processing and data analysis. Although deep learning approaches, particularly those leveraging Contrastive Learning (CL), are prominent for MTS representation, existing CL-based models face two key limitations: 1) neglecting clustering information during positive/negative sample pair construction, and 2) introducing unreasonable inductive biases, e.g., destroying time dependence and periodicity through augmentation strategies, compromising representation quality. This paper, therefore, proposes a Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive (TFEC) learning framework. To preserve temporal structure while generating low-distortion representations, a temporal-frequency Co-EnHancement (CoEH) mechanism is introduced. Accordingly, a synergistic dual-path representation and cluster distribution learning framework is designed to jointly optimize cluster structure and representation fidelity. Experiments on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate TFEC's superiority, achieving 4.48% average NMI gains over SOTA methods, with ablation studies validating the design.

    "summary": "Medical time series data, such as EEG and ECG, are vital for diagnosing neurological and cardiovascular diseases. However, their precise interpretation faces significant challenges due to high annotation costs, leading to data scarcity, and the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in capturing complex temporal patterns. To address these issues, we propose CoDAC (Contextual Discrepancy-Aware Contrastive learning), a novel framework that enhances diagnostic accuracy and generalization, particularly in small-sample settings. CoDAC leverages external healthy data and introduces a Contextual Discrepancy Estimator (CDE), built upon a Transformer-based Autoencoder, to precisely quantify abnormal signals through context-aware anomaly scores. These scores dynamically inform a Dynamic Multi-views Contrastive Framework (DMCF), which adaptively weights different temporal views to focus contrastive learning on diagnostically relevant, discrepant regions. Our encoder combines dilated convolutions with multi-head attention for robust feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's Disease EEG, Parkinson's Disease EEG, and Myocardial Infarction ECG datasets demonstrate CoDAC's superior performance across all metrics, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially under low label availability. Ablation studies further validate the critical contributions of CDE and DMCF. CoDAC offers a robust and interpretable solution for medical time series diagnosis, effectively mitigating data scarcity challenges.",

For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines. Interpretability analysis confirms that our multi-scale causal serialization effectively drives attention toward cliff-determining differences.",

The dominant approach, adaptive sufficient-statistics perturbation (AdaSSP), adds an adaptively chosen perturbation to the sufficient statistics, namely, the matrix $X^{\\top}X$ and the vector $X^{\\top}Y$, and is known to achieve near-optimal accuracy and to have strong empirical performance. In contrast, methods that rely on Gaussian-sketching, which ensure differential privacy by pre-multiplying the data with a random Gaussian matrix, are widely used in federated and distributed regression, yet remain relatively uncommon for DP-OLS. In this work, we introduce the iterative Hessian mixing, a novel DP-OLS algorithm that relies on Gaussian sketches and is inspired by the iterative Hessian sketch algorithm. We provide utility analysis for the iterative Hessian mixing as well as a new analysis for the previous methods that rely on Gaussian sketches. Then, we show that our new approach circumvents the intrinsic limitations of the prior methods and provides non-trivial improvements over AdaSSP. We conclude by running an extensive set of experiments across standard benchmarks to demonstrate further that our approach consistently outperforms these prior baselines.",

    "summary": "Clustering with bandit feedback refers to the problem of partitioning a set of items, where the clustering algorithm can sequentially query the items to receive noisy observations. The problem is formally posed as the task of partitioning the arms of an N-armed stochastic bandit according to their underlying distributions, grouping two arms together if and only if they share the same distribution, using samples collected sequentially and adaptively. This setting has gained attention in recent years due to its applicability in recommendation systems and crowdsourcing. Existing works on clustering with bandit feedback rely on a strong assumption that the underlying distributions are sub-Gaussian. As a consequence, the existing methods mainly cover settings with linearly-separable clusters, which has little practical relevance. We introduce a framework of ``nonparametric clustering with bandit feedback'', where the underlying arm distributions are not constrained to any parametric, and hence, it is applicable for active clustering of real-world datasets. We adopt a kernel-based approach, which allows us to reformulate the nonparametric problem as the task of clustering the arms according to their kernel mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Building on this formulation, we introduce the KABC algorithm with theoretical correctness guarantees and analyze its sampling budget. We introduce a notion of signal-to-noise ratio for this problem that depends on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between the arm distributions and on their variance in the RKHS. Our algorithm is adaptive to this unknown quantity: it does not require it as an input yet achieves instance-dependent guarantees.",

We extend this theory to deep reinforcement learning, proving that the concentration of the generalized posterior over policies is governed by the local learning coefficient (LLC), an invariant of the geometry of the regret function. This theory predicts that Bayesian phase transitions in reinforcement learning should proceed from simple policies with high regret to complex policies with low regret. We verify this prediction empirically in a gridworld environment exhibiting stagewise policy development: phase transitions over SGD training manifest as \"opposing staircases\" where regret decreases sharply while the LLC increases. Notably, the LLC detects phase transitions even when estimated on a subset of states where the policies appear identical in terms of regret, suggesting it captures changes in the underlying algorithm rather than just performance.",

However, a drawback is their limited scalability to large data sets. To alleviate this, full-scale approximations (FSAs) combine predictive process methods and covariance tapering, thus approximating both global and local structures. We show how iterative methods can be used to reduce computational costs in calculating likelihoods, gradients, and predictive distributions with FSAs. In particular, we introduce a novel preconditioner and show theoretically and empirically that it accelerates the conjugate gradient method's convergence speed and mitigates its sensitivity with respect to the FSA parameters and the eigenvalue structure of the original covariance matrix, and we demonstrate empirically that it outperforms a state-of-the-art pivoted Cholesky preconditioner. Furthermore, we introduce an accurate and fast way to calculate predictive variances using stochastic simulation and iterative methods. In addition, we show how our newly proposed fully independent training conditional (FITC) preconditioner can also be used in iterative methods for Vecchia approximations. In our experiments, it outperforms existing state-of-the-art preconditioners for Vecchia approximations.

    "summary": "In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance (a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect) poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.",

    "summary": "Due to strict rate and reliability demands, wireless image transmission remains difficult for both classical layered designs and joint source-channel coding (JSCC), especially under low latency. Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps. Overall, LTT provides a deterministic, physically interpretable, and computation-efficient framework for generative wireless image decoding across diverse channels.",

However, it is unclear whether and how different types of topographic regularization shape robustness, representational structure, and functional organization during end-to-end training. We address this question by comparing TCNNs trained with two local spatial losses applied to a penultimate-layer topographic grid: i) Weight Similarity (WS), whose objective penalizes differences between neighboring units' incoming weight vectors, and ii) Activation Similarity (AS), whose objective penalizes differences between neighboring units' activation patterns over stimuli. We evaluate the trained models on classification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input degradation, the spatial organization of learned representations, and development of category-selective \"expert units\" in the penultimate layer. Both losses changed inter-unit correlation structure, but in qualitatively different ways. WS produced smooth topographies, with correlated neighborhoods. In contrast, AS produced a bimodal inter-unit correlation structure that lacked spatial smoothness. AS and WS training increased robustness relative to control (non-topographic) models: AS improved robustness to image degradation on CIFAR-10, WS did so on MNIST, and both improved robustness to weight perturbations. WS was also associated with greater input sensitivity at the unit level and stronger functional localization. In addition, as compared to control models, both AS and WS produced differences in orientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units. Together, these results show that local topographic regularization can improve robustness during end-to-end training while systematically reshaping representational structure.",

Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis.

    "summary": "Anomaly prediction (AP) in multivariate time series (MTS) is crucial to ensure system dependability. Existing methods either focus solely on whether an anomaly is imminent without providing precise predictions for the future anomaly, or performing predictions directly on historical data, which is easily drowned out by the normal patterns. To address the challenges in AP task, we propose RED-F, a novel framework comprised of the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). We utilize REM to construct a baseline of normal patterns from historical data, providing a foundation for subsequent predictions of anomalies. Then DFM simultaneously predicts both the constructed normal pattern and the current window, employing a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult AP task into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictions. To enable the forecasting model to generate a prediction not easily obscured by normal patterns, we propose a Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) training objective to enhance its sensitivity to the current window. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of RED-F in anomaly prediction tasks. Our code is available at http://github.com/PenyChen/RED-F.",

    "summary": "We study a learning-augmented variant of the secretary problem, recently introduced by Fujii and Yoshida (2023), in which the decision-maker has access to machine-learned predictions of candidate values. The central challenge is to balance consistency and robustness: when predictions are accurate, the algorithm should select a near-optimal secretary, while under inaccurate predictions it should still guarantee a bounded competitive ratio.\n  We consider both the classical Random Order Secretary Problem (ROSP), where candidates arrive in a uniformly random order, and a more natural learning-augmented model in which the decision-maker may choose the arrival order based on predicted values. We call this model the Chosen Order Secretary Problem (COSP), capturing scenarios such as interview schedules set in advance.\n  We propose a new randomized algorithm applicable to both ROSP and COSP. Our method switches from fully trusting predictions to a threshold-based rule once a large prediction deviation is detected. Let $ε\\in [0,1]$ denote the maximum multiplicative prediction error. For ROSP, our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $\\max\\{0.221, (1-ε)/(1+ε)\\}$, improving upon the prior bound of $\\max\\{0.215, (1-ε)/(1+ε)\\}$. For COSP, we achieve $\\max\\{0.262, (1-ε)/(1+ε)\\}$, surpassing the $0.25$ worst-case bound for prior approaches and moving closer to the classical secretary benchmark of $1/e \\approx 0.368$.

    "summary": "Finding low-dimensional interpretable models of complex physical fields such as turbulence remains an open question, 80 years after the pioneer work of Kolmogorov. Estimating high-dimensional probability distributions from data samples suffers from an optimization and an approximation curse of dimensionality. It may be avoided by following a hierarchic probability flow from coarse to fine scales. This inverse renormalization group is defined by conditional probabilities across scales, renormalized in a wavelet basis. For a $\\vvarphi^4$ scalar potential, sampling these hierarchic models avoids the critical slowing down at the phase transition. In a well chosen wavelet basis, conditional probabilities can be captured with low dimensional parametric models, because interactions between wavelet coefficients are local in space and scales. An outstanding issue is also to approximate non-Gaussian fields having long-range interactions in space and across scales. We introduce low-dimensional models of wavelet conditional probabilities with the scattering covariance. It is calculated with a second wavelet transform, which defines interactions over two hierarchies of scales. We estimate and sample these wavelet scattering models to generate 2D vorticity fields of turbulence, and images of dark matter densities.",

This work presents a novel Surrogate-Based Optimization framework based on Clustering, SBOC for global optimization of such systems, which can be used with any surrogate modeling technique. At each iteration, it uses a single surrogate model for the entire domain, employs k-means clustering to identify unexplored domain, and exploits a local region around the surrogate optimum to potentially add three new sample points in the domain. SBOC has been tested against sixteen promising benchmarking algorithms using 52 analytical test functions of varying input dimensionalities and shape profiles. It successfully identified a global minimum for most test functions with substantially lower computational effort than other algorithms. It worked especially well on test functions with four or more input variables. It was also among the top six algorithms in approaching a global minimum closely. Overall, SBOC is a robust, reliable, and efficient algorithm for global optimization of box-constrained systems.",

    "summary": "Over-smoothing and over-squashing have been extensively studied in the literature on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) over the past years. We challenge this prevailing focus in GNN research, arguing that these phenomena are less critical for practical applications than assumed. We suggest that performance decreases often stem from uninformative receptive fields rather than over-smoothing. We support this position with extensive experiments on several standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating that accuracy and over-smoothing are mostly uncorrelated and that optimal model depths remain small even with mitigation techniques, thus highlighting the negligible role of over-smoothing. Similarly, we challenge that over-squashing is always detrimental in practical applications. Instead, we posit that the distribution of relevant information over the graph frequently factorises and is often localised within a small k-hop neighbourhood, questioning the necessity of jointly observing entire receptive fields or engaging in an extensive search for long-range interactions. The results of our experiments show that architectural interventions designed to mitigate over-squashing fail to yield significant performance gains. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in theoretical research, urging a diligent analysis of learning tasks and datasets using statistics that measure the underlying distribution of label-relevant information to better understand their localisation and factorisation.",

    "summary": "Drug discovery represents a time-consuming and financially intensive process, and virtual screening can accelerate it. Scoring functions, as one of the tools guiding virtual screening, have their precision closely tied to screening efficiency. In our previous study, we developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork), but it suffers from the defect in representing protein-ligand contact maps. Incorrect binding modes inevitably lead to poor affinity predictions, so accurate prediction of the protein-ligand contact map is desired to improve PLANET. In this study, we have proposed PLANET v2.0 as an upgraded version. The model is trained via multi-objective training strategy and incorporates the Mixture Density Network to predict binding modes. Except for the probability density distributions of non-covalent interactions, we innovatively employ another Gaussian mixture model to describe the relationship between distance and energy of each interaction pair and predict protein-ligand affinity like calculating the mathematical expectation. As on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET v2.0 demonstrates excellent scoring power, ranking power, and docking power. The screening power of PLANET v2.0 gets notably improved compared to PLANET and Glide SP and it demonstrates robust validation on a commercial ultra-large-scale dataset. Given its efficiency and accuracy, PLANET v2.0 can hopefully become one of the practical tools for virtual screening workflows.

    "summary": "Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.",

We introduce GraphPerf-RT, the first surrogate that unifies task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph representation with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Multi-task evidential heads predict makespan, energy, cache and branch misses, and utilization with calibrated uncertainty (Normal-Inverse-Gamma), enabling risk-aware scheduling that filters low-confidence rollouts. We validate GraphPerf-RT on three embedded ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RUBIK Pi), achieving R^2 > 0.95 with well-calibrated uncertainty (ECE < 0.05). To demonstrate end-to-end scheduling utility, we integrate the surrogate with four RL methods on Jetson TX2: single-agent model-free (SAMFRL), single-agent model-based (SAMBRL), multi-agent model-free (MAMFRL-D3QN), and multi-agent model-based (MAMBRL-D3QN). Experiments across 5 seeds (200 episodes each) show that MAMBRL-D3QN with GraphPerf-RT as the world model achieves 66% makespan reduction (0.97 +/- 0.35s) and 82% energy reduction (0.006 +/- 0.005J) compared to model-free baselines, demonstrating that accurate, uncertainty-aware surrogates enable effective model-based planning on thermally constrained embedded systems.",

We prove that the gradient flow either converges to a critical point or diverges to infinity while the loss converges to an asymptotic critical value. Moreover, we prove the existence of a threshold $\\varepsilon>0$ such that the loss value of any gradient flow initialized at most $\\varepsilon$ above the optimal level converges to it. For polynomial target functions and sufficiently big architecture and data set, we prove that the optimal loss value is zero and can only be realized asymptotically. From this setting, we deduce our main result that any gradient flow with sufficiently good initialization diverges to infinity. Our proof heavily relies on the geometry of o-minimal structures. We confirm these theoretical findings with numerical experiments and extend our investigation to more realistic scenarios, where we observe an analogous behavior.",

On the PubMed citation network dataset, we observe significant classification difficulty disparities, with Category 2 achieving only 74.4% accuracy in traditional GCN, 7.5% lower than Category 1. To address this, we propose a Wasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM), training specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization and residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for Category 2. The WR distance metric optimizes representation similarity between models, particularly focusing on improving Category 2 performance. Our adaptive fusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific performance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further guides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model representations, enabling more principled integration of complementary features.\n  Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across categories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2), outperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches. The coefficient of variation (CV) of WR-EFM's category accuracies is 0.013, 77.6% lower than GCN's 0.058, demonstrating superior stability. Notably, WR-EFM improves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the effectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns.

    "title": "CompNO: A Novel Foundation Model approach for solving Partial Differential Equations",
    "summary": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical phenomena, but their numerical solution remains computationally demanding, especially when repeated simulations are required across many parameter settings. Recent Scientific Foundation Models (SFMs) aim to alleviate this cost by learning universal surrogates from large collections of simulated systems, yet they typically rely on monolithic architectures with limited interpretability and high pretraining expense. In this work we introduce Compositional Neural Operators (CompNO), a compositional neural operator framework for parametric PDEs. Instead of pretraining a single large model on heterogeneous data, CompNO first learns a library of Foundation Blocks, where each block is a parametric Fourier neural operator specialized to a fundamental differential operator (e.g. convection, diffusion, nonlinear convection). These blocks are then assembled, via lightweight Adaptation Blocks, into task-specific solvers that approximate the temporal evolution operator for target PDEs. A dedicated boundary-condition operator further enforces Dirichlet constraints exactly at inference time. We validate CompNO on one-dimensional convection, diffusion, convection--diffusion and Burgers' equations from the PDEBench suite. The proposed framework achieves lower relative L2 error than strong baselines (PFNO, PDEFormer and in-context learning based models) on linear parametric systems, while remaining competitive on nonlinear Burgers' flows. The model maintains exact boundary satisfaction with zero loss at domain boundaries, and exhibits robust generalization across a broad range of Peclet and Reynolds numbers. These results demonstrate that compositional neural operators provide a scalable and physically interpretable pathway towards foundation models for PDEs.",

Computing persistent homology produces persistence diagrams, which have been successfully used in diverse domains. Despite its widespread use, persistent homology is simply impossible to compute when a dataset is very large. We study a statistical approach to the problem of computing persistent homology for massive datasets using a multiple subsampling framework and extend it to three summaries of persistent homology: Hölder continuous vectorizations of persistence diagrams; the alternative representation as persistence measures; and standard persistence diagrams. Specifically, we derive finite sample convergence rates for empirical means for persistent homology and practical guidance on interpreting and tuning parameters. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data. We demonstrate the performance of multiple subsampling in a permutation test to analyze the topological structure of Poincaré embeddings of large lexical databases.",

    "summary": "Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have been widely applied in real-time scenarios, such as in-car assistants and online meeting comprehension. In practice, audio inputs are often corrupted by device and environmental noise, leading to performance degradation. However, existing LALM studies on noise lack quantitative analysis and rely mainly on intuition and empirical observation, thus failing to understand practical robustness. To address this issue, we introduce Signal Embedding Energy (SEE), a method for quantifying the impact of noise intensity on LALM inputs, enabling the differentiation of LALM robustness in real-world deployments. SEE introduces a perspective based on structured activation subspaces derived from the model's internal representations, which more accurately captures its perception of noise than raw audio features. Across experiments, SEE exhibits a strong correlation with LALM performance, achieving a correlation of 0.98. Surprisingly, traditional audio denoising methods are only marginally effective for LALMs, and, in some cases, even increase SEE and impair performance. This suggests a mismatch between speech-centric denoising objectives and the noise sensitivity of modern LALMs. Therefore, we propose a mitigation strategy derived from SEE to denoise LALM inputs, outperforming existing denoising methods. This paper introduces a novel metric for noise quantification in LALMs, providing guidance for robustness improvements in real-world deployments.",

    "summary": "A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up to 86.7\\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.",

    "summary": "Although multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has demonstrated success in dimensionality reduction for unlabeled multi-view data, most existing methods reduce feature redundancy by focusing on linear correlations among features but often overlook complex nonlinear dependencies. This limits the effectiveness of feature selection. In addition, existing methods fuse similarity graphs from multiple views by employing sample-invariant weights to preserve local structure. However, this process fails to account for differences in local neighborhood clarity among samples within each view, thereby hindering accurate characterization of the intrinsic local structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a Kernel Alignment-based multi-view unsupervised FeatUre selection with Sample-level adaptive graph lEarning method (KAFUSE) to address these issues. Specifically, we first employ kernel alignment with an orthogonal constraint to reduce feature redundancy in both linear and nonlinear relationships. Then, a cross-view consistent similarity graph is learned by applying sample-level fusion to each slice of a tensor formed by stacking similarity graphs from different views, which automatically adjusts the view weights for each sample during fusion. These two steps are integrated into a unified model for feature selection, enabling mutual enhancement between them. Extensive experiments on real multi-view datasets demonstrate the superiority of KAFUSE over state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "Decision trees are powerful machine learning algorithms, widely used in fields such as economics and medicine for their simplicity and interpretability. However, decision trees such as CART are prone to overfitting, especially when grown deep or the sample size is small. Conventional methods to reduce overfitting include pre-pruning and post-pruning, which constrain the growth of uninformative branches. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach by introducing a covariance-driven splitting criterion for regression trees (CovRT). This method is more robust to overfitting than the empirical risk minimization criterion used in CART, as it produces more balanced and stable splits and more effectively identifies covariates with true signals. We establish an oracle inequality of CovRT and prove that its predictive accuracy is comparable to that of CART in high-dimensional settings. We find that CovRT achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to CART in both simulations and real-world tasks.",

    "summary": "Fraudulent activities on digital banking services are becoming more intricate by the day, challenging existing defenses. While older rule driven methods struggle to keep pace, even precision focused algorithms fall short when new scams are introduced. These tools typically overlook subtle shifts in criminal behavior, missing crucial signals. Because silent breaches cost institutions far more than flagged but legitimate actions, catching every possible case is crucial. High sensitivity to actual threats becomes essential when oversight leads to heavy losses. One key aim here involves reducing missed fraud cases without spiking incorrect alerts too much. This study builds a system using group learning methods adjusted through smart threshold choices. Using real world transaction records shared openly, where cheating acts rarely appear among normal activities, tests are run under practical skewed distributions. The outcomes reveal that approximately 91 percent of actual fraud is detected, outperforming standard setups that rely on unchanging rules when dealing with uneven examples across classes. When tested in live settings, the fraud detection system connects directly to an online banking transaction flow, stopping questionable activities before they are completed. Alongside this setup, a browser add on built for Chrome is designed to flag deceptive web links and reduce threats from harmful sites. These results show that adjusting decisions by cost impact and validating across entire systems makes deployment more stable and realistic for today's digital banking platforms.",

However, their underlying mechanisms remain open for further exploration. The energy-based perspective has long provided a valuable principle for understanding neural computation. In this paper, we revisit the principle of energy as a lens to understand attention-based Transformer models. We present a unified energy-based framework which is composed of three key components: the local energy $E_i$, the global energy $F$, and the employed optimization algorithms. We show that different attention forms including unnormalized linear attention, gated linear attention and standard softmax attention can be induced by choosing their corresponding recipes within this framework. Building on this framework, we propose energy-based modifications of attention structures. Inspired by classical gradient descent (GD) algorithms, we extend the original attention formulation based on standard GD to the momentum-based GD, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), and Newton's method, each inducing a corresponding new attention structure. Our experiments provide preliminary support for the potential of the energy-based framework for designing attention mechanisms.",

    "summary": "Bayesian Optimization with multi-objective acquisition functions such as q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) requires efficient candidate optimization to maximize acquisition function values. Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization.",

We explain this ``missing capacity'' by introducing the innovation capacity $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the total capacity allocated to readout components orthogonal to the input filtration (Doob innovations, including input-noise mixing). Using a basis-free Hilbert-space formulation of the predictable/innovation decomposition, we prove the conservation law $C_{\\mathrm{ip}}+C_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\mathrm{rank}(Σ_{XX})\\le d$, so predictable and innovation capacities exactly partition the rank of the observable readout dimension covariance $Σ_{XX}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\rm d\\times d}$. In linear-Gaussian Johnson-Nyquist regimes, $Σ_{XX}(T)=S+T N_0$, the split becomes a generalized-eigenvalue shrinkage rule and gives an explicit monotone tradeoff between temperature and predictable capacity. Geometrically, in whitened coordinates the predictable and innovation components correspond to complementary covariance ellipsoids, making $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ a trace-controlled innovation budget. A large $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ forces a high-dimensional innovation subspace with a variance floor and under mild mixing and anti-concentration assumptions this yields extensive innovation-block differential entropy and exponentially many distinguishable histories. Finally, we give an information-theoretic lower bound showing that learning the induced innovation-block law in total variation requires a number of samples that scales with the effective innovation dimension, supporting the generative utility of noisy physical reservoirs.",

Invariance learning, an approach that focuses on identifying features invariant across environments, improves model generalization by capturing stable relationships, which may represent causal effects when the data distribution is encoded within a structural equation model (SEM) and satisfies modularity conditions. This has led to a growing body of work that builds on invariance learning, leveraging the inherent heterogeneity across environments to develop methods that provide causal explanations while enhancing robust prediction. However, in many practical scenarios, obtaining complete outcome data from each environment is challenging due to the high cost or complexity of data collection. This limitation in available data hinders the development of models that fully leverage environmental heterogeneity, making it crucial to address missing outcomes to improve both causal insights and robust prediction. In this work, we derive an estimator from the invariance objective under missing outcomes. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees on variable selection property and $\\ell_2$ error convergence rates, which are influenced by the proportion of missing data and the quality of imputation models across environments. We evaluate the performance of the new estimator through extensive simulations and demonstrate its application using the UCI Bike Sharing dataset to predict the count of bike rentals. The results show that despite relying on a biased imputation model, the estimator is efficient and achieves lower prediction error, provided the bias is within a reasonable range.",

Traditional supervised learning approaches require extensive labeled datasets, making unsupervised methods more viable for uncovering meaningful insights from patient feedback. This study explores unsupervised methods to extract meaningful topics from 439 survey responses collected from a healthcare system in Wisconsin, USA. A keyword-based filtering approach was applied to isolate complaint-related feedback using a domain-specific lexicon. To delve deeper and analyze dominant topics in feedback, we explored traditional topic modeling methods, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Gibbs Sampling Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (GSDMM), alongside BERTopic, an advanced neural embedding-based clustering approach. To improve coherence and interpretability where data are scarce and consist of short-texts, we propose kBERT, an integration of BERT embeddings with k-means clustering. Model performance was assessed using coherence scores (Cv ) for topic interpretability and average Inverted Rank-Biased Overlap (IRBOavg) for topic diversity. Results indicate that kBERT achieves the highest coherence (Cv = 0.53) and distinct topic separation (IRBOavg = 1.00), outperforming all other models in short-text healthcare feedback analysis. Our findings emphasize the importance of embedding-based techniques for topic identification and highlight the need for context-aware models in healthcare analytics.",

However, due to the high labelling cost of video summarization, existing studies have to be conducted on small-scale datasets, leading to limited performance and generalization capacity. In this work, we introduce the use of dense video captions as a supervision signal to train video summarization models. Motivated by this, we propose Cap2Sum, a model that learns to summarize videos by generating captions, to exploit dense video caption annotations. This weakly-supervised approach allows us to train the models on large-scale dense video caption datasets to achieve better performance and generalization capacity. To further improve the generalization capacity, we introduce a CLIP (a strong vision-language model) Prior mechanism to enhance the learning of important objects that captions may ignore in the videos. In practice, Cap2Sum can perform zero-shot video summarization or be fine-tuned by the ground-truth summary or video caption of the target dataset. To examine the performance of Cap2Sum after weakly-supervised fine-tuning by the video captions, we propose two new datasets, TVSum-Caption and SumMe-Caption, which are derived from two common video summarization datasets and will be publicly released. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in performance and generalization capacity compared with previous methods.",

    "title": "R3-RECON: Radiance-Field-Free Active Reconstruction via Renderability",
    "summary": "In active reconstruction, an embodied agent must decide where to look next to efficiently acquire views that support high-quality novel-view rendering. Recent work on active view planning for neural rendering largely derives next-best-view (NBV) criteria by backpropagating through radiance fields or estimating information entropy over 3D Gaussian primitives. While effective, these strategies tightly couple view selection to heavy, representation-specific mechanisms and fail to account for the computational and resource constraints required for lightweight online deployment. In this paper, we revisit active reconstruction from a renderability-centric perspective. We propose $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON, a radiance-fields-free active reconstruction framework that induces an implicit, pose-conditioned renderability field over SE(3) from a lightweight voxel map. Our formulation aggregates per-voxel online observation statistics into a unified scalar renderability score that is cheap to update and can be queried in closed form at arbitrary candidate viewpoints in milliseconds, without requiring gradients or radiance-field training. This renderability field is strongly correlated with image-space reconstruction error, naturally guiding NBV selection. We further introduce a panoramic extension that estimates omnidirectional (360$^\\circ$) view utility to accelerate candidate evaluation. In the standard indoor Replica dataset, $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON achieves more uniform novel-view quality and higher 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) reconstruction accuracy than recent active GS baselines with matched view and time budgets.",

    "summary": "Video generation models have emerged as high-fidelity models of the physical world, capable of synthesizing high-quality videos capturing fine-grained interactions between agents and their environments conditioned on multi-modal user inputs. Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a data-driven methodology for the control of static hydraulic impact hammers, also known as rock breakers, which are commonly used in the mining industry. The task addressed in this work is that of controlling the rock-breaker so its end-effector reaches arbitrary target poses, which is required in normal operation to place the hammer on top of rocks that need to be fractured. The proposed approach considers several constraints, such as unobserved state variables due to limited sensing and the strict requirement of using a discrete control interface at the joint level. First, the proposed methodology addresses the problem of system identification to obtain an approximate dynamic model of the hydraulic arm. This is done via supervised learning, using only teleoperation data. The learned dynamic model is then exploited to obtain a controller capable of reaching target end-effector poses. For policy synthesis, both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are utilized and contrasted. As a case study, we consider the automation of a Bobcat E10 mini-excavator arm with a hydraulic impact hammer attached as end-effector. Using this machine, both the system identification and policy synthesis stages are studied in simulation and in the real world. The best RL-based policy consistently reaches target end-effector poses with position errors below 12 cm and pitch angle errors below 0.08 rad in the real world. Considering that the impact hammer has a 4 cm diameter chisel, this level of precision is sufficient for breaking rocks. Notably, this is accomplished by relying only on approximately 68 min of teleoperation data to train and 8 min to evaluate the dynamic model, and without performing any adjustments for a successful policy Sim2Real transfer. A demonstration of policy execution in the real world can be found in https://youtu.be/e-7tDhZ4ZgA.",

    "summary": "Structural vibration testing plays a key role in aerospace engineering for evaluating dynamic behaviour, ensuring reliability and verifying structural integrity. These tests rely on accurate and robust data acquisition systems (DAQ) to capture high-quality acceleration data. However, commercial DAQs that provide the required performance and features are often expensive and complex, limiting their accessibility for small-scale research and experimental applications. This work presents the design and experimental validation of an affordable and in-house-developed acceleration DAQ, tested on a small fixed-wing UAV through several Taxi Vibration Test (TVT) runs and ambient vibration measurements. The proposed system integrates several OrangePi 3 LTS single-board computers with multiple LSM6DS3TR-C MEMS inertial measurement units operating simultaneously via an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication interface, managed under a Python-based master/slave architecture. Data is acquired at a stable sampling rate of approximately 208 Hz and post-processed using Welch's method to estimate their Power Spectral Density (PSD). Results confirm the system ability to provide consistent multi-sensor acceleration data and repeatable PSD profiles under the same test conditions; thus, demonstrating its reliability. With a total hardware cost below 600 EUR (approximately 690 USD), the developed DAQ offers a compact, scalable and cost-effective alternative for aerospace vibration analysis and structural testing.",

    "summary": "The teleoperation of robotic hands is limited by the high costs of depth cameras and sensor gloves, commonly used to estimate hand relative joint positions (XYZ). We present a novel, cost-effective approach using three webcams for triangulation-based tracking to approximate relative joint angles (theta) of human fingers. We also introduce a modified DexHand, a low-cost robotic hand from TheRobotStudio, to demonstrate THETA's real-time application. Data collection involved 40 distinct hand gestures using three 640x480p webcams arranged at 120-degree intervals, generating over 48,000 RGB images. Joint angles were manually determined by measuring midpoints of the MCP, PIP, and DIP finger joints. Captured RGB frames were processed using a DeepLabV3 segmentation model with a ResNet-50 backbone for multi-scale hand segmentation. The segmented images were then HSV-filtered and fed into THETA's architecture, consisting of a MobileNetV2-based CNN classifier optimized for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and a 9-channel input tensor encoding multi-perspective hand representations. The classification model maps segmented hand views into discrete joint angles, achieving 97.18% accuracy, 98.72% recall, F1 Score of 0.9274, and a precision of 0.8906. In real-time inference, THETA captures simultaneous frames, segments hand regions, filters them, and compiles a 9-channel tensor for classification. Joint-angle predictions are relayed via serial to an Arduino, enabling the DexHand to replicate hand movements. Future research will increase dataset diversity, integrate wrist tracking, and apply computer vision techniques such as OpenAI-Vision. THETA potentially ensures cost-effective, user-friendly teleoperation for medical, linguistic, and manufacturing applications.",

    "summary": "This work develops a unified nonlinear estimation-guidance-control framework for cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under a heterogeneous sensing topology, where sensing capabilities are non-uniform across interceptors. Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents' time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme.",

    "summary": "Supervised visuomotor policies have shown strong performance in robotic manipulation but often struggle in tasks with limited visual inputs, such as operations in confined spaces and dimly lit environments, or tasks requiring precise perception of object properties and environmental interactions. In such cases, tactile feedback becomes essential for manipulation. While the rapid progress of supervised visuomotor policies has benefited greatly from high-quality, reproducible simulation benchmarks in visual imitation, the visuotactile domain still lacks a similarly comprehensive and reliable benchmark for large-scale and rigorous evaluation. To address this, we introduce ManiFeel, a reproducible and scalable simulation benchmark designed to systematically study supervised visuotactile policy learning. ManiFeel offers a diverse suite of contact-rich and visually challenging manipulation tasks, a modular evaluation pipeline spanning sensing modalities, tactile representations, and policy architectures, as well as real-world validation. Through extensive experiments, ManiFeel demonstrates how tactile sensing enhances policy performance across diverse manipulation scenarios, ranging from precise contact-driven operations to visually constrained settings. In addition, the results reveal task-dependent strengths of different tactile modalities and identify key design principles and open challenges for robust visuotactile policy learning. Real-world evaluations further confirm that ManiFeel provides a reliable and meaningful foundation for benchmarking and future visuotactile policy development. To foster reproducibility and future research, we will release our codebase, datasets, training logs, and pretrained checkpoints, aiming to accelerate progress toward generalizable visuotactile policy learning and manipulation.",

    "summary": "Morphological computing, the use of the physical design of a robot to ease the realization of a given task has been proven to be a relevant concept in the context of swarm robotics. Here we demonstrate both experimentally and numerically, that the success of such a strategy may heavily rely on the type of policy adopted by the robots, as well as on the details of the physical design. To do so, we consider a swarm of robots, composed of Kilobots embedded in an exoskeleton, the design of which controls the propensity of the robots to align or anti-align with the direction of the external force they experience. We find experimentally that the contrast that was observed between the two morphologies in the success rate of a simple phototactic task, where the robots were programmed to stop when entering a light region, becomes dramatic, if the robots are not allowed to stop, and can only slow down. Building on a faithful physical model of the self-aligning dynamics of the robots, we perform numerical simulations and demonstrate on one hand that a precise tuning of the self-aligning strength around a sweet spot is required to achieve an efficient phototactic behavior, on the other hand that exploring a range of self-alignment strength allows for a rich expressivity of collective behaviors.",

    "summary": "Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and designed with motors enclosed inside to protect them from damage and dirt. Additionally, in-hand manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as reorienting a pen into a writing posture after picking it up from a desk. We previously developed PLEXUS hand (Precision-Lateral dEXteroUS manipulation hand), a lightweight (311 g) prosthetic hand driven by four motors. This prosthetic performed reorientation between precision and lateral grasps with various objects. However, its controller required predefined object widths and was limited to handling lightweight objects (of weight up to 34 g). This study addresses these limitations by employing motor current feedback. Combined with the hand's previously optimized single-axis thumb, this approach achieves more stable manipulation by estimating the object's width and adjusting the index finger position to maintain stable object holding during the reorientation. Experimental validation using primitive objects of various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in a 100% success rate with lightweight objects and maintained a high success rate (>=80) even with heavy aluminum prisms (of weight up to 289 g). By contrast, the performance without index finger coordination dropped to just 40% on the heaviest 289 g prism. The hand also successfully executed several daily tasks, including closing bottle caps and orienting a pen for writing.",

    "summary": "Autonomous 3D scanning of open-world target structures via drones remains challenging despite broad applications. Existing paradigms rely on restrictive assumptions or effortful human priors, limiting practicality, efficiency, and adaptability. Recent foundation models (FMs) offer great potential to bridge this gap. This paper investigates a critical research problem: What system architecture can effectively integrate FM knowledge for this task? We answer it with FlyCo, a principled FM-empowered perception-prediction-planning loop enabling fully autonomous, prompt-driven 3D target scanning in diverse unknown open-world environments. FlyCo directly translates low-effort human prompts (text, visual annotations) into precise adaptive scanning flights via three coordinated stages: (1) perception fuses streaming sensor data with vision-language FMs for robust target grounding and tracking; (2) prediction distills FM knowledge and combines multi-modal cues to infer the partially observed target's complete geometry; (3) planning leverages predictive foresight to generate efficient and safe paths with comprehensive target coverage. Building on this, we further design key components to boost open-world target grounding efficiency and robustness, enhance prediction quality in terms of shape accuracy, zero-shot generalization, and temporal stability, and balance long-horizon flight efficiency with real-time computability and online collision avoidance. Extensive challenging real-world and simulation experiments show FlyCo delivers precise scene understanding, high efficiency, and real-time safety, outperforming existing paradigms with lower human effort and verifying the proposed architecture's practicality. Comprehensive ablations validate each component's contribution. FlyCo also serves as a flexible, extensible blueprint, readily leveraging future FM and robotics advances. Code will be released.",

The morphology of robots can significantly influence how they interact with the physical world, crucial for manipulating objects in real-life scenarios. Conventional robotic manipulation strategies mainly rely on finger-shaped end effectors. However, achieving stable grasps on fragile, deformable, irregularly shaped, or slippery objects is challenging due to difficulty in establishing stable forces or geometric constraints. Here, we present surface-based manipulation strategies that diverge from classical grasping approaches, using flat surfaces as minimalist end-effectors. By adjusting surfaces' position and orientation, objects can be translated, rotated, and flipped across the surface using closed-loop control strategies. Since this method does not rely on stable grasping, it can adapt to objects of various shapes, sizes, and stiffness levels and can even manipulate the shape of deformable objects. Our results provide a new perspective for solving complex manipulation problems.",

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing inherently supports privacy-preserving interaction, making it a promising modality for room-scale HRI. However, existing mmWave-based interaction-sensing systems exhibit poor spatial generalization at unseen distances or viewpoints. To address this challenge, we introduce WaveMan, a spatially adaptive room-scale perception system that restores reliable human interaction sensing across arbitrary user positions. WaveMan integrates viewpoint alignment and spectrogram enhancement for spatial consistency, with dual-channel attention for robust feature extraction. Experiments across five participants show that, under fixed-position evaluation, WaveMan achieves the same cross-position accuracy as the baseline with five times fewer training positions. In random free-position testing, accuracy increases from 33.00% to 94.33%, enabled by the proposed method. These results demonstrate the feasibility of reliable, privacy-preserving interaction for household humanoid robots across unconstrained user positions.",

    "summary": "Autonomous flight of micro air vehicles (MAVs) in unknown, cluttered environments remains challenging for time-critical missions due to conservative maneuvering strategies. This article presents an integrated planning and control framework for high-speed, time-optimal autonomous flight of MAVs in cluttered environments. In each replanning cycle (100 Hz), a time-optimal trajectory under polynomial presentation is generated as a reference, with the time-allocation process accelerated by imitation learning. Subsequently, a time-optimal model predictive contouring control (MPCC) incorporates safe flight corridor (SFC) constraints at variable horizon steps to enable aggressive yet safe maneuvering, while fully exploiting the MAV's dynamics. We validate the proposed framework extensively on a custom-built LiDAR-based MAV platform. Simulation results demonstrate superior aggressiveness compared to the state of the art, while real-world experiments achieve a peak speed of 18 m/s in a cluttered environment and succeed in 10 consecutive trials from diverse start points.

    "title": "Optimizing the Design of a Simple Three-Sphere Magnetic Microswimmer",
    "summary": "When swimming at low Reynolds numbers, inertial effects are negligible and reciprocal movements cannot induce net motion. Instead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation. Thus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally. Due to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field. The swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy. Thanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery.",

    "title": "Proprioception Enhances Vision Language Model in Generating Captions and Subtask Segmentations for Robot Task",
    "summary": "From the perspective of future developments in robotics, it is crucial to verify whether foundation models trained exclusively on offline data, such as images and language, can understand the robot motion. In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple \"scene\" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM. Simulator experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "title": "From Human Bias to Robot Choice: How Occupational Contexts and Racial Priming Shape Robot Selection",
    "summary": "As artificial agents increasingly integrate into professional environments, fundamental questions have emerged about how societal biases influence human-robot selection decisions. We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts. The results highlight mechanisms through which robotic deployment may unintentionally perpetuate existing social inequalities.",

    "summary": "Volcanic gas emissions are key precursors of eruptive activity. Yet, obtaining accurate near-surface measurements remains hazardous and logistically challenging, motivating the need for autonomous solutions. Limited mobility in rough volcanic terrain has prevented wheeled systems from performing reliable in situ gas measurements, reducing their usefulness as sensing platforms. We present a legged robotic system for autonomous volcanic gas analysis, utilizing the quadruped ANYmal, equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer system. Our modular autonomy stack integrates a mission planning interface, global planner, localization framework, and terrain-aware local navigation. We evaluated the system on Mount Etna across three autonomous missions in varied terrain, achieving successful gas-source detections with autonomy rates of 93-100%. In addition, we conducted a teleoperated mission in which the robot measured natural fumaroles, detecting sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. We discuss lessons learned from the gas-analysis and autonomy perspectives, emphasizing the need for adaptive sensing strategies, tighter integration of global and local planning, and improved hardware design.",

    "summary": "Retargeting human motion to heterogeneous robots is a fundamental challenge in robotics, primarily due to the severe kinematic and dynamic discrepancies between varying embodiments. Existing solutions typically resort to training embodiment-specific models, which scales poorly and fails to exploit shared motion semantics. To address this, we present AdaMorph, a unified neural retargeting framework that enables a single model to adapt human motion to diverse robot morphologies. Our approach treats retargeting as a conditional generation task. We map human motion into a morphology-agnostic latent intent space and utilize a dual-purpose prompting mechanism to condition the generation. Instead of simple input concatenation, we leverage Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) to dynamically modulate the decoder's feature space based on embodiment constraints. Furthermore, we enforce physical plausibility through a curriculum-based training objective that ensures orientation and trajectory consistency via integration. Experimental results on 12 distinct humanoid robots demonstrate that AdaMorph effectively unifies control across heterogeneous topologies, exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to unseen complex motions while preserving the dynamic essence of the source behaviors.",

    "summary": "This work advances the maximum hands-off sparse control framework by developing a robust counterpart for constrained linear systems with parametric uncertainties. The resulting optimal control problem minimizes an $L^{0}$ objective subject to an uncountable, compact family of constraints, and is therefore a nonconvex, nonsmooth robust optimization problem. To address this, we replace the $L^{0}$ objective with its convex $L^{1}$ surrogate and, using a nonsmooth variant of the robust Pontryagin maximum principle, show that the $L^{0}$ and $L^{1}$ formulations have identical sets of optimal solutions -- we call this the robust hands-off principle. Building on this equivalence, we propose an algorithmic framework -- drawing on numerically viable techniques from the semi-infinite robust optimization literature -- to solve the resulting problems. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

    "summary": "Multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing agricultural tasks such as spraying, surveying, and inspection. However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.
