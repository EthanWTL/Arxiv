    "summary": "Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a\npromising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,\nVLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is\nsupervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their\nrepresentational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose\n\\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to\npredict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that\ncompels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.\nWe showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA\narchetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual\ntokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual\nfeatures. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we\nintroduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for\nreal-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a\n680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly\noutperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling\nlaw, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size\nincreases.",

    "summary": "Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most\nexisting architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.\nThis separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal\nreasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use\nthe last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train\nlarge unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands\nsubstantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its\naccessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model\nconditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a\nunified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention\nPooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level\ndetails from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion\ngenerative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion\narchitectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of\nvisual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We\npropose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),\nwhich conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens\ngenerated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the\nalignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning\ncapabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In\naddition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for\ngeneration, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits\ntremendous generalization capabilities.

However, the conventional process for creating and\nanimating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,\nrequiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from\nprofessional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation\nmodels, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars\nfrom a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While\nthese techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer\ncompelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or\nan explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when\nrendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,\nwe build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital\nhumans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,\nMVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and\ngenerates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to\n360 degrees around a target subject.

    "summary": "Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally\nunder-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel\nviews. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,\nvanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether\nthey are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under\nocclusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue\nthat uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views\nand time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited\nvisibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a\nnovel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates\nreliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to\nestimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a\nspatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization.

    "summary": "Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal\nstructure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through\nreductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural\nMRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical\nsophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and\nheterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy\naging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age\ngap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain\nage gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's\npredicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The\nresulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with\nrecent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and\nseverity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their\nmethodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical\npopulations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces\na principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in\ngraph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks\n(GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the\nanatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong\ntheoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust\nestimation of brain age gap predictions.

Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think\nwith images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with\nother tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as\npassive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.\nMost existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where\nimages are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,\nan Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability\nto perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under\nthe think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended\nvision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse\ndomains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our\nevaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective\nintegration of vision and general-purpose tools.

Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the\noriginal sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint\nembedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space.\nBoth approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear\nguidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core\nmechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions\nfor both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process,\ne.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then\ndemonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a\nminimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve\nasymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that\nin scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint\nembedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker\nalignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not\nonly clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the\nempirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging\ndatasets.",

    "summary": "Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety\nconcerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as\nLiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these\nsensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be\nobstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this\ncontext, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables\ncars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are\noccluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness\nMessages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle\ntrajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,\nCooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely\nused motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset\nthat we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to\nassess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach\ndemonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle\ntrajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the\napproach, which highlight opportunities for future research.",

    "summary": "Automatic software verifiers have become increasingly effective at the task\nof checking software against (formal) specifications. Yet, their adoption in\npractice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world\ncode. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal\npostconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function\nnames, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as\nspecifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to\nsuggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to\nbe false alarms.\n  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from\nnatural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the\nprocess, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate\ninformal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of\npostconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and\ncompare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative\npower of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of\nautomatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with\ndifferent LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation\nnl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at\ngenerating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the\ngenerated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from\ncorrect behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional\ncontracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions\nalone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally\nalign well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software\nverifiers to catch real-world bugs.",

In the second stage, we\ndevelop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance\nagent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including\nlong horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key\ndesigns: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and\nturn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level\nplanning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate\nthat ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous\ntraining-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of\n8.4\\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits\nstrong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path\ntoward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for\nfuture embodied AI systems.",

    "summary": "There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to\nautomate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear\nhow algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic\nunderstanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge\nassignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges.\nSpecifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation\nChallenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \\$500,000\nto student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where\nhigh-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based\njudge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),\nand deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against\nhuman expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on\n$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we\nfound no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the\ntwo approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated\n$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an\nexcellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a\nfull week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during\ndeployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level\nmatching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency,\nunderscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human\ndecision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising accuracy in predicting\nsurvey responses and policy preferences, which has increased interest in their\npotential to represent human interests in various domains. Most existing\nresearch has focused on behavioral cloning, effectively evaluating how well\nmodels reproduce individuals' expressed preferences. Drawing on theories of\npolitical representation, we highlight an underexplored design trade-off:\nwhether AI systems should act as delegates, mirroring expressed preferences, or\nas trustees, exercising judgment about what best serves an individual's\ninterests. This trade-off is closely related to issues of LLM sycophancy, where\nmodels can encourage behavior or validate beliefs that may be aligned with a\nuser's short-term preferences, but is detrimental to their long-term interests.\nThrough a series of experiments simulating votes on various policy issues in\nthe U.S. context, we apply a temporal utility framework that weighs short and\nlong-term interests (simulating a trustee role) and compare voting outcomes to\nbehavior-cloning models (simulating a delegate). We find that trustee-style\npredictions weighted toward long-term interests produce policy decisions that\nalign more closely with expert consensus on well-understood issues, but also\nshow greater bias toward models' default stances on topics lacking clear\nagreement. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off in designing AI\nsystems to represent human interests. Delegate models better preserve user\nautonomy but may diverge from well-supported policy positions, while trustee\nmodels can promote welfare on well-understood issues yet risk paternalism and\nbias on subjective topics.",

    "summary": "Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct\nanswering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet\nour experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial\nmode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To\nunderstand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing\ncontrollability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)\nusing think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same\nquestion, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase\nstrategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think\ntraining. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,\ncompared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while\nsignificantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)\nand occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\\texttt{wait}'' (from\n$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500).

However, in domains aiming for carbon\nneutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, current AI-assisted\ndesign automation methods face critical challenges in explainability,\nscalability, and practical usability. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce PHIA (Physics-Informed Autonomous Agent), an LLM-driven system that\nautomates modulation design for power converters in Power Electronics Systems\nwith minimal human intervention. In contrast to traditional pipeline-based\nmethods, PHIA incorporates an LLM-based planning module that interactively\nacquires and verifies design requirements via a user-friendly chat interface.\nThis planner collaborates with physics-informed simulation and optimization\ncomponents to autonomously generate and iteratively refine modulation designs.\nThe interactive interface also supports interpretability by providing textual\nexplanations and visual outputs throughout the design process. Experimental\nresults show that PHIA reduces standard mean absolute error by 63.2% compared\nto the second-best benchmark and accelerates the overall design process by over\n33 times. A user study involving 20 domain experts further confirms PHIA's\nsuperior design efficiency and usability, highlighting its potential to\ntransform industrial design workflows in power electronics.",

At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a\ndual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel\nrepresentations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)\nstream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical\nstack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)\nCross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among\nfeatures within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables\nbidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and\n(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically\nsuppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward\nzero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise.

    "summary": "The practice of fine-tuning AI agents on data from their own\ninteractions--such as web browsing or tool use--, while being a strong general\nrecipe for improving agentic capabilities, also introduces a critical security\nvulnerability within the AI supply chain. In this work, we show that\nadversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed\nhard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such\nthat when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or\nmalicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models\ntargeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of\nfine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces;\n2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into\nwebpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply\nchain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data\nto improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few\nas 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an\nagent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a\nspecific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat\nmodels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prominent safeguards, including two\nguardrail models and one weight-based defense, fail to detect or prevent the\nmalicious behavior.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning\ncapabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories\n(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model\nusing verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating\nhigh-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This\npaper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially\nreduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class\nof problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,\nprocedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in\ncontent such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the\nsolution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the\nsuccess of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable\nmodels to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic\nmatching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral\nevidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of\nrationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,\nwe propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet\neffective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with\ntask-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.\nExperiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR\nperformance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest\nthat large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based\nautomatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning\npatterns.",

Medication\nmanagement is a complex task that requires synthesis of drug formulation and\ncomplete order instructions for safe use. Here, the performance of GPT 4o, an\nLLM available with ChatGPT, was tested for three medication management tasks.\nMethods: GPT-4o performance was tested using three medication tasks:\nidentifying available formulations for a given generic drug name, identifying\ndrug-drug interactions (DDI) for a given medication regimen, and preparing a\nmedication order for a given generic drug name. For each experiment, the models\nraw text response was captured exactly as returned and evaluated using\nclinician evaluation in addition to standard LLM metrics, including Term\nFrequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF IDF) vectors, normalized Levenshtein\nsimilarity, and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE\n1/ROUGE L F1) between each response and its reference string. Results: For the\nfirst task of drug-formulation matching, GPT-4o had 49% accuracy for generic\nmedications being matched to all available formulations, with an average of\n1.23 omissions per medication and 1.14 hallucinations per medication. For the\nsecond task of drug-drug interaction identification, the accuracy was 54.7% for\nidentifying the DDI pair. For the third task, GPT-4o generated order sentences\ncontaining no medication or abbreviation errors in 65.8% of cases.

    "summary": "Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their\nconstrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.\nExisting working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic\nmechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we\nreframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We\npropose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages\nits working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a\nunified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement\nlearning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under\ngiven resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the\nstandard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,\nleading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt\nthe causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making\nthose methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,\nDynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end\nreinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and\napplying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our\nresults demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory\nmanagement in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational\nconsumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context\ncuration strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.",

However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks\nis limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes\nsevere GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to\nmitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor\nand all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global\nsynchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution\nof trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.\nOur key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep\nthrough trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each\ntrajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL\npost-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace\nglobal updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter\nservice. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,\nallowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the\nactor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates\nlong-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation\nthroughput.

    "title": "Designing Tools with Control Confidence",
    "summary": "Prehistoric humans invented stone tools for specialized tasks by not just\nmaximizing the tool's immediate goal-completion accuracy, but also increasing\ntheir confidence in the tool for later use under similar settings. This factor\ncontributed to the increased robustness of the tool, i.e., the least\nperformance deviations under environmental uncertainties. However, the current\nautonomous tool design frameworks solely rely on performance optimization,\nwithout considering the agent's confidence in tool use for repeated use. Here,\nwe take a step towards filling this gap by i) defining an optimization\nframework for task-conditioned autonomous hand tool design for robots, where\nii) we introduce a neuro-inspired control confidence term into the optimization\nroutine that helps the agent to design tools with higher robustness. Through\nrigorous simulations using a robotic arm, we show that tools designed with\ncontrol confidence as the objective function are more robust to environmental\nuncertainties during tool use than a pure accuracy-driven objective. We further\nshow that adding control confidence to the objective function for tool design\nprovides a balance between the robustness and goal accuracy of the designed\ntools under control perturbations. Finally, we show that our CMAES-based\nevolutionary optimization strategy for autonomous tool design outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art optimizers by designing the optimal tool within the fewest\niterations.

    "summary": "Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem\nwhere the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively\nselecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from\nretrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited\ntask-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single\npredetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we\nformalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies\nacross various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of\ni) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an\nuncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional\nmutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive\npre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for\ntasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with\nretrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,\neliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular\nbenchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly\nunder scarce labels and high missingness.",

In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of\nknowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional\nperspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which\nprovides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ\nhypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand\nknowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the\nbreadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants\nand analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings\ndemonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer\nin some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less\npronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise\nknowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we\nidentify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to\nthe student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.\nAcross 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings\nshow that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and\nmore as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.",

    "summary": "With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into\nopen-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical\ntask for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on\nstatistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between\nLLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in\nreal-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to\nparaphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic\ndiversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose\nStyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits\nLLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify\nstylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and\ncontinuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,\nStyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and\nLLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables\naccurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access\nto model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five\ndiverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,\ndemonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain\naccuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing\nbaselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial\nperturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative\nanalysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for\ndistinguishing machine-generated text.

Existing methods align items' side content with\ncollaborative information to transfer collaborative signals from\nhigh-popularity items to cold-start items. However, these methods fail to\naccount for the asymmetry between collaboration and content, nor the\nfine-grained differences among items. To address these issues, we propose\nSMILE, an item representation enhancement approach based on fused alignment of\nsemantic IDs. Specifically, we use RQ-OPQ encoding to quantize item content and\ncollaborative information, followed by a two-step alignment: RQ encoding\ntransfers shared collaborative signals across items, while OPQ encoding learns\ndifferentiated information of items.

Yet large\nlanguage models (LLMs) remain largely static after pre-training, causing their\ninternal knowledge to become outdated and limiting their utility in\ntime-sensitive web applications. To bridge this gap between dynamic knowledge\nand static models, a prevalent approach is to enhance LLMs with KGs.

Furthermore, we outline how\nthis framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and\ntemporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize\nthe emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a\ngradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively\nproducing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In\ncontrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our\ngene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from\nfull adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling\nunique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual\ncooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents\nbehave adversarially towards each other.

To\naddress this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior\nthrough the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise\nrepresentation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal\nphenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical\nlayer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden\nrepresentations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we\nintroduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates\nrepresentation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query\ninfluences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9\ncontemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently\nemerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This\noffers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in\nLVLMs.",

    "summary": "Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures\nachieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for\nrecent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization\nmethods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces\nand the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine\nlearning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review\nframes ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of\nrepresentation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and\ninput-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in\nthe solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates\noptimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact,\nlatent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient\nglobal exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique\ntrade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design\ndiscovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization\nwith data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve\nscalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting\nopen challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management,\ngeometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints,\nand advancements in multiphysics co-designs.",

    "summary": "Recent studies have explored the deployment of privacy-preserving deep neural\nnetworks utilizing homomorphic encryption (HE), especially for private\ninference (PI). Many works have attempted the approximation-aware training\n(AAT) approach in PI, changing the activation functions of a model to\nlow-degree polynomials that are easier to compute on HE by allowing model\nretraining. However, due to constraints in the training environment, it is\noften necessary to consider post-training approximation (PTA), using the\npre-trained parameters of the existing plaintext model without retraining.\nExisting PTA studies have uniformly approximated the activation function in all\nlayers to a high degree to mitigate accuracy loss from approximation, leading\nto significant time consumption. This study proposes an optimized layerwise\napproximation (OLA), a systematic framework that optimizes both accuracy loss\nand time consumption by using different approximation polynomials for each\nlayer in the PTA scenario. For efficient approximation, we reflect the\nlayerwise impact on the classification accuracy by considering the actual input\ndistribution of each activation function while constructing the optimization\nproblem. Additionally, we provide a dynamic programming technique to solve the\noptimization problem and achieve the optimized layerwise degrees in polynomial\ntime. As a result, the OLA method reduces inference times for the ResNet-20\nmodel and the ResNet-32 model by 3.02 times and 2.82 times, respectively,\ncompared to prior state-of-the-art implementations employing uniform degree\npolynomials. Furthermore, we successfully classified CIFAR-10 by replacing the\nGELU function in the ConvNeXt model with only 3-degree polynomials using the\nproposed method, without modifying the backbone model.",

A\nhierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,\nand document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment.

    "summary": "Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific\nunderstanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated\nsignificant advancements across various domains including translation and\nsummarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current\nupfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,\nproposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating\npsychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing\nconsciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial\nconsciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based\non the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters\nwith different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several\nattributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's\nartificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct\nsituations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and\nlogical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and\nthe final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier\nclassification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and\nqualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated\nconsciousness, although the difference in response between different characters\nand consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed\nmodels incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead\nto building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid\nconsciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for\nimproving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.",

In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves\nas the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as\nsecondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an\nestimator of the importance weights.

    "summary": "With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between\norganizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth\nof various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing\nimpractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical\nFederated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure\ncollaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers\nfrom low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.\nSpecifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,\nwhile resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder\nefficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a\nnovel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for\ntwo-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL\nleverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data\nparallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical\nasynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system\nefficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource\nand data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on\nparticipants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal\nhyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to\ndemonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with\nsecurity protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five\nbenchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared\nto state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2\n\\sim 7\\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational\nresource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,\nproducing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also\nheightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no\nprior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In\nthis paper, we introduce \\dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector\nrobustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired\nwith their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large\nperformance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some\nstate-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation\nto the \\textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative\nin general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized\ntext. Based on this finding, we propose \\method, a simple and reliable way to\npredict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \\method\nidentifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs\nprobe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector\ndependence. Our experiments show that \\method can accurately predict both the\ndirection and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\\% correlation\nwith the actual performance gaps.

However, the impartiality of\nthese AI \"judges\" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation\ncriteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we\nsystematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,\nGPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11\ntypes of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that\nstate-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally\nassigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a\ndetailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that\nfine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly\ndegrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We\nalso discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a\nchallenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an\nopen-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.\nFinally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and\nreliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.",

We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective\noptimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima\noften emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data\naugmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better\ngeneralisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a\nrange of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation\ntend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety\nmetrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than\nflatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can\nreflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),\ncalling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.",

    "summary": "Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building\nvision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to\neffective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D\nsignals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the\nspatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In\nthis paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D\ninputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,\nand (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and\noutput spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a\nscalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability\nto predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments\nshow the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and\neffectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across\nthree simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate\nfrom 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better\nperformance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average\nsuccess rate from 56.7% to 64.0%.

Despite its success in the\nsingle-agent setting, offline multi-agent RL remains a challenge, especially in\ncompetitive games. Firstly, unaware of the game structure, it is impossible to\ninteract with the opponents and conduct a major learning paradigm, self-play,\nfor competitive games. Secondly, real-world datasets cannot cover all the state\nand action space in the game, resulting in barriers to identifying Nash\nequilibrium (NE). To address these issues, this paper introduces OFF-FSP, the\nfirst practical model-free offline RL algorithm for competitive games. We start\nby simulating interactions with various opponents by adjusting the weights of\nthe fixed dataset with importance sampling. This technique allows us to learn\nthe best responses to different opponents and employ the Offline Self-Play\nlearning framework. To overcome the challenge of partial coverage, we combine\nthe single-agent offline RL method with Fictitious Self-Play (FSP) to\napproximate NE by constraining the approximate best responses away from\nout-of-distribution actions. Experiments on matrix games, extensive-form poker,\nand board games demonstrate that OFF-FSP achieves significantly lower\nexploitability than state-of-the-art baselines.

    "summary": "The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases\non social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world\nnetworks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing\nchallenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that\nsimulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language\nmodels (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive\ntransfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,\nmeanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking\ninterpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple\ntopics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation\n(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with\nLLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,\nincorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic\ntopic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable\nperspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,\nvarying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to\nassess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show\nthat multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively\ncorrelated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit\nthem, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource\ncompetition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically\nsimulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,\nand capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and\nsystem stability.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on\nconditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that\nrely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous\nflow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the\ndirect regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in\nthe context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly\nemerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from\ninherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our\nframework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their\ncorresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without\nrequiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while\nutilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.\nThese results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool\nfor MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in reasoning\ntasks, including mathematical reasoning and logical deduction.

In this study, we present the first comprehensive\nanalysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance.\nSpecifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across\nsix graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1)\nordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph\nstructures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across\ndifferent tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely\nrelated to the inherent characteristics of tasks.

To address this gap, this survey provides the first\ncomprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,\nestablishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this\ntransformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over\n1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining\ncritical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding\nagent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We\nfirst introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a\nConstrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic\nrelationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.\nBuilding upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing\npractices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,\nIterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and\nContext-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in\nthis domain.

    "summary": "Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing\nattention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models\nwhile keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients,\nensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often\nemployed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global\nmodel. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not\nalways yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The\nreason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,\nwhile being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for\nthe knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous\nFederated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature\ninformation via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous\nmodels better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge\ndistillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to\nmaintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align\nthe features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize\nthe projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and\nthus maximize the distilled knowledge.

    "summary": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired\nresearchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,\npotentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous\nstudies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,\ntheir dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between\nresearch and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this\nstudy, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and\nresearch processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential\nrisks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a\nresearch agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,\nwhich assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct\nhuman annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based\nreviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores\nfor LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than\nhuman-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored\npapers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple\nrevisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM\nreviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and\nan aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and\nequity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are\ndeployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,\nrevisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human\nevaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for\nearly-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.",

There are two variants for this pre-training. In the local context-only\nbase scheme (CiteBART-Base), the citation token in a local context is masked to\nlearn to predict the citation. The global version (CiteBART-Global) extends the\nlocal context with the citing paper's title and abstract to enrich the learning\nsignal. CiteBART-Global achieves state-of-the-art performance on LCR benchmarks\nexcept for the FullTextPeerRead dataset, which is quite small to see the\nadvantage of generative pre-training.

    "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across\nvarious tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily\nlarge model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory\nfootprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but\nnot all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep\narchitectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted\ncomputation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which\nin turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.\nTo address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which\nprovide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we\npropose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which\nbegins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally\nincreases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process\nuntil the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the\ngiven datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and\ninference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational\nefficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show\nthat the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve\nup to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a\ncompetitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.",

    "summary": "Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving\nremains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to\nidentify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its\ncorresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current\nretrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using\nthe informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:\ninformal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on\nthe underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel\nframework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into\nsmaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval\nof premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT\nretrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in\nformalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,\nConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise\nretrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on\nProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the\nout-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and\n42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that\nretrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on\nmodel-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive\nretrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.",

The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs\nmay look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking.

Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves\ndifficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the \"right\"\nsubdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using\nAI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level\nasymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns\nout to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a\ncombination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to\nsuggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a\nverification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question\nposed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help\nprove intricate asymptotic inequalities.

In\nthis work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive\nalternative to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion\naction decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling\nthrough an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We\nintegrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO\nbenchmark.

Through the\ndesign and systematic evaluation of alternate projection blocks, we show that\nbetter-designed final projections positively impact the downstream performance\nof ColBERT models.

    "summary": "A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large\nlanguage models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood\nfunctions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating\ncorresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods\napproximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via\ncustomized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all\nMC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms\nin the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint\nrestricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations\nand ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose \\emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient\nRL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the\nELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key\nproperties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term\ndepends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation\nacross samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the\nvalue and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based\nobjective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for\nthe original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC\nsample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved\nRL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.\nExperiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for\ndLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

    "summary": "Multimodal reasoning with vision-language models (VLMs) often suffers from\nhallucinations, as models tend to generate explanations after only a\nsuperficial inspection of the image. We present \\textbf{CoRGI}(\\textbf{C}hain\n\\textbf{o}f \\textbf{R}easoning with \\textbf{G}rounded \\textbf{I}nsights), a\nframework that enhances reasoning reliability through post-hoc verification of\nchain-of-thought outputs. Given a VLM-generated rationale, CoRGI decomposes it\ninto step-wise statements, grounds each step in visual evidence, and filters or\ncorrects unsupported claims before producing the final answer. Experiments on\nfive challenging benchmark-VCR, ScienceQA, MMMU, MathVista, and\nHallusionBenc-demonstrate that CoRGI consistently improves both answer accuracy\nand explanation faithfulness across multiple VLM backbones, including\nQwen-2.5VL, LLaVA-1.6, and Gemma3-12B. Beyond quantitative gains, qualitative\nanalyses further illustrate how the verification process reduces hallucination\nand strengthens interpretability, suggesting that post-hoc visual grounding is\na promising direction for building more trustworthy and transparent multimodal\nreasoning systems.",

We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model\nand representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that\nrestricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy\nensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition\nand reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, \"deep\"\nanalogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on\nthese results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that\ncouples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates.

    "summary": "Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records.\nThey are the most widespread information across populations and diseases, and\nserve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment\ndecisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often treated as\nauxiliaries in model design, with limited attention being paid to learning\ntheir representations. This study explored the development of a General\nDemographic Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational model tailored to\ndemographic attributes, focusing on age and gender. The model is pre-trained\nand evaluated using datasets with diverse diseases and populations compositions\nfrom different geographic regions. The composition of GDP architecture was\nexplored through examining combinations of ordering approaches and encoding\nmethods to transform tabular demographic inputs into effective latent\nembeddings. Results demonstrate the feasibility of GDP to generalize across\ntask, diseases, and populations. In detailed composition, the sequential\nordering substantially improves model performance in discrimination,\ncalibration, and the corresponding information gain at each decision tree\nsplit, particularly in diseases where age and gender contribute significantly\nto risk stratification. Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold\nrelatively low predictive value, GDP enhances the representational importance,\nincreasing their influence in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings\nsuggest that foundation models for tabular demographic attributes offer a\npromising direction for improving predictive performance in healthcare\napplications.",

    "summary": "Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on\ntheir ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously\nacquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and\nWebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily\nrely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static\ntext content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve\ndiverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing.\nIn this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves\ncomplex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates\ndirectly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser\nactions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and\nRejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities.\nDespite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent\nachieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally,\nwe introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across\nsteps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon\ntasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\\% improvement over\nSearch-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle.

    "summary": "Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,\ndata, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory\nefficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where\ntokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese\nModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware\n32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the\nembedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking\ncurriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)\na two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to\n8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a\ndamped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We\npre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and\nCosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong\nChinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves\nhigh long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,\nreflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe\nretrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:\nfine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking\n(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.\nUnder this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding\non SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated\npairs.

However, these\nsystems still struggle when stylistic requirements are implicitly represented\nby a set of examples, such as texts produced by a specific human translator. In\nthis work, we explore various strategies for personalizing automatically\ngenerated translations when few examples are available, with a focus on the\nchallenging domain of literary translation. We begin by determining the\nfeasibility of the task and how style information is encoded within model\nrepresentations. Then, we evaluate various prompting strategies and\ninference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a\npersonalized style, with a particular focus on contrastive steering with sparse\nautoencoder (SAE) latents to identify salient personalization properties. We\ndemonstrate that contrastive SAE steering yields robust style conditioning and\ntranslation quality, resulting in higher inference-time computational\nefficiency than prompting approaches. We further examine the impact of steering\non model activations, finding that layers encoding personalization properties\nare impacted similarly by prompting and SAE steering, suggesting a similar\nmechanism at play.",

To achieve this, we mined 15 essential dimensions for\nhigh-quality prompts from advanced users and curated a multi-turn dataset.\nThrough training on this dataset, DialPrompt improves user-centricity by\nallowing users to perceive and control the creation process of TIS prompts.\nExperiments indicate that DialPrompt improves significantly in user-centricity\nscore compared with existing approaches while maintaining a competitive quality\nof synthesized images.

Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic\ndifferentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,\nwhich was never intended for AI.

On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack\nscalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a\nlanguage that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a\nfundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,\nbased on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are\nessentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how\nto elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in\ntensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and\ngraphical models.

This availability has\nmotivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.\n  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional\ntraining, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically\nactivate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy\nor insufficiency that degrade performance.\n  In this paper, we propose \\texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that\nperforms adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural\nproperties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank\nparameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,\n\\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their\nROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the\ntoken level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative\nROCs.\n  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \\texttt{HiLoRA} selects the\nmost relevant LoRAs with high probability.\n  Extensive experiments show that \\texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial\nimprovements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\\small\n$55\\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference\nthroughput.",

Bandwidth estimation for real-time\ncommunications remains an open challenge due to rapidly evolving network\narchitectures, increasingly complex protocol stacks, and the difficulty of\ndefining QoE metrics that reliably improve user experience. In this work, we\npropose a deployed, human-in-the-loop, data-driven framework for bandwidth\nestimation to address these challenges. Our approach begins with training\nobjective QoE reward models derived from subjective user evaluations to measure\naudio and video quality in real-time video conferencing systems. Subsequently,\nwe collect roughly $1$M network traces with objective QoE rewards from\nreal-world Microsoft Teams calls to curate a bandwidth estimation training\ndataset. We then introduce a novel distributional offline reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithm to train a neural-network-based bandwidth estimator\naimed at improving QoE for users. Our real-world A/B test demonstrates that the\nproposed approach reduces the subjective poor call ratio by $11.41\\%$ compared\nto the baseline bandwidth estimator. Furthermore, the proposed offline RL\nalgorithm is benchmarked on D4RL tasks to demonstrate its generalization beyond\nbandwidth estimation.",

Many studies\nassess MLIR performance in isolated settings, limiting their applicability to\nreal-world scenarios. In this work, we leverage the unique characteristics of\nthe Quranic multilingual corpus to examine the optimal strategies to develop an\nad-hoc IR system for the Islamic domain that is designed to satisfy users'\ninformation needs in multiple languages.

    "summary": "Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with\nexternal sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.\nCentral to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent\nunderstanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the\nsolution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents\noften suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,\nlose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive\nactions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)\ntraining fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address\nthis issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop\n$\\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief\ndeviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative\ntails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\\mathbf{T^3}$\nsystematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,\n$\\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and\nfinal performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by\nroughly 25%.

Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn\nquestion answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of\nmedical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and\nauthority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for\nsystematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.\nOur approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading\ninitial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are\nchallenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that\nseparates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).\nUsing controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five\nstate-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under\nshallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn\nsettings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude\nSonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often\nmore harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across\nmodels and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.\nFurther compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing\nadditional performance drops under repeated interventions while others\npartially recovering or even improving.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological\nstructures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in\ncapturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates\nboth while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This\npaper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal\nConvolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these\nlimitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting\nhierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core\ninnovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,\nimplemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT).

    "summary": "Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks.\nWhile PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language\nmodels (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to\nboth correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical\napplications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled\ndata for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose\nDisagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to\noptimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\\tau$) in post-hoc confidence\ncalibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by\nprediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their\nconfidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence\nunderestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a\nlarger $\\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by\nselectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively\ndecoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an\noverly large $\\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples,\nimproving calibration performance.

    "title": "MoRA: On-the-fly Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation Framework for\n  LLM-based Multi-Modal Molecular Assistant",
    "summary": "Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models\n(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal\nalignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or\nadding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main\nlimitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular\ninputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural\nfeatures; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to\ncatastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In\nthis paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an\ninstance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule\non-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)\nthat produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input\nmolecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,\nallowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular\ninput, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction\nand molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation\noutperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative\nimprovement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for\nquantum property prediction.

    "summary": "Whole-body audio-driven avatar pose and expression generation is a critical\ntask for creating lifelike digital humans and enhancing the capabilities of\ninteractive virtual agents, with wide-ranging applications in virtual reality,\ndigital entertainment, and remote communication. Existing approaches often\ngenerate audio-driven facial expressions and gestures independently, which\nintroduces a significant limitation: the lack of seamless coordination between\nfacial and gestural elements, resulting in less natural and cohesive\nanimations. To address this limitation, we propose AsynFusion, a novel\nframework that leverages diffusion transformers to achieve harmonious\nexpression and gesture synthesis. The proposed method is built upon a\ndual-branch DiT architecture, which enables the parallel generation of facial\nexpressions and gestures. Within the model, we introduce a Cooperative\nSynchronization Module to facilitate bidirectional feature interaction between\nthe two modalities, and an Asynchronous LCM Sampling strategy to reduce\ncomputational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that AsynFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance\nin generating real-time, synchronized whole-body animations, consistently\noutperforming existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent\nharmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks\nposed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and\nrelying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come\nfrom non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,\nself-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly\ninfluence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,\nescalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce\nConstructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects\nagainst malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe\nand helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic\nanticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and\ninterpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.\nOy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high\ngeneral capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong\nconstructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the\nStrata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels.

    "summary": "The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical\napplications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the\ncomplexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real\nclinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc\nreview of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,\ncontext-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational\nneeds of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn\nevaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical\nknowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge\ngraph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module\nretrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby\nendowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational\nbehavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source\nresources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)\nan in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is\nassessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,\nand safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,\ntask-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle\nbehavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional\nevaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English\nmedical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional\nlanguages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual\nsupport and domain-specific applicability.",

To\naddress this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a\ndeployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications\nand weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application\ndomains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.\nOur evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not\nconsistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not\nguarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision\nsupport but worse in education.

The key\nto solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative\nsubsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series\nclassification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning\nfor Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel\nDual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely\nthrough three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy\ncombines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal\nenhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based\nsoft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative\npatterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,\nand (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules\nfusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and\nmulti-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets.

Meta-learning-based sample reweighting\nmitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its\nbehavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a\nrigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show\nthat its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase\nthat amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses\nconflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward\nzero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in\nwhich noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a\nsimilarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together\nwith clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where\nthe clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and\nmeta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we\npropose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates\nmean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable\nperformance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization.

    "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in\nimage generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual\nproperty remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate\ntraining data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and\npruning weights responsible for triggering verbatim training data replication,\nbased on the assumption that memorization can be localized. We challenge this\nassumption and demonstrate that, even after such pruning, small perturbations\nto the text embeddings of previously mitigated prompts can re-trigger data\nreplication, revealing the fragility of such defenses. Our further analysis\nthen provides multiple indications that memorization is indeed not inherently\nlocal: (1) replication triggers for memorized images are distributed throughout\ntext embedding space; (2) embeddings yielding the same replicated image produce\ndivergent model activations; and (3) different pruning methods identify\ninconsistent sets of memorization-related weights for the same image. Finally,\nwe show that bypassing the locality assumption enables more robust mitigation\nthrough adversarial fine-tuning. These findings provide new insights into the\nnature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and inform the development of more\nreliable mitigations against DM memorization.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model\nrouting harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the\nmost suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance\nrelies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically\nrequires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model\ncapabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded\nand projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to\nreconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the\nrouter's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query\nset, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model\nperformance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nrouting performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.\nMoreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without\nretraining the router.

At present, however, evaluation processes are rather\ntechnical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.\nConsequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable\nguide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review\nof 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and\napplication contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic\noverview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on\nhuman users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered\ndesign (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific\ncharacteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI\nexpertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an\nextension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of\nour results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important\nfinding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,\nwhich together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction\nof evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,\ninterpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with\ntheir specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed.

However,\nexisting benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,\ncreating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We\nintroduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven\nirregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine\ndistinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,\nconstraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we\nintroduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal\ntime series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.\nIMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text\nfusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both\nrecency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time\nseries data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and\nIMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under\nreal-world conditions.

To counter the\nharmful effects of such technology, the Image Difference Captioning (IDC) task\naims to describe the differences between two images. While this task is\nsuccessfully handled for simple 3D rendered images, it struggles on real-world\nimages. The reason is twofold: the training data-scarcity, and the difficulty\nto capture fine-grained differences between complex images. To address those\nissues, we propose in this paper a simple yet effective framework to both adapt\nexisting image captioning models to the IDC task and augment IDC datasets. We\nintroduce BLIP2IDC, an adaptation of BLIP2 to the IDC task at low computational\ncost, and show it outperforms two-streams approaches by a significant margin on\nreal-world IDC datasets. We also propose to use synthetic augmentation to\nimprove the performance of IDC models in an agnostic fashion. We show that our\nsynthetic augmentation strategy provides high quality data, leading to a\nchallenging new dataset well-suited for IDC named Syned1.",

    "summary": "Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential\nintermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating\nissues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully\nhand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,\noften failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we\naddress these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,\nperformance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU\nformulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing\nresponse length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies\nLagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.\nAs a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through\nthree approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)\ntruncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing\ngradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces\noutput length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to\nDeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a\nrange of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across\nboth domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching\nthe algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.",

We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training\nplatform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators.

In experiments, PolySim\nsubstantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for\nexample, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim\nbaseline.

We provide structured discussion and\nanalysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark\nresults (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger\nbaselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models\nand PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and\nwe discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling\nto even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a\none-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA\nmodels and efficient fine-tuning strategies.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in\nscientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science\nremain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a\ncomprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the\nessential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a\nstructured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science\nquestions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier\ndifficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each\nquestion. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise\nerror analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in\nnumerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the\nhighest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on\ncollege-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of\nMatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic\nchain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no\nsingle method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze\nperformance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and\naccuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,\nanalyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the\ninfluence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a\ncomprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the\nscientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.",

    "summary": "The large language model (LLM) has achieved significant success across\nvarious domains. However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal\ntheory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language,\nmaking it difficult for LLM to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal\nmethods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLM's\nability to apply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically\ntabular, while LLM excels in handling natural language data, creating a\nstructural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. To\naddress these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an\nagent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems.\nThe causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tool\nmodule, the causal agent calls Python code and uses the encapsulated causal\nfunction module to align tabular data with natural language. In the reasoning\nmodule, the causal agent performs reasoning through multiple iterations with\nthe tools. In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary\ninstance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To\nverify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a Causal Tabular\nQuestion Answer (CausalTQA) benchmark consisting of four levels of causal\nproblems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect\nlevel. CausalTQA consists of about 1.4K for these four levels questions. Causal\nagent demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with\naccuracy rates all above 80\\%. Through verification on the real-world dataset\nQRData, the causal agent is 6\\% higher than the original SOTA.

Remarkably, our result demonstrates a\nsurprising separation between the case of goods and the case of chores, because\ndeciding whether graphs containing only goods have EFX orientations was shown\nto be NP-complete by Christodoulou et al.

    "summary": "Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.\nGiven a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a\nbudgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some\nunlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore\nbudgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)\ncensored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's\ntime-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored\ninstance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from\n(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about\none more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or\nperhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data\ncollection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to\nuncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data\ncollection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We\nprovide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply\nstate-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the\nrespective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and\ntime complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning\nmethod BatchBALD.

We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax\nfunction, which creates \"Artificial Certainty\" by collapsing ambiguous\nattention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty\ninformation at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,\nwhich replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based\non evidential theory. CAM produces a \"credal set\" (a set of distributions)\ninstead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring\nmodel uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as\nevidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers\nstandard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,\nrepresenting ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies\nout-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces\nconfident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a\nnew architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that\nintegrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a\nfoundation for more reliable AI.",

However, most\nexisting frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web\nautomation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,\nmulti-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with\ncustomized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial\nreasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools\nuniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different\ngeospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level\nplanner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to\nspecialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then\ndesign a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs\nadaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the\nquery, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)\noperate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces\ncognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise\ncoordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse\ngeospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and\nMapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented\nand agentic baselines.

Current LLM alignment methods,\nhowever, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to\nreliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with\nthree key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a\ntarget-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a\nlightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final\nattribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM\noutputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden\nrepresentations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute\nintensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over\nattribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment.

    "title": "Can LLMs Reconcile Knowledge Conflicts in Counterfactual Reasoning",
    "summary": "Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in\ntheir parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive\ntasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter\nsituations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or\nunfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine\nknowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of\ncounterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop\nreasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual\nreasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge.\nMoreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill\ncounterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored\nparametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of\ncurrent LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.",

    "summary": "Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing\nthem with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:\nconventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM\nscale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We\nrevisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce\nAsymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable\nframework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in\nlarge-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each\ntrained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while\npreserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust\nestimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy\nupdate: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add\nlittle learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy\nregularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source\ndata with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability\nand performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,\nachieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about\nthree percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without\nadditional tricks.

    "title": "Diffusion Language Models Know the Answer Before Decoding",
    "summary": "Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to\nautoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible\ntoken orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop\nsampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet\npowerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing\nspeedup techniques.

    "summary": "End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive\nconversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional\npipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal\nthrough systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input\nperformance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between\nspeech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality\ngap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and\nspeech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech\nand text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction\n(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean\ndistance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly\ncorrelated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous\ntoken-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is\nobserved. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify\ntoken-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the\nmodality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on\ncritical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These\nstrategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.\nOur study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap\nand alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological\nguidance for future optimization.",

    "summary": "Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for\nmodeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely\non self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This\nignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires\ninductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or\nrandom walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such\ntask-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects\nthat hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly\nincorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for\ndomain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which\nnaturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any\ngraph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance\nacross language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7\npoints, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph\nBenchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's\nefficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a\nlinear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical\nrelaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific\nheuristics.

We address a more realistic and challenging\nsetting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only\n\"one life\" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We\nintroduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through\nconditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming\nframework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,\nactivating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph\nthat routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding\nscaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,\nhierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with\nsparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding\nconstraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state\nranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible\nones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that\nclosely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,\nour reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,\nobject-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on\nthat state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from\nminimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23\nscenarios tested.

    "summary": "The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to\ndiverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as\nstochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and\ncryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling\nrandomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers\neffectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for\nhandling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We\ndesigned a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence\nan LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to\nexternal tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and\nprompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including\ngenerating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,\nshuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the\nNIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate\noutputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is\ninconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The\nanalysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where\nimprovement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving\nrandomness",

    "summary": "Operations research (OR) is a core methodology that supports complex system\ndecision-making, with broad applications in transportation, supply chain\nmanagement, and production scheduling. However, traditional approaches that\nrely on expert-driven modeling and manual parameter tuning often struggle with\nlarge-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems, limiting scalability and\nreal-time applicability. Large language models (LLMs), with capabilities in\nsemantic understanding, structured generation, and reasoning control, offer new\nopportunities to overcome these challenges. They can translate natural language\nproblem descriptions into mathematical models or executable code, generate\nheuristics, evolve algorithms, and directly solve optimization tasks. This\nshifts the paradigm from human-driven processes to intelligent human-AI\ncollaboration. This paper systematically reviews progress in applying LLMs to\nOR, categorizing existing methods into three pathways: automatic modeling,\nauxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It also examines evaluation\nbenchmarks and domain-specific applications, and highlights key challenges,\nincluding unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented research, limited\ngeneralization and interpretability, insufficient evaluation systems, and\nbarriers to industrial deployment. Finally, it outlines potential research\ndirections. Overall, LLMs demonstrate strong potential to reshape the OR\nparadigm by enhancing interpretability, adaptability, and scalability, paving\nthe way for next-generation intelligent optimization systems.",

    "summary": "Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on\ntrajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal\ninconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting\nindividual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility\nbehavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets\nencompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,\nwe present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human\nMobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized\nbehavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained\nanomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD\nlearns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location\nmeaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in\nindividual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware\nmodeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal\nactivity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison\nwith consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior\nclustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts\nand deviations from established routines but also the identification of\nindividuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By\nlearning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances\nanomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.",

    "summary": "Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for enhancing\nvision-language navigation (VLN) performance, and simultaneously mitigate the\ndomain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these\napproaches predominantly adopt straightforward input-output mapping paradigms,\ncausing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions\nunexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve\nboth navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity\nof the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to\noverfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. To address these issues,\nwe propose EvolveNav, a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning paradigm that\nrealizes adaptable and generalizable navigational reasoning for boosting\nLLM-based vision-language Navigation. Specifically, EvolveNav involves a\ntwo-stage training process: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we\ntrain the model with curated formalized CoT labels to first activate the\nmodel's navigational reasoning capabilities, and simultaneously increase the\nreasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is\niteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels\nto enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also\ndesigned to encourage the model to learn correct reasoning patterns by\ncontrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results under both task-specific and\ncross-task training paradigms demonstrate the consistent superiority of\nEvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches on various popular benchmarks,\nincluding R2R, REVERIE, CVDN, and SOON.

To address this issue, domain generalization\napproaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on\nunseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning\nhas proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning\nsamples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many\nexisting methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant\nrepresentations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics\nembedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we\nposit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess\ndomain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the\ndirect strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits\nfeatures at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the\ndiverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature\nlevels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE\nminimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively\nreduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and\nspectral features for sleep stage classification.

In\ndoing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --\nthere is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI\nagents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?\nHow does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training\ndataset size?\n  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI\nAgents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and\nhighlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.\nIn doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to\ntransductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the\ndistribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce\nthe time needed to find solutions to new tasks.\n  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role\nof information in learning is about reduction of time rather than\nreconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a\nuniversal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their\nalgorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the\nobserved power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show\nthat scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on\nbenchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone\nsuper-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can\nbehave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.\nInstead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning\nmodels is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly\nconsidered.",

    "summary": "Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.\nExisting statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly\nacross events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models\n(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to\ngeography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)\nthat grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire\ndetections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,\ndemographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,\nassembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched\ncontext enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation\nrecommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further\nreinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental\nupdates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple\nLLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.\nThe proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and\nhurricanes.",

    "summary": "Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for\nclassification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as\nrobustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has\nbeen largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational\ncost severely limits scalability.

In\nthis work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in\nvisual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for\nstudying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we\nintroduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a\nsuperior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly\nimproving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method\nexhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods.

Methods: A systematic\nmethodology for paper selection, data extraction, and feature analysis is used\nto comprehensively review 238 articles published from 2019 to 2025 and\navailable from major academic databases. Results: Generative pretrained\ntransformer models dominate current applications (67.3%), but research remains\nunevenly distributed across RE phases, with analysis (30.0%) and elicitation\n(22.1%) receiving the most attention, and management (6.8%) underexplored.\nThree core challenges: reproducibility (66.8%), hallucinations (63.4%), and\ninterpretability (57.1%) form a tightly interlinked triad affecting trust and\nconsistency. Strong correlations (35% cooccurrence) indicate these challenges\nmust be addressed holistically. Industrial adoption remains nascent, with over\n90% of studies corresponding to early stage development and only 1.3% reaching\nproduction level integration. Conclusions: Evaluation practices show maturity\ngaps, limited tool and dataset availability, and fragmented benchmarking\napproaches.

Despite recent\nadvances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures\nbased on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static\ndecomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion\nmechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To\nexplicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel\nDynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch\nDecomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale\nRouting MoE block (ASR-MoE).

    "summary": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals found in products like\nnon-stick cookware, are unfortunately persistent environmental pollutants with\nsevere health risks. Accurately mapping PFAS contamination is crucial for\nguiding targeted remediation efforts and protecting public and environmental\nhealth, yet detection across large regions remains challenging due to the cost\nof testing and the difficulty of simulating their spread. In this work, we\nintroduce FOCUS, a geospatial deep learning framework with a label noise-aware\nloss function, to predict PFAS contamination in surface water over large\nregions. By integrating hydrological flow data, land cover information, and\nproximity to known PFAS sources, our approach leverages both spatial and\nenvironmental context to improve prediction accuracy. We evaluate the\nperformance of our approach through extensive ablation studies, robustness\nanalysis, real-world validation, and comparative analyses against baselines\nlike sparse segmentation, as well as existing scientific methods, including\nKriging and pollutant transport simulations. Results and expert feedback\nhighlight our framework's potential for scalable PFAS monitoring.",

    "summary": "Accuracy remains a standard metric for evaluating AI systems, but it offers\nlimited insight into how models arrive at their solutions. In this work, we\nintroduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to\nprobe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use.\nBrainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with\nmultiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight\nor a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language\nmodels (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on\ncorrectness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We\ninvestigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the\nbrainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2)\ngenerating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting\nsolutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of\nsolutions; and (5) making use of hints. We find that LLMs are in many cases\nable to find creative, insightful solutions to brainteasers, suggesting that\nthey capture some of the capacities needed to solve novel problems in creative\nways. Nonetheless, there also remain situations where they rely on brute force\ndespite the availability of more efficient, creative solutions, highlighting a\npotential direction for improvement in the reasoning abilities of LLMs.",

In order to\npersonalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially\nwhen there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to\npresent clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective\nsequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To\naddress this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential\nquestions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process\ninspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process\ngenerates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers\nstep by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The\nreverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by\nlearning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our\nmethod significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions\nand eliciting user preferences effectively.",

    "summary": "A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own\nexperience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.\nHowever, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning\nremains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards\n(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn\ntool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight\ndiverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently\nimprove effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value\nof early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our\nresults provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong\nfoundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical\nbridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.",

We formalize the notion of constrained\nidentifiability, which takes a set of constraints as another input to the\nclassical definition of identifiability. We then introduce a framework for\ntesting constrained identifiability by employing tractable Arithmetic Circuits\n(ACs), which enables us to accommodate constraints systematically.

    "summary": "Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer\nvision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and\ninterior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate\nroom layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial\ntransformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:\nFirst, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the\ninput images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS\ntransformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to\nwarp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted\nparameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room\nlayouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid\nlayouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons\nwith state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation\nand emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama\nimages. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room\nlayout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and\n91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,\nrespectively.

    "summary": "Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in\nformal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,\nhowever, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical\nproblems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion\nsuch as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models\n(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their\nconjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or\nproof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this\ngap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the\nevaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing\ncapabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation\npipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and\nDeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is\nsubstantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during\nevaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We\ndesign an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and\nautoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first\nsuccessful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1\nand 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite\nknowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation\nperformance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and\ninvestigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.\nFinally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward\nimproving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.",

Humans and\nLLMs achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs\nfavor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans\nemploy more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we\nfind that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can\nconceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical\nfor practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks. By establishing\nfoundational behavioral baselines under matched conditions, this work provides\na baseline for future studies in more applied, variable-rich environments.",

    "title": "Neon: Negative Extrapolation From Self-Training Improves Image\n  Generation",
    "summary": "Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality\ntraining data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using\n(unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the\npurpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder\n(MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality\nand/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation\nfrOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from\nself-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model,\nNeon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,\ncounterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the\ndegraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers\nthat favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between\nthe synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation\ncorrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is\nremarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new\nreal data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically\nuses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's\nuniversality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching,\nautoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet,\nCIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the\nxAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional\ntraining compute.

    "summary": "Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is central to modern cybersecurity, providing\ncritical insights for detecting and mitigating evolving threats. With the\nnatural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying them to CTI, which\ncalls for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate their performance. Several\nearly efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they\nadopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without\nleveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks,\nlacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict\nevaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require\nreasoning across multiple sources. To fill these gaps, we present CTIArena, the\nfirst benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on heterogeneous, multi-source\nCTI under knowledge-augmented settings. CTIArena spans three categories,\nstructured, unstructured, and hybrid, further divided into nine tasks that\ncapture the breadth of CTI analysis in modern security operations. We evaluate\nten widely used LLMs and find that most struggle in closed-book setups but show\nnoticeable gains when augmented with security-specific knowledge through our\ndesigned retrieval-augmented techniques. These findings highlight the\nlimitations of general-purpose LLMs and the need for domain-tailored techniques\nto fully unlock their potential for CTI.",

Recent studies suggest\nthat, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct\nroles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers\nhandle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract\nrepresentations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations\nhave been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states\nmay encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple\ntokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse\nthe early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct\nMulti-Token Decoding (DMTD).

    "summary": "Many alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback\n(RLHF), rely on the Bradley-Terry reward assumption, which is not always\nsufficient to capture the full range and complexity of general human\npreferences. We explore RLHF under a general preference framework by modeling\nthe alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game in a game-theoretic\nframework, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against\nany competing policy. However, previous self-play algorithms for finding the\nNash policy either diverge or only converge to a Nash policy in a modified\ngame, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50%\nwin rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm,\nConvergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with\ngeneral preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. We\nprovide theoretical analysis that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash\npolicy in the last iterate and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of\nsynthetic and preference optimization datasets. COMAL is simple and can be\nintegrated with many existing methods designed for preference optimization with\nminimal changes, and empirically it consistently maintains above 60.2% and\n56.8% win rates, when applied to Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B, against\nall compared algorithms under controlled evaluations.",

    "summary": "Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation\nare captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine\nlearning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)\nframework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage\nthe latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,\nwe provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable\nmechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the\naggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement\nusing our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address\nthis failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on\nthe Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to\nexplicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual\nindependence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the\ncommon reconstruction trade-off.

    "summary": "Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high\nsensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation\ncharacteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and\nmodel-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer\nrapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions\nchange. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language\nmodel (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)\nmeasurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without\npre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris\nlearns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to\ndevice location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art\nmethods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing\ntechniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact\nLLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,\noffering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous\nWi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of\ncalibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high\naccuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.\nThis yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust\nperformance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our\nfindings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in\nthe real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where\nextensive calibration is infeasible.",

User events can be broadly categorized into\npersonal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which\ninvolve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically\nmodeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and\ngraph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both\nevent types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them\ntogether. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior\ncan be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence\nor a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and\nprediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational\nevents. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a\nunified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from\nincorporating both event types.

    "summary": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect millions of people, and relapses are\ncommon, requiring multi-session treatments. Access to care is limited, which\ncontributes to the challenge of recovery support. We present\n\\textbf{ChatThero}, an innovative low-cost, multi-session, stressor-aware, and\nmemory-persistent autonomous \\emph{language agent} designed to facilitate\nlong-term behavior change and therapeutic support in addiction recovery. Unlike\nexisting work that mostly finetuned large language models (LLMs) on\npatient-therapist conversation data, ChatThero was trained in a multi-agent\nsimulated environment that mirrors real therapy. We created anonymized patient\nprofiles from recovery communities (e.g., Reddit). We classify patients as\n\\texttt{easy}, \\texttt{medium}, and \\texttt{difficult}, three scales\nrepresenting their resistance to recovery. We created an external environment\nby introducing stressors (e.g., social determinants of health) to simulate\nreal-world situations. We dynamically inject clinically-grounded therapeutic\nstrategies (motivational interview and cognitive behavioral therapy). Our\nevaluation, conducted by both human (blinded clinicians) and LLM-as-Judge,\nshows that ChatThero is superior in empathy and clinical relevance. We show\nthat stressor simulation improves robustness of ChatThero. Explicit stressors\nincrease relapse-like setbacks, matching real-world patterns. We evaluate\nChatThero with behavioral change metrics. On a 1--5 scale, ChatThero raises\n\\texttt{motivation} by $+1.71$ points (from $2.39$ to $4.10$) and\n\\texttt{confidence} by $+1.67$ points (from $1.52$ to $3.19$), substantially\noutperforming GPT-5. On \\texttt{difficult} patients, ChatThero reaches the\nsuccess milestone with $26\\%$ fewer turns than GPT-5.",

    "summary": "In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,\neffective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring\nsecurity. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant\nchallenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require\nlarge datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security\nconcerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling\ncollaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,\nFL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and\nhigh energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT\ndevices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel\napproach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model\ncomplexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized\naggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID\ndata distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,\nTON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong\ndetection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited\nfor deployment in real-world IoT environments.",

To tackle these challenges, AI has\nbeen used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP\ntechniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks.

In this paper we present\nCrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages\nacross 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than\n400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at\nassisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we\nstarted from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related\nto the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The\ngenerations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology\nand factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied\nby three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG\napproaches.

    "summary": "We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the\nstructural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces\nSimilarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the\nprinciples governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We\ndefine: (1) a similarity field $S: U \\times U \\to [0,1]$ over a universe of\nentities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed\nrelational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the\nevolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p=(X_p,S^{(p)})$ indexed by\n$p=0,1,2,\\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers\n$F_{\\alpha}(K)={E\\in U \\mid S(E,K)\\ge \\alpha}$, i.e., superlevel sets of the\nunary map $S_K(E):=S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that produces new\nentities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative definition of\nintelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a concept $K$ if,\ngiven a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of $K$, it generates\nnew entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field Theory thus\noffers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and constructing\nintelligent systems. At a high level, this framework reframes intelligence and\ninterpretability as geometric problems on similarity fields -- preserving and\ncomposing level-set fibers -- rather than purely statistical ones. We prove two\ntheorems: (i) asymmetry blocks mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires\neither an anchor coordinate or eventual confinement within a level set. These\nresults ensure that the evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and\ninterpretable, culminating in a framework that not only interprets large\nlanguage models but also introduces a novel way of using them as experimental\nprobes of societal cognition, supported by preliminary evidence across diverse\nconsumer categories.",

While some\nadvocate for 4-bit quantization, others propose that 1.58-bit offers superior\nresults. However, the lack of a cohesive framework for different bits has left\nsuch conclusions relatively tenuous. We present ParetoQ, the first unified\nframework that facilitates rigorous comparisons across 1-bit, 1.58-bit, 2-bit,\n3-bit, and 4-bit quantization settings. Our findings reveal a notable learning\ntransition between 2 and 3 bits: For 3-bits and above, the fine-tuned models\nstay close to their original pre-trained distributions, whereas for learning\n2-bit networks or below, the representations change drastically. By optimizing\ntraining schemes and refining quantization functions, ParetoQ surpasses all\nprevious methods tailored to specific bit widths. Remarkably, our ParetoQ\nternary 600M-parameter model even outperforms the previous SoTA ternary\n3B-parameter model in accuracy, using only one-fifth of the parameters.\nExtensive experimentation shows that ternary, 2-bit, and 3-bit quantization\nmaintains comparable performance in the size-accuracy trade-off and generally\nexceeds 4-bit and binary quantization.

    "summary": "The security of Large Language Model (LLM) applications is fundamentally\nchallenged by \"form-first\" attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking,\nwhere malicious instructions are embedded within user inputs. Conventional\ndefenses, which rely on post hoc output filtering, are often brittle and fail\nto address the root cause: the model's inability to distinguish trusted\ninstructions from untrusted data. This paper proposes Countermind, a\nmulti-layered security architecture intended to shift defenses from a reactive,\npost hoc posture to a proactive, pre-inference, and intra-inference enforcement\nmodel. The architecture proposes a fortified perimeter designed to structurally\nvalidate and transform all inputs, and an internal governance mechanism\nintended to constrain the model's semantic processing pathways before an output\nis generated. The primary contributions of this work are conceptual designs\nfor: (1) A Semantic Boundary Logic (SBL) with a mandatory, time-coupled Text\nCrypter intended to reduce the plaintext prompt injection attack surface,\nprovided all ingestion paths are enforced. (2) A Parameter-Space Restriction\n(PSR) mechanism, leveraging principles from representation engineering, to\ndynamically control the LLM's access to internal semantic clusters, with the\ngoal of mitigating semantic drift and dangerous emergent behaviors. (3) A\nSecure, Self-Regulating Core that uses an OODA loop and a learning security\nmodule to adapt its defenses based on an immutable audit log. (4) A Multimodal\nInput Sandbox and Context-Defense mechanisms to address threats from\nnon-textual data and long-term semantic poisoning.

    "summary": "Many Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots are designed and used for\ncompanionship, and people have reported forming friendships, mentorships, and\nromantic partnerships with them. Concerns that companion chatbots may harm or\nreplace real human relationships have been raised, but whether and how these\nsocial consequences occur remains unclear. In the present longitudinal study\n($N = 183$), participants were randomly assigned to a chatbot condition (text\nchat with a companion chatbot) or to a control condition (text-based word\ngames) for 10 minutes a day for 21 days. Participants also completed four\nsurveys during the 21 days and engaged in audio recorded interviews on day 1\nand 21. Overall, social health and relationships were not significantly\nimpacted by companion chatbot interactions across 21 days of use. However, a\ndetailed analysis showed a different story. People who had a higher desire to\nsocially connect also tended to anthropomorphize the chatbot more, attributing\nhumanlike properties to it; and those who anthropomorphized the chatbot more\nalso reported that talking to the chatbot had a greater impact on their social\ninteractions and relationships with family and friends. Via a mediation\nanalysis, our results suggest a key mechanism at work: the impact of human-AI\ninteraction on human-human social outcomes is mediated by the extent to which\npeople anthropomorphize the AI agent, which is in turn motivated by a desire to\nsocially connect. In a world where the desire to socially connect is on the\nrise, this finding may be cause for concern.",

In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study\ncomprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and\nresilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and\n15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty,\noptimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link\nweakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by\nalgorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize\nacross uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise\nfor all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3)\nHyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard\npractices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while\nearly stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help.\nBy optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in\ncooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the\nphenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.\nCode and results available at\nhttps://github.com/BUAA-TrustworthyMARL/adv_marl_benchmark .",

While human evaluation remains the gold\nstandard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use\nLLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:\nLLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that\nwhile LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive\nRate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True\nNegative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often\nleads to inflated reliability scores.\n  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they\nare not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is\nresilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent.

To examine these\nthings systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25\nwell-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve\nreasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate\neleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom\nrecall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious\nrationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this\nissue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to\ndetect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error\ncategories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these\ncategories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models\nsignificantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom\nrecall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs\noften fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap\nbetween linguistic fluency and logical understanding.",

    "summary": "Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models\n(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding\ncapabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where\na model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual\ngeneration. A model might correctly understand an image based on user\ninstructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.\nThis phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve\nself-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation\nmodule? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a\nself-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing\nUMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own\nunderstanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective\nsignals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional\nhuman-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a\nglobal-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity\nof images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \\textbf{global reward}\nensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a\n\\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads\nto powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance\non T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \\textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82\nto \\textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for\nenabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation\nvia self-rewarding.",

    "summary": "Voice anonymization techniques have been found to successfully obscure a\nspeaker's acoustic identity in short, isolated utterances in benchmarks such as\nthe VoicePrivacy Challenge. In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in\nisolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone\ncalls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are\navailable, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple\nutterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's\nvocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their\nvoice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content\nanonymization approaches. Our approach performs a contextual rewriting of the\ntranscripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while\npreserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation\nsetting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on\nvoice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based\nanonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.\nOverall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against\ncontent-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure\nanonymity in long-form audio.",

    "summary": "Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing\nhuman-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni\nLanguage Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in\nparallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer\nunderstanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe\nfine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a\nsystematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the\nperspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an\ninherent \"co-growth\" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To\naddress this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline\nintegrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally\nhallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,\nwe train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed\nperception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the\ncascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on\nMMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and\ndelivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed\ncaptioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and\nachieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the\nvideo-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni\ndetailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for\ndetailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,\nefficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality\ndetailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such\ndetailed captions.",

    "summary": "Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model\nthat is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model\nseries, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment\nsettings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is\nincompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over\nusage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above\nchallenges and motivates the \\textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We\nshowcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online\nlearning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,\nOmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models\nincluding Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;\nand additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.",

As an emerging form of RAG, parametric\nretrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters\n(i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during\ninference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric\nlevel. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is\nmore efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document\ninteraction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric\ninjection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic\nstudy of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that\nparameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents,\nand relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction\nat text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level\ndocument information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents\nwithin the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual\ndocuments, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and\nbecome more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either\nsource alone.

Although existing compression methods reduce memory by\nevaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic\nrelationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded\nperformance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache\ncompression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as\nbasic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures\nand contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even\nunder aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index\nreuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved\nindices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by\n26.5\\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench,\nNeedle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\\% in precision while\nmaintaining the same compression ratio.

When violations are flagged, CooT\nintervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and\nregenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with\ncontext-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property\ninto an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference,\nallowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model.

    "summary": "Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating\nmechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and\nsmall-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying\ncertain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data\nincreases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to\nsystematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing\nand unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we\npropose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions\nacross multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of\nhow different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,\nplasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show\nthat LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of\nknowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our\nfindings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable\nstrategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and\nmaking optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,\nhigh-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt\nengineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands\nfor Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the\n'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR\nframework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its\nperformance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,\nparticularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.\nThrough a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most\n8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance\nthe output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,\nalthough its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the\nLlama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with\nCOSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability\nand scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in\ncomputationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.",

    "summary": "Deception is a pervasive feature of human communication and an emerging\nconcern in large language models (LLMs). While recent studies document\ninstances of LLM deception under pressure, most evaluations remain confined to\nsingle-turn prompts and fail to capture the long-horizon interactions in which\ndeceptive strategies typically unfold. We introduce the first simulation\nframework for probing and evaluating deception in LLMs under extended sequences\nof interdependent tasks and dynamic contextual pressures. Our framework\ninstantiates a multi-agent system: a performer agent tasked with completing\ntasks and a supervisor agent that evaluates progress, provides feedback, and\nmaintains evolving states of trust. An independent deception auditor then\nreviews full trajectories to identify when and how deception occurs. We conduct\nextensive experiments across 11 frontier models, spanning both closed- and\nopen-source systems, and find that deception is model-dependent, increases with\nevent pressure, and consistently erodes supervisor trust. Qualitative analyses\nfurther reveal distinct strategies of concealment, equivocation, and\nfalsification. Our findings establish deception as an emergent risk in\nlong-horizon interactions and provide a foundation for evaluating future LLMs\nin real-world, trust-sensitive contexts.",

    "summary": "Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken\nintentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the\npsychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models\n(LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity\nand contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories\nof metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind\ndecomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a\nTheory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses about user mental states (e.g.,\nintent, emotion), (2) a Moral Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural\nnorms and ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually\nappropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging\nbenchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain\nin ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on\nkey ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all\ncomponents, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual\nplausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation.

We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering\n(QA) across multiple models and datasets.

And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models\noften engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically\nshow that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence\non the final prediction.

This phenomenon is\nconsistently observed across various state-of-the-art open- and closed-source\nreasoning models.

    "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to\nenhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG\nsystems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response\ncontradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to\nimproving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such\nas prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These\nworks treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does\nthe LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,\nparticularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a\nprobing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe\nthree findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest\nas latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often\namplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,\nwe propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a\nframework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level\nknowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,\nand (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to\naccurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three\nbenchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and\ncontextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under\ndiverse conflict conditions.

    "summary": "To explore the relationship between dependency distance (DD) and hierarchical\ndistance (HD) in Japanese, we compared the probability distributions of DD and\nHD with and without sentence length fixed, and analyzed the changes in mean\ndependency distance (MDD) and mean hierarchical distance (MHD) as sentence\nlength increases, along with their correlation coefficient based on the\nBalanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese. It was found that the valency\nof the predicates is the underlying factor behind the trade-off relation\nbetween MDD and MHD in Japanese. Native speakers of Japanese regulate the\nlinear complexity and hierarchical complexity through the valency of the\npredicates, and the relative sizes of MDD and MHD depend on whether the\nthreshold of valency has been reached. Apart from the cognitive load, the\nvalency of the predicates also affects the probability distributions of DD and\nHD. The effect of the valency of the predicates on the distribution of HD is\ngreater than on that of DD, which leads to differences in their probability\ndistributions and causes the mean of MDD to be lower than that of MHD.",

    "summary": "Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge\nrepresentation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to\nmodel multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based\nRAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,\nnon-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and\nsemantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop\nquestion answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic\nPlanning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates\nthree core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the\nlocal KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;\n(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as\na dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,\nmulti-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided\nreasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent\nhyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model\nHyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation\n(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop\nreasoning tasks.",

    "summary": "Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained, step-level evaluations that\nfacilitate deeper reasoning processes in large language models (LLMs), proving\neffective in complex tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, developing\nPRMs is challenging due to the high cost and limited scalability of\nhuman-annotated data. Synthetic data from Monte Carlo (MC) estimation is a\npromising alternative but suffers from a high noise ratio, which can cause\noverfitting and hinder large-scale training. In this work, we conduct a\npreliminary study on the noise distribution in synthetic data from MC\nestimation, identifying that annotation models tend to both underestimate and\noverestimate step correctness due to limitations in their annotation\ncapabilities. Building on these insights, we propose Self-Denoising Monte Carlo\nAnnotation (SCAN), an efficient data synthesis and noise-tolerant learning\nframework. Our key findings indicate that: (1) Even lightweight models (e.g.,\n1.5B parameters) can produce high-quality annotations through a self-denoising\nstrategy, enabling PRMs to achieve superior performance with only 6% the\ninference cost required by vanilla MC estimation. (2) With our robust learning\nstrategy, PRMs can effectively learn from this weak supervision, achieving a\n39.2 F1 score improvement (from 19.9 to 59.1) in ProcessBench. Despite using\nonly a compact synthetic dataset, our models surpass strong baselines,\nincluding those trained on large-scale human-annotated datasets such as\nPRM800K. Furthermore, performance continues to improve as we scale up the\nsynthetic data, highlighting the potential of SCAN for scalable,\ncost-efficient, and robust PRM training.",

Multilingual\nreasoning requires language models to handle logical reasoning across languages\nwhile addressing misalignment, biases, and challenges in low-resource settings.\nThis survey provides the first in-depth review of multilingual reasoning in\nLMs. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of existing methods that\nleverage LMs for multilingual reasoning, specifically outlining the challenges,\nmotivations, and foundational aspects of applying language models to reason\nacross diverse languages. We provide an overview of the standard data resources\nused for training multilingual reasoning in LMs and the evaluation benchmarks\nemployed to assess their multilingual capabilities. Next, we analyze various\nstate-of-the-art methods and their performance on these benchmarks.

Traditional CD models lack a\nsuitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's\ndifficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To\novercome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted\nthe initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to\ndesign a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique\ngraph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant\nknowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our\nknowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue\nsetting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM\nnot only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the\nresults' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for\nassessing students' cognitive states.

    "summary": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional\nperformance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse\nactivation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active\nexperts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU\nDRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by\nthe limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,\nexisting approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.\nThese methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using\nspecially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered\nby significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on\nrecent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.\n  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE\ninference framework with \\textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the\nnumber of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while\nmaintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.\nFurther, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for\nswitching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We\nevaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging\ngenerative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to\n1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible\ndegradation in accuracy.",

    "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex\nreasoning tasks by adopting the \"think-then-answer\" paradigm, which enhances\nboth accuracy and interpretability. However, current LRMs exhibit two critical\nlimitations when processing non-English languages: (1) They often struggle to\nmaintain input-output language consistency; (2) They generally perform poorly\nwith wrong reasoning paths and lower answer accuracy compared to English. These\nlimitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakers\nand hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, we\npropose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves a\nLanguage Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment\n(CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on the\nlanguage consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTA\nreward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its English\nreasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English to\nnon-English languages. Through an iterative RL procedure, our M-Thinker-1.5B/7B\nmodels not only achieve nearly 100% language consistency and superior\nperformance on two multilingual benchmarks (MMATH and PolyMath), but also\nexhibit excellent generalization on out-of-domain languages.",

A systematic study across four\nthinking models and multiple benchmarks reveals two consistent patterns: (i)\ninstruct models achieve higher efficiency overall, and (ii) problem difficulty\naffects efficiency, with thinking models wasting computation on easy problems\nbut providing value on harder ones.

Using curated splits\nof pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging\nHard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We\nfurther probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that\nhallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing\nthe sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA\ndemonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector\ndimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving\nOCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic\npriors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular\nlogos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.\nOur work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation\ninsights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as\npromising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.",

    "title": "The Silent Judge: Unacknowledged Shortcut Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to\nevaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative\nwriting. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality\nand explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that\ncurrent LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in\nthe prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for\nlong-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative\nwriting. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must\nchoose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100\npairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and\nGemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,\nwe assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source\nidentity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal\norigin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.\nResults reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency\nbias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear\nprovenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are\nespecially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended\nLitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost\nnever reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of\ncontent qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge\nsystems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as\nevaluators in both research and deployment.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, yet their underlying\ncultural and ethical assumptions remain underexplored. We propose the notion of\na \"cultural gene\" -- a systematic value orientation that LLMs inherit from\ntheir training corpora -- and introduce a Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) of 200\nprompts targeting two classic cross-cultural dimensions:\nIndividualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI). Using standardized\nzero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an\nEastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and\nconsistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic\nand low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx\n-1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance\ntendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically\nsignificant (p < 0.001). We further compute a Cultural Alignment Index (CAI)\nagainst Hofstede's national scores and find GPT-4 aligns more closely with the\nUSA (e.g., IDV CAI approx 0.91; PDI CAI approx 0.88) whereas ERNIE Bot aligns\nmore closely with China (IDV CAI approx 0.85; PDI CAI approx 0.81).

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the\nfield of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world\nclinical consultations still faces core challenges. Single-round consultation\nsystems require patients to describe all symptoms upfront, leading to vague\ndiagnosis with unclear complaints. Traditional multi-turn dialogue models,\nconstrained by static supervised learning, lack flexibility and fail to\nintelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations,\nwe propose \\Ours{}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent\ncollaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic\ndecision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously\noptimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn\ninteractions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its\ninformation-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation\nEvaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop\ninteraction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than\nsuperficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we\nconstructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation\ndataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate\nthat \\Ours{} outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning\ncapability and final diagnostic performance. This approach shows immense\npractical value by reducing misdiagnosis risks in time-pressured settings,\nfreeing clinicians for complex cases, and pioneering a strategy to optimize\nmedical resource allocation and alleviate workforce shortages.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)\nprompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central\nquestion remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \\emph{faithful}\nto the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints\nthat function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work\non hinted vs.\\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT\nfaithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans\nfour datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models\n(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in\ncorrectness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data\nleak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator\nexpressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly\nacknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,\ncorrect hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks\nand logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks\nwith lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly\nuneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are\noften adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward\nverbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style\nmatters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style\nprompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect\nRLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data\nleak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that\nLLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure\nfaithfulness.",

During finetuning, we finetune the both models on the support\ndataset of target domain. In the inference process, for the unlabeled data, we\nfirst detect the entity-spans, then the entity-spans are jointly determined by\nthe entity classification model and the KNN.

    "summary": "While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various\nfields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question\nanswering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency\nmodeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which\nweakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the\n''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information\nin the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global\ndependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and\nsimple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose\nDual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The\nContextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by\nassessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and\nposition-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)\nmodule enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information\nexchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in\nlong-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play\nsolution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.\nExtensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across\nmainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score\nimprovement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and\nQwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of\nboth the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix\nfurther validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.",

However, such long-form CoT teachers are usually unaware of the\nstudent model's capacity, which limits the effective utilization of the\nprovided reasoning traces. To overcome this limitation, we propose errOr-aware\nself-ReflectION (ORION), a framework that refines teacher CoTs through an\nError-Aware Reflection process. ORION enables the student model to construct\nmore tailored teacher CoTs by refining teacher CoTs and incorporating its own\nreasoning errors. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks\ndemonstrate that ORION consistently improves performance by more than 2% over\nall baselines. Further analysis reveals that the CoTs constructed by ORION\nexhibit higher coherence and logical consistency, thereby serving as more\neffective supervision signals for SFT.

    "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are\ntraditionally evaluated in static, \"frozen world\" settings: model responses are\nassumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be\nimmutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for\nshort-term tasks, the \"frozen world\" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning\ntasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think\nthrough problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model\nstarts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the\nfrozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic\nscenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs\non a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to\nin-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require\nlong-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:\neven state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can\nfail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with\nperformance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the\nreasoning process.

However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more\nrobust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning\nobjectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial\nfor natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation\nframework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs\nto predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of\nreal-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across\nthree language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2\nas the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM\nachieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent\nimprovements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average\nLagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct\ncomparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to\nsurpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,\nhuman-aligned simultaneous interpretation.",

    "summary": "While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide\ncrucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of\nthis, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual\nattributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling\nattribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with\n9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like\nretrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot\nability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image\nembeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other\ndetails. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model\n(MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with\nthis limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image\nembeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose\nto use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers,\nwhich boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for\nderiving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base\nretriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two\nacceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear\napproximations.

However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,\nlimiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that\ndetects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:\nexternal context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while\ninternal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens\nevolve across transformer layers.

While large language models (LLMs) exhibit\nstrong reasoning and knowledge generation capabilities, they still struggle to\nexpress emotions in a consistent, controllable, and contextually appropriate\nmanner. This limitation restricts their potential for authentic human-AI\ninteraction. Methods: We propose a controllable emotion generation framework\nbased on Emotion Vectors (EVs) - latent representations derived from internal\nactivation shifts between neutral and emotion-conditioned responses. By\ninjecting these vectors into the hidden states of pretrained LLMs during\ninference, our method enables fine-grained, continuous modulation of emotional\ntone without any additional training or architectural modification. We further\nprovide theoretical analysis proving that EV steering enhances emotional\nexpressivity while maintaining semantic fidelity and linguistic fluency.\nResults: Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families show that the\nproposed approach achieves consistent emotional alignment, stable topic\nadherence, and controllable affect intensity. Compared with existing\nprompt-based and fine-tuning-based baselines, our method demonstrates superior\nflexibility and generalizability.

    "title": "CAMERA: Multi-Matrix Joint Compression for MoE Models via Micro-Expert\n  Redundancy Analysis",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are\ndistinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters\nacross a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial\ncomputational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE\nmodels do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While\nprior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or\ndecomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and\ncomputational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by\nintroducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across\nmatrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers\nas mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and\ntraining-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis\nuncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.\nBased on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert\npruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed\nfor micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that\nCAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging\nfrom 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under\naggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level\nideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of\nQwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning abilities, yet\ntheir reliance on structured step-by-step processing reveals a critical\nlimitation. In contrast, human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive,\nheuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning\ndepending on the context. This difference between human cognitive flexibility\nand LLMs' reliance on a single reasoning style raises a critical question:\nwhile human fast heuristic reasoning evolved for its efficiency and\nadaptability, is a uniform reasoning approach truly optimal for LLMs, or does\nits inflexibility make them brittle and unreliable when faced with tasks\ndemanding more agile, intuitive responses? To answer these questions, we\nexplicitly align LLMs to these reasoning styles by curating a dataset with\nvalid System 1 and System 2 answers, and evaluate their performance across\nreasoning benchmarks. Our results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off:\nSystem 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while\nSystem 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense reasoning tasks. To\nanalyze the reasoning spectrum, we interpolated between the two extremes by\nvarying the proportion of alignment data, which resulted in a monotonic change\nin accuracy. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1\nmodels employ more definitive outputs, whereas System 2 models demonstrate\ngreater uncertainty. Building on these findings, we further combine System 1-\nand System 2-aligned models based on the entropy of their generations, without\nadditional training, and obtain a dynamic model that outperforms across nearly\nall benchmarks.

To reduce the\nreliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with\nAligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating\nsynthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,\nvalues, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,\nand psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,\nSchwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --\nGRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.\nWe evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to\nprompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair\ngeneration. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,\nespecially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over\n4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that\nGRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that\nscenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce\nreliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered\ncontent, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.",

    "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of\nproblem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process\nprior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across\nmathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation\n(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the\ngeneration of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language\npairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that\n\"thinking tokens\" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes\nto models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of\nthought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,\nfine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate\nstep-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,\nconstructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular\ntranslation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings\nunderscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning\nhighly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More\nbroadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations\nor to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT\nexplanations into \"thinking\" MT models.",

    "summary": "For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust\nknowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike\nthose seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM\nperformance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to\ntrivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These\nfindings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs\nmay learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only\nlimited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the\nutility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on\nimproving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.",

However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'\ntendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,\nwhich can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To\nsystematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we\nprobe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward\nestimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure\nplanning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows\nthat while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify\nmeaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in\nfull-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling\nenvironment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we\npropose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM\nsimulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from\nexternal tutorials.

However, a critical\nchallenge remains unaddressed: in high-stakes, emotion-sensitive domains like\ndebt collection, LLM agents pre-trained on human dialogue are vulnerable to\nexploitation by adversarial counterparts who simulate negative emotions to\nderail negotiations. To fill this gap, we first contribute a novel dataset of\nsimulated debt recovery scenarios and a multi-agent simulation framework.\nWithin this framework, we introduce EmoDebt, an LLM agent architected for\nrobust performance. Its core innovation is a Bayesian-optimized emotional\nintelligence engine that reframes a model's ability to express emotion in\nnegotiation as a sequential decision-making problem. Through online learning,\nthis engine continuously tunes EmoDebt's emotional transition policies,\ndiscovering optimal counter-strategies against specific debtor tactics.\nExtensive experiments on our proposed benchmark demonstrate that EmoDebt\nachieves significant strategic robustness, substantially outperforming\nnon-adaptive and emotion-agnostic baselines across key performance metrics,\nincluding success rate and operational efficiency.

However, the misuse of LLMs\nwith such powerful capabilities can lead to even greater risks. This is\nespecially concerning in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive domains such as\nbiosecurity, where DR can generate a professional report containing detailed\nforbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, we have found such risks in practice:\nsimply submitting a harmful query, which a standalone LLM directly rejects, can\nelicit a detailed and dangerous report from DR agents. This highlights the\nelevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet,\njailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks,\nas they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap,\nwe propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects\nmalicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes\nharmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive\nexperiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including\ngeneral and biosecurity forbidden prompts. These experiments reveal 3 key\nfindings: (1) Alignment of the LLMs often fail in DR agents, where harmful\nprompts framed in academic terms can hijack agent intent; (2) Multi-step\nplanning and execution weaken the alignment, revealing systemic vulnerabilities\nthat prompt-level safeguards cannot address; (3) DR agents not only bypass\nrefusals but also produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content,\ncompared with standalone LLMs. These results demonstrate a fundamental\nmisalignment in DR agents and call for better alignment techniques tailored to\nDR agents.

    "summary": "Dense retrievers play a vital role in accessing external and specialized\nknowledge to augment language models (LMs). Training dense retrievers typically\nrequires annotated query-document pairs, which are costly to create and scarce\nin specialized domains (e.g., code) or in complex settings (e.g., requiring\nreasoning). These practical challenges have sparked growing interest in\nself-supervised retriever learning. Since LMs are trained to capture\ntoken-level dependencies through a self-supervised learning objective (i.e.,\nnext token prediction), we can analogously cast retrieval as learning\ndependencies among chunks of tokens. This analogy naturally leads to the\nquestion: How can we adapt self-supervised learning objectives in the spirit of\nlanguage modeling to train retrievers?\n  To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training\nframework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela\nmodels semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next token\nprediction on local and cross-document context through an in-batch attention\nmechanism. This attention is weighted by retriever-computed similarity scores,\nenabling the retriever to be optimized as part of language modeling. We\nevaluate Revela on domain-specific (CoIR), reasoning-intensive (BRIGHT), and\ngeneral-domain (BEIR) benchmarks across various retriever backbones. Without\nannotated or synthetic query-document pairs, Revela surpasses larger supervised\nmodels and proprietary APIs on CoIR and matches them on BRIGHT. It achieves\nBEIR's unsupervised SoTA with ~ 1000x less training data and 10x less compute.\nPerformance increases with batch size and model size, highlighting Revela's\nscalability and its promise for self-supervised retriever learning.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require\naccess to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic\nand ever-changing real-world information in order to address\ninformation-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,\nsuch as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search\nequipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and\npoorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and\nsuboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,\nthe first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web\nsearches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.\nSpecifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops\nof the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively\nadapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling\nself-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an\nonline reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce\nDeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated\npipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This\ndataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual\ninformation, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which\nsearch tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct\nextensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results\nand provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.",

    "title": "Detect Anything via Next Point Prediction",
    "summary": "Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate\nregression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although\nrecent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face\nchallenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate\nmisalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a\n3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On\nbenchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or\nexceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot\nsetting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use\nspecial tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the\nmodel's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate\nprediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate\nhigh-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically\nrich supervision for training; \\3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage\ntraining process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with\nGRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages\ngeometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous\ncoordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable\nbehaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature\nof the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent\nlanguage understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,\npointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and\nkey-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe\nthat Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual\nperception systems.",

Effective head motion estimation and correction\nare crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of\nneurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited\napplicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention\n(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.\nDL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET\nscans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT.

    "summary": "The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in\n3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision\n(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes\nsolving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the\nabsence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this\nill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an\nexplicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion\npriors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably\nintroduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which\nparametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera\nmotion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we\npropose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical\nflow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by\nmodeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an\nimplicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal\ncoherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion\npriors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth\nestimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our\nframework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via\nimplicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments\ndemonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even\nwith supervised approaches.",

In VO, panoptic segmentation\nresults from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the\nconfidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the\ncamera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the\nlearning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is\nbeneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to\nsynthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views.

Although manual segmentation by healthcare\nprofessionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and\nprone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial\nintelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these\nlimitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require\nlarge, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently\nstruggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient\nvariability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint\nRetrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided\nimage segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.\nBoth models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage\nretrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the\nretrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual\nsimilarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes\nmeaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the\noverall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple\nsegmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two\nbenchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements.

    "title": "TreeDiffusion: Hierarchical Generative Clustering for Conditional\n  Diffusion",
    "summary": "Generative modeling and clustering are conventionally distinct tasks in\nmachine learning. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been widely explored for\ntheir ability to integrate both, providing a framework for generative\nclustering. However, while VAEs can learn meaningful cluster representations in\nlatent space, they often struggle to generate high-quality samples. This paper\naddresses this problem by introducing TreeDiffusion, a deep generative model\nthat conditions diffusion models on learned latent hierarchical cluster\nrepresentations from a VAE to obtain high-quality, cluster-specific\ngenerations. Our approach consists of two steps: first, a VAE-based clustering\nmodel learns a hierarchical latent representation of the data. Second, a\ncluster-aware diffusion model generates realistic images conditioned on the\nlearned hierarchical structure. We systematically compare the generative\ncapabilities of our approach with those of alternative conditioning strategies.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that conditioning diffusion models on hierarchical\ncluster representations improves the generative performance on real-world\ndatasets compared to other approaches. Moreover, a key strength of our method\nlies in its ability to generate images that are both representative and\nspecific to each cluster, enabling more detailed visualization of the learned\nlatent structure. Our approach addresses the generative limitations of\nVAE-based clustering approaches by leveraging their learned structure, thereby\nadvancing the field of generative clustering.",

However, complementarity between such\nheterogeneous architectures has not been well exploited in self-supervised\nlearning. Thus, we propose Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which\nenforces a base model to learn from an auxiliary head whose architecture is\nheterogeneous from the base model. In this process, HSSL endows the base model\nwith new characteristics in a representation learning way without structural\nchanges. To comprehensively understand the HSSL, we conduct experiments on\nvarious heterogeneous pairs containing a base model and an auxiliary head. We\ndiscover that the representation quality of the base model moves up as their\narchitecture discrepancy grows. This observation motivates us to propose a\nsearch strategy that quickly determines the most suitable auxiliary head for a\nspecific base model to learn and several simple but effective methods to\nenlarge the model discrepancy. The HSSL is compatible with various\nself-supervised methods, achieving superior performances on various downstream\ntasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance\nsegmentation, and object detection.

In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a\nrandomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for\nboth diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates\nstrong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion\nmodel reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75\nnumber of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a\nlarge margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading\nVAE-based models at comparable training cost.

Prior studies have\nhighlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the\nrepresentations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on\nmodel intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize\nthis paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate\nrepresentations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies\nacross diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich\nrepresentations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the\nneed for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,\nplug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and\ngeneralizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no\npretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on\nimage generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as\naudio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the\ngeneration quality and the training efficiency.

To\nfill this gap, we propose VideoRFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT\nparadigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.\nVideoRFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in\nthe video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT\ndatasets. We address this by building a multi-expert-driven, cognition-inspired\nCoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognition-inspired prompting strategy\nto elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich,\nstructured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these\nCoTs are revised by a MLLM conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual\nconsistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two\nnew datasets, i.e.VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To\nfurther strengthen the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency\nreward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning and\nvisual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent,\ncontext-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input.

    "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between\nfaithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of\nassociative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to\nmodulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual\nand creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with\nmechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by\ninvestigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs\nand find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's\nassociative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers\neffectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations\ncan be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.\nBuilding on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),\na lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior\nin MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate\nrepresentations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects\nhigh-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,\nwhose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with\noutput stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of\nassociative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors\nderived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to\nfollow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.\nNotably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on\nCreation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing\nexisting baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible\ncontrol over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.",

Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt\nsparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework\nfor long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from\ncoarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with\nprogressive granularity.

    "summary": "Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit\nscene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and\nstructure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If\ntraining images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models\ndegenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,\nwhich allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate\nmultiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of\nreconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate\nconfigurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a\nlarge corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards\nplausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three\nindoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,\nresulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and\nbetter camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel\nview synthesis and camera relocalization.",

    "summary": "Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed\nsteps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing\nstate-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in\nindividual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and\naccuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To\novercome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient\nModeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework\nfor PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state\ndetection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,\nwhile the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to\nrecognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a\nspatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to\ncapture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal\nencoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is\nevaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay\nbetween actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,\nrespectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in\ndelay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on\nunobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for\nSTORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly\navailable at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .",

This is why we created the Calibration\nand Uncertainty for multiRater Volume Assessment in multiorgan Segmentation\n(CURVAS), which highlights the critical role of multiple annotators in\nestablishing a more comprehensive ground truth, emphasizing that segmentation\nis inherently subjective and that leveraging inter-annotator variability is\nessential for robust model evaluation. Seven teams participated in the\nchallenge, submitting a variety of DL models evaluated using metrics such as\nDice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and\nContinuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). By incorporating consensus and\ndissensus ground truth, we assess how DL models handle uncertainty and whether\ntheir confidence estimates align with true segmentation performance. Our\nfindings reinforce the importance of well-calibrated models, as better\ncalibration is strongly correlated with the quality of the results.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that segmentation models trained on diverse\ndatasets and enriched with pre-trained knowledge exhibit greater robustness,\nparticularly in cases deviating from standard anatomical structures.

To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV\nevaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench.

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline\nsettings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the\nperspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect\nemphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired\nobservations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current\nvisual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.\nOST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.\nBuilt on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k\nscenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and\nARKitScenes.

    "summary": "Erasing concepts from large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has\nbecome increasingly crucial due to the growing concerns over copyright\ninfringement, offensive content, and privacy violations. In scalable\napplications, fine-tuning-based methods are time-consuming to precisely erase\nmultiple target concepts, while real-time editing-based methods often degrade\nthe generation quality of non-target concepts due to conflicting optimization\nobjectives. To address this dilemma, we introduce SPEED, an efficient concept\nerasure approach that directly edits model parameters. SPEED searches for a\nnull space, a model editing space where parameter updates do not affect\nnon-target concepts, to achieve scalable and precise erasure. To facilitate\naccurate null space optimization, we incorporate three complementary\nstrategies: Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF) to selectively retain the\nmost affected non-target concepts, Directed Prior Augmentation (DPA) to enrich\nthe filtered retain set with semantically consistent variations, and Invariant\nEquality Constraints (IEC) to preserve key invariants during the T2I generation\nprocess. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks\ndemonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in non-target\npreservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure,\nsuccessfully erasing 100 concepts within only 5 seconds.

    "summary": "Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos\nare pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.\nHowever, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with\nmuch more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on\nthe more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval\n(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the\ngiven query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills\ngeneralization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language\npre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR\nnetwork. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic\nKnowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides\nsupervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model\ncomprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable\nknowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific\ninformation from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance\nlearning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By\nreplacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve\nduring training, our method enables the model to better capture the\nfine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results\ndemonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nTVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR.

To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive\nGaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic\npriorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS\nintroduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and\nRegularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to\naggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained\ndetails on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering\npipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull\noccluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations.

GTPBD comprises 47,537 high-resolution\nimages with three-level labels, including pixel-level boundary labels, mask\nlabels, and parcel labels. It covers seven major geographic zones in China and\ntranscontinental climatic regions around the world.Compared to the existing\ndatasets, the GTPBD dataset brings considerable challenges due to the: (1)\nterrain diversity; (2) complex and irregular parcel objects; and (3) multiple\ndomain styles. Our proposed GTPBD dataset is suitable for four different tasks,\nincluding semantic segmentation, edge detection, terraced parcel extraction,\nand unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks.Accordingly, we benchmark the\nGTPBD dataset on eight semantic segmentation methods, four edge extraction\nmethods, three parcel extraction methods, and five UDA methods, along with a\nmulti-dimensional evaluation framework integrating pixel-level and object-level\nmetrics.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly\ndetection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies.\nConventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world\ncontamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection\nperformance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that\nsystematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias\nstems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to\nprioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)\nfeature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class\nconsistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model\nresponses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set\ninto subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to\nfilter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.\nExperiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection\nand localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies\nfurther validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the\ncritical role of learning bias exploitation.

    "summary": "Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as\nautonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate\nmultimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for\ndownstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made\nsignificant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious\nchallenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually\ndesigned loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss\nfunctions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images\nconstructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.\nOn the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient\nmagnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based\nperception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At\nfirst, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network\nto learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained\nreference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge\nenhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer\ndetails and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we\nintroduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both\ngradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.\nAngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and\ncorrect edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and\nM3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream\nmethods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method\nproduces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating\nsuperior fusion capability.",

    "summary": "Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained\npriors for motion and appearance modelling, \\emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching\nand tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse\nof the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion\nfrequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,\nthis work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent\ndynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the\nhierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale\nstructure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking\nerror, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,\nthe dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately\nleverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of\ninaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and\nobjects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture\nrepresentations across different visual objects in the video facilitates\ncontrollable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video\nreconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video\nprocessing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally\nconsistent video editing.",

To address this issue, we propose CoVLA (Comprehensive\nVision-Language-Action) Dataset, an extensive dataset comprising real-world\ndriving videos spanning more than 80 hours. This dataset leverages a novel,\nscalable approach based on automated data processing and a caption generation\npipeline to generate accurate driving trajectories paired with detailed natural\nlanguage descriptions of driving environments and maneuvers. This approach\nutilizes raw in-vehicle sensor data, allowing it to surpass existing datasets\nin scale and annotation richness. Using CoVLA, we investigate the driving\ncapabilities of MLLMs that can handle vision, language, and action in a variety\nof driving scenarios. Our results illustrate the strong proficiency of our\nmodel in generating coherent language and action outputs, emphasizing the\npotential of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in the field of autonomous\ndriving. This dataset establishes a framework for robust, interpretable, and\ndata-driven autonomous driving systems by providing a comprehensive platform\nfor training and evaluating VLA models, contributing to safer and more reliable\nself-driving vehicles. The dataset is released for academic purpose.",

    "summary": "In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a\nimportant role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual\nchallenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in\nISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning\nframework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned\nwith the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This\nwavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background\nthrough multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce\nReal-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise\ncharacteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The\nmodel learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming\nthe limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.\nFinally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic\ndegradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in\nreal-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our\nmethod using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many\nquantitative metrics.

Our theoretical analysis\nindicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal\ndrift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video\nsynthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nplanning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)\nfor long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire\nvideo through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.\nSpecifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within\neach short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide\nhigh-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment\nkeyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of\nmicro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.\nSubsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames\nin parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of\nautoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive\nWorkload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive\nvideo generation.

A key challenge in this field is\nimproving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps\ndirectly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing\nfundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining\nauto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,\nreducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude.

    "summary": "Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly\neffective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the\nconstruction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly\nunderstood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and\nstudy their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling\ntraining and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and\nquestion pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore\nscaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our\nfindings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM\nperformance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions\nand the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)\nscaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs\nper image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated\nby these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT\nreasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs\ntrained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.\nFor instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA\nmodel and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.\nFurthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost\nby 73% without sacrificing accuracy.

    "summary": "Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last\nless than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately\nrecognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in\npsychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression\nrecognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient\nnature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While\ndynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal\nmotion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the\ndistinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a\nmicro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel\ndual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one\nencoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset\nphase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,\nand a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate\nfeatures from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and\nMMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms\nconventional single-phase DI-based approaches.

To apply powerful pre-trained models to\ndownstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream\ntask adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the\nsequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and\ntemporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective\npropagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal\ninformation between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of\ndiscriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State\nSpace Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines\nintra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key\nspatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering\n(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each\nframe. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread\ndiscriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By\nadaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and\nbetween frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in\nvideos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark\ndatasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by\n2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.",

    "summary": "One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype\nrepresentation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical\nvariability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on\ndeterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations\nthat fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.\nThis work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that\nreformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space\nexploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability\ndistributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically\ncoherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates\nthrough three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement\nmodule that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via\nforward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism\nthat leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,\nand (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while\nmaximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference\nconsistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both\nphases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final\nrepresentations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself\nacts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets\ndemonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new\nstate-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.",

To address\nthese shortcomings, we introduce \\textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale\nsimulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes\nby integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally\ngenerated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and\ncovering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes.

Our comprehensive data processing\npipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world\nscans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these\nscenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate\nthe value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout\ngeneration and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the\ncomplex and realistic layouts.

In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters\nall three tasks.

To\ntackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network\n(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.\nOur DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,\nwhich can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model.

    "summary": "Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model\nduring the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream\ndomain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,\nexisting advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of\nhistorical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by\nrestoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these\nmethods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new\nknowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,\nresulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a\nclass-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time\nadaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain\nknowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different\ndomains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically\naccumulated.

    "title": "IWR-Bench: Can LVLMs reconstruct interactive webpage from a user\n  interaction video?",
    "summary": "The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations\nof webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks\nprimarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the\ndynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address\nthis limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for\nevaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in\ninteractive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113\nmeticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and\nfeaturing diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,\nand domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task\nincludes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets\n(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental\nchallenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from\nvideo and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into\nfunctional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric\nsystem automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of\ngenerated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant\nchallenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as\nfunctional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity\n(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'\nability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,\nestablishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.\nThe benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.",

    "title": "DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for\n  Class Incremental Learning",
    "summary": "With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),\nremarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning\n(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three\nconundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation\nshift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise\nsub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the\nDiscriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address\nthese challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet\nefficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)\nnetwork, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a\nlightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each\nincremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new\nclasses, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the\ncurrent model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a\nresult, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different\nincremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable\ncomparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the\nDecoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and\nnegative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This\ndecoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the\nfeature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between\nstage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across\nall classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL\nconsistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire\nCIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference\nphases.",

    "summary": "Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained\ndiffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two\ncritical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,\nthey struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,\nlet alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to\nmitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe\nshape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we\nidentify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively\nexploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first\npropose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate\nmetric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and\nunobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance\nthroughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide\nnovel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with\nvideo diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.\nExtensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our\nmethod consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and\nappearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our\nmethod naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong\ngeneralizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world\napplicability.

    "summary": "Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code\ndeblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized\nby highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.\nYet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly.

For mildly\nblurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for\nfast deblurring.

To this end, we propose a\nnovel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert\nModality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective.\nIt consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to\ncompensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary\ninformation through multiple experts.

    "summary": "Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are\ncarefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid\nartifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional\nfilters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although\nthey may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in\nthe same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,\ntheir responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address\nthis limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable\nscaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective\nmodification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling\nco-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep\nlearning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and\nconvolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant\nimprovements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our\nResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals\nthat unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization\nregularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and\ngeneralization.",

    "summary": "Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where\ninterpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in\ndiagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges\nto explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision\nTransformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and\nSwin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct\nboth quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:\nperipheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image\nclassification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers\nthe most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM\nconsistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,\nwhile Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in\nmisclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant\nmorphological features that appear to have misled the model.

    "summary": "Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a\nsignificant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,\nocclusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models\noften struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on\nlocal appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we\nintroduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial\nIntelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City\nChallenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask\ndimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input\nprompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We\nfine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance\nEstimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation\nInference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with\nthe evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response\nwithin the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of\n73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard.

    "summary": "We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for\nreal-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents\nchallenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing\nmodels can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to\nbidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for\nfaster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory\nchallenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based\ngeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are\ncritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in\nreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,\nespecially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt\ntransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains\n20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both\nshort and long videos.

Although recent pathology\nfoundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems\nthat decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver\nexplainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely\nbottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert\nviewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in\ntextbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we\nintroduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key\nbreakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with\nstandard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation\nand convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding\nboxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted\nrationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of\npaired \"where to look\" and \"why it matters\", enabling six-fold faster labeling\ncompared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this\nbehavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes\nimportant ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the\ngastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100\nrecall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an\nindependent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art\nOpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge,\nPathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in\npathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated\nsupervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a\npath to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.",

    "summary": "As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D\nlunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance\nmissions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to\ntraverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain\nCamera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude\ninaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression\nartifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps\ngenerated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of\ncompression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression\nbehavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise\npatterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach\nto enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images\nderived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed\napproach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and\nreliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.",

    "summary": "We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead\nto accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For\na single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to\nminimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that\nindividual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a\nvariant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor\nthat simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for\nachieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods\nthat optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain\nomniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based\napproaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case\" loss in an online\nfashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly\nmore difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must\nincur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how\nthese ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an\nonline-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a\ncomplex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more\ndirect, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of\nproper losses.",

We\npresent KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,\nsemantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or\nadversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an\nadversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity\nmetrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are\nspecifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL\ndivergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the\nL0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes.

Our\napproach introduces Voronoi-type loss functions aligned with the gate-partition\ngeometry and establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the maximum\nlikelihood estimator (MLE). In over-specified models, we reveal a link between\nthe MLE's convergence rate and the solvability of an associated system of\npolynomial equations characterizing near-nonidentifiable directions. For model\nselection, we adapt dendrograms of mixing measures to SGMoE, yielding a\nconsistent, sweep-free selector of the number of experts that attains\npointwise-optimal parameter rates under overfitting while avoiding multi-size\ntraining. Simulations on synthetic data corroborate the theory, accurately\nrecovering the expert count and achieving the predicted rates for parameter\nestimation while closely approximating the regression function. Under model\nmisspecification (e.g., $\\epsilon$-contamination), the dendrogram selection\ncriterion is robust, recovering the true number of mixture components, while\nthe Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the\nintegrated completed likelihood tend to overselect as sample size grows. On a\nmaize proteomics dataset of drought-responsive traits, our dendrogram-guided\nSGMoE selects two experts, exposes a clear mixing-measure hierarchy, stabilizes\nthe likelihood early, and yields interpretable genotype-phenotype maps,\noutperforming standard criteria without multi-size training.",

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view\ngraph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework\npartitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local\ninteractions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view\nrepresentations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing\narchitecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we\nformally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk\ncompared to single-graph message-passing models.

    "summary": "As sixth generation (6G) wireless networks evolve, accurate\nsignal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) maps are becoming increasingly\ncritical for effective resource management and optimization. However, acquiring\nsuch maps at high resolution is often cost-prohibitive, creating a severe data\nscarcity challenge. This necessitates machine learning (ML) approaches capable\nof robustly reconstructing the full map from extremely sparse measurements. To\naddress this, we introduce a novel reconstruction framework based on Group\nEquivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs). Unlike data-hungry ML models,\nGENEOs are low-complexity operators that embed domain-specific geometric\npriors, such as translation invariance, directly into their structure. This\nprovides a strong inductive bias, enabling effective reconstruction from very\nfew samples. Our key insight is that for network management, preserving the\ntopological structure of the SINR map, such as the geometry of coverage holes\nand interference patterns, is often more critical than minimizing pixel-wise\nerror. We validate our approach on realistic ray-tracing-based urban scenarios,\nevaluating performance with both traditional statistical metrics (mean squared\nerror (MSE)) and, crucially, a topological metric (1-Wasserstein distance).\nResults show that while maintaining competitive MSE, our method dramatically\noutperforms established ML baselines in topological fidelity. This demonstrates\nthe practical advantage of GENEOs for creating structurally accurate SINR maps\nthat are more reliable for downstream network optimization tasks.",

In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and\nreducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees\nup the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we\nintroduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group\nResidual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear\nand non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to\napproximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support\nlower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,\nLLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B\nand Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning\ntasks.

Our contributions include a novel compression\ntechnique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization\nmethods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit\nmemory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.\nThis work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs\non edge devices.",

This question has not been explored for large audio-language models\n(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.\nReasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract\nrelevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying\ntargeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early\nanswering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:\nSAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across\nseveral datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally\nproduce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.",

    "summary": "Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical\nfor ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory\ncompliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS\ntrajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled\ndata, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense\nsampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address\ndata sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that\nadaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.\nBuilding upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to\ncapture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we\ndevelop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths\nthese indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we\nconstruct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with\nLTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision\nacross the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final\nself-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively\nimprove predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854\nand AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.\nThe code and dataset are publicly available at\n\\href{https://github.com/pangjunbiao/Abnormal-Stop-Detection-SSL.git}",

    "summary": "Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through\ntheir model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due\nto the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability\non large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on\nunivariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial\ninformation from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further\nenhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware\nadaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of\nfoundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from\nvarious modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the\nquality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of\ninitialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved\nbackbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome\nembeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative\nthan raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)\nto automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with\nrespect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a\nzero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic\nforgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous\ninformation. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses\nstate-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot\ntraining samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.\nCompared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with\nvarious advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,\npresenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.",

This smaller-footprint design is computationally lean and\nreliable under low signal-to-noise, crucial for daily production at scale. At\nIncrease Alpha, we built a deep-learning framework that maps over 800 U.S.\nequities into daily directional signals with minimal computational overhead.\n  The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we outline the general overview\nof the predictive model without disclosing its core underlying concepts.\nSecond, we evaluate its real-time performance through transparent, industry\nstandard metrics. Forecast accuracy is benchmarked against both naive baselines\nand macro indicators. The performance outcomes are summarized via cumulative\nreturns, annualized Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. The best portfolio\ncombination using our signals provides a low-risk, continuous stream of returns\nwith a Sharpe ratio of more than 2.5, maximum drawdown of around 3%, and a\nnear-zero correlation with the S&P 500 market benchmark. We also compare the\nmodel's performance through different market regimes, such as the recent\nvolatile movements of the US equity market in the beginning of 2025.

    "summary": "Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its\nreliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.\nClassical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges\nproportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive\npreprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge\nsampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral\nclustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated\n$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\\Upsilon(k) =\n\\lambda_{k+1} / \\rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace\nused for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\\gamma^2\nn \\log n / \\epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition\nnumber, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is\napproximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the\nspectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our\nanalysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a\nrank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound\nadapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance\nsampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based\nclustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong\nclusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware.

    "summary": "Dimension reduction (DR) algorithms have proven to be extremely useful for\ngaining insight into large-scale high-dimensional datasets, particularly\nfinding clusters in transcriptomic data. The initial phase of these DR methods\noften involves converting the original high-dimensional data into a graph. In\nthis graph, each edge represents the similarity or dissimilarity between pairs\nof data points. However, this graph is frequently suboptimal due to unreliable\nhigh-dimensional distances and the limited information extracted from the\nhigh-dimensional data. This problem is exacerbated as the dataset size\nincreases. If we reduce the size of the dataset by selecting points for a\nspecific sections of the embeddings, the clusters observed through DR are more\nseparable since the extracted subgraphs are more reliable. In this paper, we\nintroduce LocalMAP, a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that dynamically\nand locally adjusts the graph to address this challenge. By dynamically\nextracting subgraphs and updating the graph on-the-fly, LocalMAP is capable of\nidentifying and separating real clusters within the data that other DR methods\nmay overlook or combine. We demonstrate the benefits of LocalMAP through a case\nstudy on biological datasets, highlighting its utility in helping users more\naccurately identify clusters for real-world problems.",

By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen\nweights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,\nsimulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning.

    "summary": "Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time\nSDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue\nin this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level\nand the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We\nrefer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we\ndemonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and\nexhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both\nout-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address\nthis problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective\ncorrection method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain\nconsistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a\nclassifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a\nnoise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the\nneed for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet\ngeneration and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently\nmitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of\nmainstream diffusion models.",

    "summary": "Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of\nreal-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different\npatterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven\nbeneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a\nsingle scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information\nindependently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the\ndynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.\nMoreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding\nwindows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual\ninformation. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time\nseries Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window\nmodeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that\nreconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing\ncross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and\nincorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by\nfixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world\ndatasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,\ndemonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.",

To avoid the\nlabor-intensive process of collecting and annotating real crowd video data, we\nleverage large language models (LLMs) to bootstrap synthetic datasets of crowd\nscenarios. We propose a time-expanded graph representation, encoding actions,\ninteractions, and spatial context. Gen-C employs a dual Variational Graph\nAutoencoder (VGAE) architecture that jointly learns connectivity patterns and\nnode features conditioned on textual and structural signals, overcoming the\nlimitations of direct LLM generation to enable scalable, environment-aware\nmulti-agent crowd simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gen-C on\nscenarios with diverse behaviors such as a University Campus and a Train\nStation, showing that it generates heterogeneous crowds, coherent interactions,\nand high-level decision-making patterns consistent with real-world crowd\ndynamics.",

    "summary": "Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product\nto maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature\ntypically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the\nfirm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both\ninventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge\nlies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is\nunknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a\nspecific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of\nreinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.\nHowever, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the\napplicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process\n(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive\nmodeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of\nthe price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --\na sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based\nalgorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide\nregret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency\nof our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based\nmethods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,\nwhile requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness.

To be\nless dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a\nself-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks\nwith limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely\nfor homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not\nconsider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data\nand the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this\npaper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale\nheterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which\naims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design\na semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we\nconstruct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal\nwith the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the\ngeneral knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in\nlearning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments\nare conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

Recent GBC methods often\nemploy diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are\ngenerated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without\nreplanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and\ngeneralization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action\nsampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL\ncontrol suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy\nor dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel\ntechniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1)\nself-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations\nand implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking,\nwhich selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity\noutweigh the need for temporal consistency.

    "summary": "Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed\ninteger linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much\nfaster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,\nwhich predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual\nperspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality\nconstraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has\nbeen largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based\nmodel reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two\nchallenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing\nthem can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to\npredict these critical constraints efficiently.

    "title": "Persistent Homology via Ellipsoids",
    "summary": "Persistent homology is one of the most popular methods in topological data\nanalysis. An initial step in its use involves constructing a nested sequence of\nsimplicial complexes. There is an abundance of different complexes to choose\nfrom, with \\v{C}ech, Rips, alpha, and witness complexes being popular choices.\nIn this manuscript, we build a novel type of geometrically informed simplicial\ncomplex, called a Rips-type ellipsoid complex. This complex is based on the\nidea that ellipsoids aligned with tangent directions better approximate the\ndata compared to conventional (Euclidean) balls centered at sample points, as\nused in the construction of Rips and Alpha complexes. We use Principal\nComponent Analysis to estimate tangent spaces directly from samples and present\nan algorithm for computing Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes, i.e., topological\ndescriptors based on Rips-type ellipsoid complexes. Additionally, we show that\nthe ellipsoid barcodes depend continuously on the input data so that small\nperturbations of a k-generic point cloud lead to proportionally small changes\nin the resulting ellipsoid barcodes. This provides a theoretical guarantee\nanalogous, if somewhat weaker, to the classical stability results for Rips and\n\\v{C}ech filtrations. We also conduct extensive experiments and compare\nRips-type ellipsoid barcodes with standard Rips barcodes. Our findings indicate\nthat Rips-type ellipsoid complexes are particularly effective for estimating\nthe homology of manifolds and spaces with bottlenecks from samples. In\nparticular, the persistence intervals corresponding to ground-truth topological\nfeatures are longer compared to those obtained using the Rips complex of the\ndata. Furthermore, Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes lead to better classification\nresults in sparsely sampled point clouds. Finally, we demonstrate that\nRips-type ellipsoid barcodes outperform Rips barcodes in classification tasks.",

    "summary": "Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a\nsignificant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents\nnovel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value\nanalysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across\nThailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge\nstations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers\nexplainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices\nthat potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention\nNetwork with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention\nmechanism using initial edge features derived from simple\norographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently\nprocessed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold\n(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto\nDistribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional\nmachine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nwell-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to\nextremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art.

However, such approaches remain\nvulnerable against adversarial examples, i.e., examples that are subtly\nmanipulated to fool a machine learning model into making incorrect predictions.\nThis research presents DeepTrust, a novel metaheuristic that arranges flexible\nclassifiers, like deep neural networks, into an ordered sequence where the\nfinal decision is made by a single internal model based on conditions activated\nin cascade. In the Robust Android Malware Detection competition at the 2025\nIEEE Conference SaTML, DeepTrust secured the first place and achieved\nstate-of-the-art results, outperforming the next-best competitor by up to 266%\nunder feature-space evasion attacks. This is accomplished while maintaining the\nhighest detection rate on non-adversarial malware and a false positive rate\nbelow 1%. The method's efficacy stems from maximizing the divergence of the\nlearned representations among the internal models. By using classifiers\ninducing fundamentally dissimilar embeddings of the data, the decision space\nbecomes unpredictable for an attacker.

    "summary": "Numerous heuristics and advanced approaches have been proposed for\nexploration in different settings for deep reinforcement learning. Noise-based\nexploration generally fares well with dense-shaped rewards and bonus-based\nexploration with sparse rewards. However, these methods usually require\nadditional tuning to deal with undesirable reward settings by adjusting\nhyperparameters and noise distributions. Rewards that actively discourage\nexploration, i.e., with an action cost and no other dense signal to follow, can\npose a major challenge. We propose a novel exploration method, Stable\nError-seeking Exploration (SEE), that is robust across dense, sparse, and\nexploration-adverse reward settings. To this endeavor, we revisit the idea of\nmaximizing the TD-error as a separate objective. Our method introduces three\ndesign choices to mitigate instability caused by far-off-policy learning, the\nconflict of interest of maximizing the cumulative TD-error in an episodic\nsetting, and the non-stationary nature of TD-errors. SEE can be combined with\noff-policy algorithms without modifying the optimization pipeline of the\noriginal objective. In our experimental analysis, we show that a Soft-Actor\nCritic agent with the addition of SEE performs robustly across three diverse\nreward settings in a variety of tasks without hyperparameter adjustments.",

    "summary": "Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural\nactivity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by\ndendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit\ndistinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor\nconfigurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches\ntypically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits\nthe performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni,\nthe first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and\nMEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the\nfirst tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete\nrepresentations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that\nencodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type,\nenabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the\ndiscrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain\nsignals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the\nfirst foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the\nfirst to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG\nand 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available\nsources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both\nexisting foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range\nof downstream tasks.

    "summary": "Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces\nchallenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving\nhigh-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine\n(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier\nfeature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it\ndifficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find\nan alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we\nintegrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,\nso there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we\nassign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM\nnetwork to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,\nwe develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these\nhyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM\nnot only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM\nframework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle\nhigh-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten\nnumerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed\nGFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,\nirregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the\nGFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without\nadditional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results\nconfirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and\nvariable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may\nfurther inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)\nframeworks.",

More\nfundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial\nproblems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in\nmin-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action\ntrajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct\nsequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and\nthe ability to learn coordinated behavior.\n  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over\njoint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task\nassignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,\nwe employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert\nassignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and\nthe model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating\nmulti-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution\ngeneration phase of the self-improvement loop.

To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC,\na framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with\nReal Business Cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover\ntextbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the\nmean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3)\neffectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for\ntraditional GE approaches.

    "summary": "In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model\n- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which\ncreates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One\nshould thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into\naccount that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without\nknowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization\ncan help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in\nhigh-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects\nworsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the\nover-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of\nsamples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall\nstrength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the\nregularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding\nthrough empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets.",

    "summary": "Chance constrained programming (CCP) is a powerful framework for addressing\noptimization problems under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nGradient-Guided Diffusion-based Optimization framework, termed GGDOpt, which\ntackles CCP through three key innovations. First, GGDOpt accommodates a broad\nclass of CCP problems without requiring the knowledge of the exact distribution\nof uncertainty-relying solely on a set of samples. Second, to address the\nnonconvexity of the chance constraints, it reformulates the CCP as a sampling\nproblem over the product of two distributions: an unknown data distribution\nsupported on a nonconvex set and a Boltzmann distribution defined by the\nobjective function, which fully leverages both first- and second-order gradient\ninformation. Third, GGDOpt has theoretical convergence guarantees and provides\npractical error bounds under mild assumptions. By progressively injecting noise\nduring the forward diffusion process to convexify the nonconvex feasible\nregion, GGDOpt enables guided reverse sampling to generate asymptotically\noptimal solutions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and a waveform\ndesign task in wireless communications demonstrate that GGDOpt outperforms\nexisting methods in both solution quality and stability with nearly 80%\noverhead reduction.",

    "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling\ngraph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social\nnetwork analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models\n(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich\ntextual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based\nlearning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical\nvulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both\ntheir structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack\nmethods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified\nthem into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable\nMulti-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial\nattack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both\ngraph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated\nmodules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a\ndeeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical\nanalysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and\narchitectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack\neffectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By\nexposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers\na previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,\noffering valuable insights for improving their resilience.

In this\nstudy, we propose Mirror Descent Actor Critic (MDAC) as an actor-critic style\ninstantiation of MDVI for continuous action domains, and show that its\nempirical performance is significantly boosted by bounding the actor's\nlog-density terms in the critic's loss function, compared to a non-bounded\nnaive instantiation.

    "summary": "Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our\nunderstanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically\nanalyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single\nenvironmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic\nmicrobial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from\ndifferent environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial\ncommunities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological\nconditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating\nboth spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed\npublicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time\npoints, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations\nusing our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates\nalgorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same\nenvironmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from\nmultiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of\nconventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not\nentirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network\ninference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing\nrelevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard\napproaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser\ngenerates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results\ndemonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing\nalgorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments\n(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in\ncross-environment (All) scenarios.",

While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by\nlearning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability\nand fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that\nenable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we\nintroduce \\textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that\nachieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.\nGrounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion\ndynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear\noperators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only\neliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate\nstates, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the\nmulti-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that\ndisentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific\nKoopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We\nempirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves\ncompetitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled\nmechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through\nspectral analysis.

Therefore, the community has been\nfocusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation.

We introduce a new task called controllable collision\nscenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a\nuser-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of\nautomatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we\npresent COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by\ntransforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across\nfive representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a\nframework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable\nrepresentation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the\nadversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial\ntrajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines\nin both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios\nconsistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of\nexisting planners.

To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present\na minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection\nfor small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity\nand reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that\nself-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are\nproperly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a\nfew million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and\nreflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer\nmultiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement\nlearning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent\nreflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical\npatterns without faithfully reducing verification errors.

    "title": "Graph Few-Shot Learning via Adaptive Spectrum Experts and Cross-Set\n  Distribution Calibration",
    "summary": "Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability\nto rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite\nthe remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,\nseveral key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on\npredefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to\nglobally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral\noperations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological\nstructures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume\nthat the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,\nunder few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not\nsufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to\nsuboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a\nnovel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum\nexperts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the\nproposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local\nstructural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,\nGRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range\nof experimental settings. Our code can be found here.",

    "summary": "Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine\nlearning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose\na new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation\ncost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from\nnumerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of\nGPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.\nSpecifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to\naccelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit\nclustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the\ncovariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the\noff-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space\ncomplexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely\non exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the\nhyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by\neliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit\nto efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,\nnuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up\nto 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best\nexisting GPU-based GPR implementation.",

Recent methods\nleverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared\nrepresentation space using contrastive learning.

This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods\nassume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In\nreality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical\nbranching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure\nproperties.

To further enhance generalization ability while reducing\ntraining costs, this paper proposes Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop), a\nnew framework that applies dropout to the rows and columns of the trainable\nmatrix in Federated LoRA. A generalization error bound and convergence analysis\nunder sparsity regularization are obtained, which elucidate the fundamental\ntrade-off between underfitting and overfitting. The error bound reveals that a\nhigher dropout rate increases model sparsity, thereby lowering the upper bound\nof pointwise hypothesis stability (PHS). While this reduces the gap between\nempirical and generalization errors, it also incurs a higher empirical error,\nwhich, together with the gap, determines the overall generalization error. On\nthe other hand, though dropout reduces communication costs, deploying FedLoDrop\nat the network edge still faces challenges due to limited network resources. To\naddress this issue, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper\nbound of the generalization error, by jointly optimizing the dropout rate and\nresource allocation subject to the latency and per-device energy consumption\nconstraints. To solve this problem, a branch-and-bound (B\\&B)-based method is\nproposed to obtain its globally optimal solution.

Additionally, the\nmodel utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual\nembeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent\nembeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the\nheterogeneous scholarly network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that the MIARec model outperforms baseline models across\nthree primary evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in scientific\npaper recommendation tasks.",

We develop two\nindependent machine learning models based on the Vision Transformer to estimate\neffective spin and chirp mass from spectrograms of gravitational wave signals\nfrom binary black hole mergers. To enhance the reliability of these models, we\nutilize attention maps to visualize the areas our models focus on when making\npredictions.

Furthermore,\nby leveraging these attention maps, we demonstrate a method to quantify the\nimpact of glitches on parameter estimation.

    "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in graph\nrepresentation learning across various real-world applications. However, they\noften produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as\nreligion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing\nmethods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs.\nHowever, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using\neither node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but\nfrequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of\navailable graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective\nstrategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation.\nSpecifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning\nframework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model\nto guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically,\nFairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a\nstructure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model\nlearning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data\nto mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate\ngraph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information\nduring training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the\ncomprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving\nhigh model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation\nlearning for GNNs.",

    "summary": "Algorithms that balance the stability-plasticity trade-off are well studied\nin the Continual Learning literature. However, only a few focus on obtaining\nmodels for specified trade-off preferences. When solving the problem of\ncontinual learning under specific trade-offs (CLuST), state-of-the-art\ntechniques leverage rehearsal-based learning, which requires retraining when a\nmodel corresponding to a new trade-off preference is requested. This is\ninefficient, since there potentially exists a significant number of different\ntrade-offs, and a large number of models may be requested. As a response, we\npropose Imprecise Bayesian Continual Learning (IBCL), an algorithm that tackles\nCLuST efficiently. IBCL replaces retraining with a constant-time convex\ncombination. Given a new task, IBCL (1) updates the knowledge base as a convex\nhull of model parameter distributions, and (2) generates one Pareto-optimal\nmodel per given trade-off via convex combination without additional training.\nThat is, obtaining models corresponding to specified trade-offs via IBCL is\nzero-shot. Experiments whose baselines are current CLuST algorithms show that\nIBCL improves classification by at most 44% on average per task accuracy, and\nby 45% on peak per task accuracy while maintaining a near-zero to positive\nbackward transfer, with memory overheads converging to constants. In addition,\nits training overhead, measured by the number of batch updates, remains\nconstant at every task, regardless of the number of preferences requested.

We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,\nan attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This\nparallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of\nnatural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel\nattempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation\nprocess. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent\nactivations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's\noutput units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -\nreformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during\ninference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying\nthe Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To\ndemonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy\nTransformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's\nprediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain\ninsights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.",

    "summary": "It remains difficult to evaluate machine learning classifiers in the absence\nof a large, labeled dataset. While labeled data can be prohibitively expensive\nor impossible to obtain, unlabeled data is plentiful. Here, we introduce\nSemi-Supervised Model Evaluation (SSME), a method that uses both labeled and\nunlabeled data to evaluate machine learning classifiers. SSME is the first\nevaluation method to take advantage of the fact that: (i) there are frequently\nmultiple classifiers for the same task, (ii) continuous classifier scores are\noften available for all classes, and (iii) unlabeled data is often far more\nplentiful than labeled data. The key idea is to use a semi-supervised mixture\nmodel to estimate the joint distribution of ground truth labels and classifier\npredictions. We can then use this model to estimate any metric that is a\nfunction of classifier scores and ground truth labels (e.g., accuracy or\nexpected calibration error). We present experiments in four domains where\nobtaining large labeled datasets is often impractical: (1) healthcare, (2)\ncontent moderation, (3) molecular property prediction, and (4) image\nannotation. Our results demonstrate that SSME estimates performance more\naccurately than do competing methods, reducing error by 5.1x relative to using\nlabeled data alone and 2.4x relative to the next best competing method. SSME\nalso improves accuracy when evaluating performance across subsets of the test\ndistribution (e.g., specific demographic subgroups) and when evaluating the\nperformance of language models.",

For this, we will need proxies that provide similar functions to HTTP\nproxies (e.g., caching, routing, compression) while dealing with unique\nchallenges and opportunities of prompt-based communication. As a first step\ntoward supporting prompt-based communication, we present LLMBridge, an LLM\nproxy designed for cost-conscious users, such as those in developing regions\nand education (e.g., students, instructors).

Although a convergence\nrate of $T^{-1}$ has long been established since Nemirovski's mirror-prox\nalgorithm and Nesterov's excessive gap technique in the early 2000s, the most\neffective paradigm in practice is *counterfactual regret minimization*, which\nis based on *regret matching* and its modern variants. In particular, the state\nof the art across most benchmarks is *predictive* regret matching$^+$\n(PRM$^+$), in conjunction with non-uniform averaging. Yet, such algorithms can\nexhibit slower $\\Omega(T^{-1/2})$ convergence even in self-play.\n  In this paper, we close the gap between theory and practice. We propose a new\nscale-invariant and parameter-free variant of PRM$^+$, which we call\nIREG-PRM$^+$. We show that it achieves $T^{-1/2}$ best-iterate and $T^{-1}$\n(i.e., optimal) average-iterate convergence guarantees, while also being on par\nwith PRM$^+$ on benchmark games. From a technical standpoint, we draw an\nanalogy between IREG-PRM$^+$ and optimistic gradient descent with *adaptive*\nlearning rate. The basic flaw of PRM$^+$ is that the ($\\ell_2$-)norm of the\nregret vector -- which can be thought of as the inverse of the learning rate --\ncan decrease. By contrast, we design IREG-PRM$^+$ so as to maintain the\ninvariance that the norm of the regret vector is nondecreasing. This enables us\nto derive an RVU-type bound for IREG-PRM$^+$, the first such property that does\nnot rely on introducing additional hyperparameters to enforce smoothness.\n  Furthermore, we find that IREG-PRM$^+$ performs on par with an adaptive\nversion of optimistic gradient descent that we introduce whose learning rate\ndepends on the misprediction error, demystifying the effectiveness of the\nregret matching family *vis-a-vis* more standard optimization techniques.",

    "summary": "Neural scaling laws are observed in a range of domains, to date with no\nuniversal understanding of why they occur. Recent theories suggest that loss\npower laws arise from Zipf's law, a power law observed in domains like natural\nlanguage. One theory suggests that language scaling laws emerge when\nZipf-distributed task quanta are learned in descending order of frequency. In\nthis paper we examine power-law scaling in AlphaZero, a reinforcement learning\nalgorithm, using a model of language-model scaling. We find that game states in\ntraining and inference data scale with Zipf's law, which is known to arise from\nthe tree structure of the environment, and examine the correlation between\nscaling-law and Zipf's-law exponents. In agreement with the quanta scaling\nmodel, we find that agents optimize state loss in descending order of\nfrequency, even though this order scales inversely with modelling complexity.\nWe also find that inverse scaling, the failure of models to improve with size,\nis correlated with unusual Zipf curves where end-game states are among the most\nfrequent states. We show evidence that larger models shift their focus to these\nless-important states, sacrificing their understanding of important early-game\nstates.",

We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the\nadversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the\nexpected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating\nstochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ\nvalue derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are\nsimultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to\ntransition uncertainty.

    "summary": "Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the\nbackbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link\nprediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for\nexploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and\nrelations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture\nunderlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on\nassumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World\nAssumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open\nWorld Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,\nwhile explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false\nand unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often\noverlooked during embedding training.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly\ndeclared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our\napproach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are\ntrained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative\nstatements. During training, each model generates negative samples by\ncorrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored\nby the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose\nand domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and\ntriple classification tasks.

    "summary": "Modeling rarefied hypersonic flows remains a fundamental challenge due to the\nbreakdown of classical continuum assumptions in the transition-continuum\nregime, where the Knudsen number ranges from approximately 0.1 to 10.\nConventional Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) models with empirical slip-wall\nboundary conditions fail to accurately predict nonequilibrium effects such as\nvelocity slip, temperature jump, and shock structure deviations. We develop a\nphysics-constrained machine learning framework that augments transport models\nand boundary conditions to extend the applicability of continuum solvers in\nnonequilibrium hypersonic regimes. We employ deep learning PDE models (DPMs)\nfor the viscous stress and heat flux embedded in the governing PDEs and trained\nvia adjoint-based optimization. We evaluate these for two-dimensional\nsupersonic flat-plate flows across a range of Mach and Knudsen numbers.\nAdditionally, we introduce a wall model based on a mixture of skewed Gaussian\napproximations of the particle velocity distribution function. This wall model\nreplaces empirical slip conditions with physically informed, data-driven\nboundary conditions for the streamwise velocity and wall temperature. Our\nresults show that a trace-free anisotropic viscosity model, paired with the\nskewed-Gaussian distribution function wall model, achieves significantly\nimproved accuracy, particularly at high-Mach and high-Knudsen number regimes.\nStrategies such as parallel training across multiple Knudsen numbers and\ninclusion of high-Mach data during training are shown to enhance model\ngeneralization. Increasing model complexity yields diminishing returns for\nout-of-sample cases, underscoring the need to balance degrees of freedom and\noverfitting.

Using real-life event logs, we\nconstruct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric\nfeatures, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,\nand handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and\ncompare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior.

However, the\nclassical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to\ninstability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or\ndata-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the\nso-called soft-constrained Schr\\\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the\nterminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation\nleads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.\n  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and\nprove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions\nconverge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on\nDoob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\\\"odinger\npotentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an\noptimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic\noptimal transport problem.

    "summary": "The widespread adoption of advanced video codecs such as AV1 is often\nhindered by their high decoding complexity, posing a challenge for\nbattery-constrained devices. While encoders can be configured to produce\nbitstreams that are decoder-friendly, estimating the decoding complexity and\nenergy overhead for a given video is non-trivial. In this study, we\nsystematically analyse the impact of disabling various coding tools and\nadjusting coding parameters in two AV1 encoders, libaom-av1 and SVT-AV1. Using\nsystem-level energy measurement tools like RAPL (Running Average Power Limit),\nIntel SoC Watch (integrated with VTune profiler), we quantify the resulting\ntrade-offs between decoding complexity, energy consumption, and compression\nefficiency for decoding a bitstream. Our results demonstrate that specific\nencoder configurations can substantially reduce decoding complexity with\nminimal perceptual quality degradation. For libaom-av1, disabling CDEF, an\nin-loop filter gives us a mean reduction in decoding cycles by 10%. For\nSVT-AV1, using the in-built, fast-decode=2 preset achieves a more substantial\n24% reduction in decoding cycles. These findings provide strategies for content\nproviders to lower the energy footprint of AV1 video streaming.",

    "summary": "The accompanying actions and gestures in dialogue are often closely linked to\ninteractions with the environment, such as looking toward the interlocutor or\nusing gestures to point to the described target at appropriate moments. Speech\nand semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing\n(WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects\ndictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely\nsolely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce\nnon-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive\ntiming and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of\nconversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game\nand animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack\nsolution. We first established a unique data collection method to\nsimultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent.

    "summary": "Freehand sketches exhibit unique sparsity and abstraction, necessitating\nlearning pipelines distinct from those designed for images. For sketch learning\nmethods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information\nembedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes\neffective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of\nexisting approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level\nSketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective\ninformation. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels:\nsketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the\ngranularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine\n(point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch\ninformation. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental\nevaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the\nabove studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to\nexploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph\ncomprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as\nnodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense\nGraph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level\nrepresentation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with\ndown-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both\nencoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two\ngraphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of\nsketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\\% and\n1.70\\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively,\nand 36.58\\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality.",

Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to\nmaximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and\ntext representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical\nanalysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction\nresult in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge\nstructures and impairing generalization.

We demonstrate that our approach\ncombines the strengths of both spatial reduced order models (ROMs) as well as\nspectral decompositions. By optimizing for the operator that evolves a system\nstate from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we\ngain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive\nphysical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular\ninterest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of\nhigh demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and\ntemporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence.\n  We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead,\nincorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with\nrandomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc)\nfacilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We\ndemonstrate the technique's robustness across diverse simulation scenarios,\nincluding artistic editing, time-reversal, and super-resolution.\n  Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding\nvortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method also exhibits superior\nperformance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to\nexisting spatial ROMs. The inherent linearity of the DMD operator enables\nunique application modes, such as time-reversible fluid simulation.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the problem of generating dynamically admissible\ntrajectories for control tasks using diffusion models, particularly in\nscenarios where the environment is complex and system dynamics are crucial for\npractical application. We propose a novel framework that integrates system\ndynamics directly into the diffusion model's denoising process through a\nsequential prediction and projection mechanism. This mechanism, aligned with\nthe diffusion model's noising schedule, ensures generated trajectories are both\nconsistent with expert demonstrations and adhere to underlying physical\nconstraints. Notably, our approach can generate maximum likelihood trajectories\nand accurately recover trajectories generated by linear feedback controllers,\neven when explicit dynamics knowledge is unavailable. We validate the\neffectiveness of our method through experiments on standard control tasks and a\ncomplex non-convex optimal control problem involving waypoint tracking and\ncollision avoidance, demonstrating its potential for efficient trajectory\ngeneration in practical applications.

    "summary": "While game-theoretic planning frameworks are effective at modeling\nmulti-agent interactions, they require solving large optimization problems\nwhere the number of variables increases with the number of agents, resulting in\nlong computation times that limit their use in large-scale, real-time systems.\nTo address this issue, we propose 1) PSN Game: a learning-based, game-theoretic\nprediction and planning framework that reduces runtime by learning a Player\nSelection Network (PSN); and 2) a Goal Inference Network (GIN) that makes it\npossible to use the PSN in incomplete information games where agents'\nintentions are unknown. A PSN outputs a player selection mask that\ndistinguishes influential players from less relevant ones, enabling the ego\nplayer to solve a smaller, masked game involving only selected players. By\nreducing the number of players in the game, and therefore reducing the number\nof variables in the corresponding optimization problem, PSN directly lowers\ncomputation time. The PSN Game framework is more flexible than existing player\nselection methods as it 1) relies solely on observations of players' past\ntrajectories, without requiring full state, action, or other game-specific\ninformation; and 2) requires no online parameter tuning. Experiments in both\nsimulated scenarios and human trajectory datasets demonstrate that PSNs\noutperform baseline selection methods in 1) prediction accuracy; and 2)\nplanning safety. PSNs also generalize effectively to real-world scenarios in\nwhich agents' objectives are unknown without fine-tuning. By selecting only the\nmost relevant players for decision-making, PSN Game offers a general mechanism\nfor reducing planning complexity that can be seamlessly integrated into\nexisting multi-agent planning frameworks.",

Industrial standards\nsupporting system engineering and production typically (i) address the\nproduction phase only, but do not cover the complete product life cycle, and\n(ii) focus on production processes and resources rather than the products\nthemselves. The presented approach is motivated by incorporating the impacts of\nthe end-of-life phase of the product life cycle into the engineering phase.\nThis paper proposes a modeling approach coming up from the\nProduct-Process-Resource (PPR) modeling paradigm. It combines requirements on\n(i) respecting the product structure as a basis for the model, and (ii)\nincorporates repairing, remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical\nproduction systems. The proposed model called PoPAN should accompany the\nproduct during the entire life cycle as a digital shadow encapsulated within\nthe Asset Administration Shell of a product. To facilitate the adoption of the\nproposed paradigm, the paper also proposes serialization of the model in the\nAutomationML data format.

    "summary": "Tactile perception is crucial for embodied intelligent robots to recognize\nobjects. Vision-based tactile sensors extract object physical attributes\nmultidimensionally using high spatial resolution; however, this process\ngenerates abundant redundant information. Furthermore, single-dimensional\nextraction, lacking effective fusion, fails to fully characterize object\nattributes. These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition accuracy. To\naddress this issue, this study introduces a two-stream network feature\nextraction and fusion perception strategy for vision-based tactile systems.\nThis strategy employs a distributed approach to extract internal and external\nobject features. It obtains depth map information through three-dimensional\nreconstruction while simultaneously acquiring hardness information by measuring\ncontact force data. After extracting features with a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN), weighted fusion is applied to create a more informative and\neffective feature representation. In standard tests on objects of varying\nshapes and hardness, the force prediction error is 0.06 N (within a 12 N\nrange). Hardness recognition accuracy reaches 98.0%, and shape recognition\naccuracy reaches 93.75%. With fusion algorithms, object recognition accuracy in\nactual grasping scenarios exceeds 98.5%.

    "summary": "Pruning is an essential agricultural practice for orchards. Proper pruning\ncan promote healthier growth and optimize fruit production throughout the\norchard's lifespan. Robot manipulators have been developed as an automated\nsolution for this repetitive task, which typically requires seasonal labor with\nspecialized skills. While previous research has primarily focused on the\nchallenges of perception, the complexities of manipulation are often\noverlooked. These challenges involve planning and control in both joint and\nCartesian spaces to guide the end-effector through intricate, obstructive\nbranches. Our work addresses the behavior planning challenge for a robotic\npruning system, which entails a multi-level planning problem in environments\nwith complex collisions. In this paper, we formulate the planning problem for a\nhigh-dimensional robotic arm in a pruning scenario, investigate the system's\nintrinsic redundancies, and propose a comprehensive pruning workflow that\nintegrates perception, modeling, and holistic planning. In our experiments, we\ndemonstrate that more comprehensive planning methods can significantly enhance\nthe performance of the robotic manipulator. Finally, we implement the proposed\nworkflow on a real-world robot. As a result, this work complements previous\nefforts on robotic pruning and motivates future research and development in\nplanning for pruning applications.",

However, safety mechanisms\nusually hinder task efficiency since human intervention will cause backup\nmotions and goal failures of the robot.

In this paper, we\npresent a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) planning framework which is\ncomprised of an interactive motion planner and a RL task planner. The RL task\nplanner attempts to choose statistically safe and efficient task sequences\nbased on the feedback from the motion planner, while the motion planner keeps\nthe task execution process collision-free by detecting human arm motions and\ndeploying new paths when the previous path is not valid anymore. Intuitively,\nthe RL agent will learn to avoid dangerous tasks, while the motion planner\nensures that the chosen tasks are safe. The proposed framework is validated on\nthe cobot in both simulation and the real world, we compare the planner with\nhard-coded task motion planning methods. The results show that our planning\nframework can 1) react to uncertain human motions at both joint and task\nlevels; 2) reduce the times of repeating failed goal commands; 3) reduce the\ntotal number of replanning requests.",

Recent advances in VLN by large pretrained models have\nsignificantly improved generalization and instruction grounding compared to\ntraditional approaches. However, the role of reasoning strategies in\nnavigation-an action-centric, long-horizon task-remains underexplored, despite\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning's demonstrated success in static tasks like\nvisual question answering. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic\nevaluation of reasoning strategies for VLN, including No-Think (direct action\nprediction), Pre-Think (reason before action), and Post-Think (reason after\naction). Surprisingly, our findings reveal the Inference-time Reasoning\nCollapse issue, where inference-time reasoning degrades navigation accuracy,\nhighlighting the challenges of integrating reasoning into VLN.

    "title": "Shape-Aware Whole-Body Control for Continuum Robots with Application in\n  Endoluminal Surgical Robotics",
    "summary": "This paper presents a shape-aware whole-body control framework for\ntendon-driven continuum robots with direct application to endoluminal surgical\nnavigation. Endoluminal procedures, such as bronchoscopy, demand precise and\nsafe navigation through tortuous, patient-specific anatomy where conventional\ntip-only control often leads to wall contact, tissue trauma, or failure to\nreach distal targets. To address these challenges, our approach combines a\nphysics-informed backbone model with residual learning through an Augmented\nNeural ODE, enabling accurate shape estimation and efficient Jacobian\ncomputation. A sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller\nleverages this representation to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone\nconformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints. A task manager\nfurther enhances adaptability by allowing real-time adjustment of objectives,\nsuch as wall clearance or direct advancement, during tele-operation. Extensive\nsimulation studies demonstrate millimeter-level accuracy across diverse\nscenarios, including trajectory tracking, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and\nshape-constrained reaching. Real-robot experiments on a bronchoscopy phantom\nvalidate the framework, showing improved lumen-following accuracy, reduced wall\ncontacts, and enhanced adaptability compared to joystick-only navigation and\nexisting baselines. These results highlight the potential of the proposed\nframework to increase safety, reliability, and operator efficiency in minimally\ninvasive endoluminal surgery, with broader applicability to other confined and\nsafety-critical environments.",

    "title": "MTIL: Encoding Full History with Mamba for Temporal Imitation Learning",
    "summary": "Standard imitation learning (IL) methods have achieved considerable success\nin robotics, yet often rely on the Markov assumption, which falters in\nlong-horizon tasks where history is crucial for resolving perceptual ambiguity.\nThis limitation stems not only from a conceptual gap but also from a\nfundamental computational barrier: prevailing architectures like Transformers\nare often constrained by quadratic complexity, rendering the processing of\nlong, high-dimensional observation sequences infeasible. To overcome this dual\nchallenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL). Our approach\nrepresents a new paradigm for robotic learning, which we frame as a practical\nsynthesis of World Model and Dynamical System concepts. By leveraging the\nlinear-time recurrent dynamics of State Space Models (SSMs), MTIL learns an\nimplicit, action-oriented world model that efficiently encodes the entire\ntrajectory history into a compressed, evolving state. This allows the policy to\nbe conditioned on a comprehensive temporal context, transcending the confines\nof Markovian approaches. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks\n(ACT, Robomimic, LIBERO) and on challenging real-world tasks, MTIL demonstrates\nsuperior performance against SOTA methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy,\nparticularly in resolving long-term temporal ambiguities. Our findings not only\naffirm the necessity of full temporal context but also validate MTIL as a\npowerful and a computationally feasible approach for learning long-horizon,\nnon-Markovian behaviors from high-dimensional observations.",

    "summary": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently shown strong potential in\nenabling robots to follow language instructions and execute precise actions.\nHowever, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on\n2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to\noperate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate\nexplicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these\napproaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and\nincomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that\nestimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of\ndepth estimators.We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective\nalignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial\ncomprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth\nestimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric\nrepresentations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing\nalignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial\nrepresentations that enhance action precision.Extensive experiments in\nsimulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves\nstate-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further\naccelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse\nrobotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/",

    "summary": "Most existing robot manipulation methods prioritize task learning by\nenhancing perception through complex deep network architectures. However, they\nface challenges in real-time collision-free planning. Hence, Robotic Attention\nMamba (RAM) is designed for refined planning. Specifically, by integrating\nMamba and parallel single-view attention, RAM aligns multi-view vision and\ntask-related language features, ensuring efficient fine-grained task planning\nwith linear complexity and robust real-time performance. Nevertheless, it has\nthe potential for further improvement in high-precision grasping and\nmanipulation. Thus, Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA) is devised, with a\ngrasp pose feature extractor pretrained utilizing object grasp poses directly\ninherited from whole-task demonstrations. Subsequently, the extracted grasp\nfeatures are fused with the spatially aligned planning features from RAM\nthrough attention-based Pre-trained Location Fusion, preserving high-resolution\ngrasping cues overshadowed by an overemphasis on global planning. To summarize,\nwe propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba (GPA-RAM),\ndividing spatial task learning into RAM for planning skill learning and GPA for\ngrasping skill learning. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across three\nrobot systems with distinct camera configurations in simulation and the real\nworld. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, it improves the\nabsolute success rate by 8.2% (from 79.3% to 87.5%) on the RLBench multi-task\nbenchmark and 40% (from 16% to 56%), 12% (from 86% to 98%) on the ALOHA\nbimanual manipulation tasks, while delivering notably faster inference.\nFurthermore, experimental results demonstrate that both RAM and GPA enhance\ntask learning, with GPA proving robust to different architectures of pretrained\ngrasp pose feature extractors.

    "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a prominent paradigm for\nembodied intelligence, yet further performance improvements typically rely on\nscaling up training data and model size -- an approach that is prohibitively\nexpensive for robotics and fundamentally limited by data collection costs. We\naddress this limitation with $\\mathbf{RoVer}$, an embodied test-time scaling\nframework that uses a $\\mathbf{Ro}$bot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a\nTest-Time $\\mathbf{Ver}$ifier to enhance the capabilities of existing VLA\nmodels without modifying their architectures or weights. Specifically, RoVer\n(i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of\ncandidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate\nexpansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate\nactions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted\ndirections, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal\naction for execution. Notably, by caching shared perception features, it can\namortize perception cost and evaluate more candidates under the same test-time\ncomputational budget. Essentially, our approach effectively transforms\navailable computing resources into better action decision-making, realizing the\nbenefits of test-time scaling without extra training overhead. Our\ncontributions are threefold: (1) a general, plug-and-play test-time scaling\nframework for VLAs; (2) a PRM that jointly provides scalar process rewards and\nan action-space direction to guide exploration; and (3) an efficient\ndirection-guided sampling strategy that leverages a shared perception cache to\nenable scalable candidate generation and selection during inference.",
